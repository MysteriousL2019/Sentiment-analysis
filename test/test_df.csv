5,Thank you for great bottle service for bday and Halloween party and special gift!!! Always have a great bartenders and cocktail servers!!! Thank you for Brennan and Johnny!!!!!! :D,2
3,"The experience is fun and girly, but the food doesn't back it up.  Go for dessert or a cocktail, don't get a full meal. I don't think it's worth it.",1
5,"This deli is truly as good as it gets.  From the food, staff, customers, and the blues of course, this atmosphere creates something special in Saint Louis.  I'm there at least once a week and will continue to do so for many years to come.  If you haven't been there before, I guarantee you will be hooked after the first visit.",2
4,Great staff.  Nothing is ever disappointing - chili cheese etoufee is the BOMB.  It's a 4 instead of 5 stars because it's CASH ONLY.  But I love that you can also sit outside on nice evening.  Don't forget the garlic sauce!,2
4,"My friend lives across the street from here so we always find ourselves stopping in to grab some beers and snacks. Very convenient and like that you can make your own 6-packs. They carry a large variety of beers. Yes, you can easily spend a lot on beer here but I think it's worth it given that there's no min/max.. so you're not limited to getting a 6, 12, or 24 pack like you would be at the beer distributor and you don't have to commit to getting just one type of beer but can mix and match.",2
5,Looking at the photos of this place makes me homesick and I am not even from New Orleans! that's how much I miss going here...Sigh..... Great coffee. And who in the shit decided to combine coffee and liquor in a cool hipster coffeeshop ????? Come here let me give u a kiss!  Nice atmosphere friendly staff. Awesome white russions and angry irishman coffee...... Must stop by here if you go to NOLA..,2
3,Good food but the quality doesn't seem to justify the prices.  Seems they should lower the price point by a dollar or two for the entrees... $16 for a bowl seems a bit steep.,1
5,"Came to visit my daughter and we had dinner tonight.  I had been here before but my husband had not. We were looking at reviews and someone mentioned they loved their Bucatini Ronaldo so I decided to give it a try.  Waiter stated that the pasta for this dish is homemade (like tubed noodles) with shrimp, artichokes and roasted eggplant in a red sauce. While everything was delicious, I thought this dish was fantastic as it was unusual. It had all my favorite ingredients.  Our waiter Kubec was very attentive and service was great.  Overall......5 star worthy!  In fact my daughter is going back next weekend with 6 friends!",2
3,"Every night at The Barbary is a different experience. The general mood is ""foggy"" and depending on the night, there are a lot of hands in the air slapping the fog to the bass. Every time I would come here, I would see a classmate, Jay Blinsky. It was like it was his home, and I would feel comfortable knowing he was there. Jay wasn't there last night. That is my only complaint. If you get there early, you can get $1 PBRs. The music is always good.",1
2,"The only benefit to coming here is large portion size. Four of us went, we got spicy chicken, lomein, fried rice and the ahi bowl. The ahi bowl was ok, the rest was absolute garbage. All of the dishes were very bland, you would be better off getting the frozen Chinese food in the grocery store. Never coming back.",0
5,"Speaking as a current resident of the Florida gulf coast, and former resident of the central California coast, it pains me to admit it but the oysters at Luke are the best I've ever had. And I've had them picked same-day from the Monterey Bay. It surprised me to learn that the oysters are harvested from New Orleans, I had no idea that N.O. had access to such top notch shellfish. Anyways happy hour features deals on signature cocktails, 75 cent oysters and cheap apps, I went there twice during my week in N.O. and I should have gone more. Other than the amazing briny ice cold oysters, my wife and I also had a selection of various apps and cocktails all of which were in the good to excellent range. The one that really sticks out is the squash blossoms - do not miss this one even if trying new food scares you. They have a texture and flavor similar to a delicate bell pepper, and they are perfectly tempura battered and stuffed with tangy goat cheese with a little honey drizzle. It made me go home and plant a squash just so I can harvest the blossoms and recreate this dish. Luke hits a nice balance between casual and formal, from the atmosphere to the menu to the prices. Not to be missed.",2
5,"Beautiful restaurant in a great location!  Came in for dinner before heading to a show at The Straz. Best decision I made that day for sure!  I made reservations for an early dinner so I was seated at a comfortable booth. Menu was steak centric for sure so I went with the Ribeye. I also indulge in calamari, raw oysters and a bottle of Groth Cab. Service was top notch and the experience was first class all the way. The ribeye was spot on mid-rare. Calamari was the best I've had in Florida and the oysters (blue points) were as fresh as could be. And you know what else happened?  The GM, AGM and Executive Chef all stopped by the table to ensure everything was perfect. I felt like a Zagat critic!  Next time I'm in Tampa I'm making Timpano my first stop. Apparently they treat everyone like a big shot there...",2
5,"This is my favorite ramen spot I've found to date. I'm a big ramen fan and I travel a lot for work so I'm always trying to scope out new ramen places in different cities. Cheu is the standard I use to compare all new spots against. The wait is rough but well worth it. We've usually put our name in, headed to a bar for a bit, then come back. While I've tried several of my friends' bowls, I can't help ordering the miso ramen every time. Their broth is really something special and the pork belly melts in  your mouth. Definitely a don't miss if you're a ramen fan in the Philly area.",2
4,"Maybe my favorite location to visit at least once a week, especially when on this side of town. Their selection is random but unlike most other locations this one usually have items in my size especially shoes and sometimes hats but most of all its all about the ""Selections"" that draw me here. So I suggest you make a stop if you have the time. One thing I learned about shopping at Ross, if you see something you like buy it. Don't wait, because it may not be there next time.",2
4,"Fantastic breakfast spot.  I went on two occasions and varying degrees of service both times, but both times, the food was excellent.  The first time, the line was 10 deep, and growing mostly because the counter girl was slower than molasses to enter in a order.  It might have been because she kept screwing it up:My rib eye steak and eggs some how turned into ham steak and eggs.... the hashbrowns are excellent here but when we went back on Sunday, they weren't serving hash browns, only grits.... I opted for biscuits and eggs which were fantastic as well...  Great breakfast to grease you up after a night of drinking or you just want a well grilled meal. Best practice, walk in to the back counter, order your meal and then grab a seat - no wait staff.  They offer up great bloody mary's for those in need a little hair of the dog.I say some of the talent that walked in and out of here were better than the bar scene and much funner to talk to.  Unfortunately the busers take advantage of this also and the tables suffer with plenty of dirty dishes waiting to be taken care of... even when still when your food comes out... Go and enjoy.",2
4,"The service was warm and friendly, but not overly cloying. Food wasn't spectacular,  but it was good, a step up from typical pub food. It was satisfying. The atmosphere is very nice, upscale, comfortable and yet stylish.",2
5,Always busy but always worth the wait! Food is always fantastic! The servers are unique and friendly. Everything is fresh and perfect.,2
3,"I went to this Schnucks last night for the first time. I was impressed. Everything looked fresh and clean. The store was big and had more items than a regular Schnucks. The one thing that did bother me was I was overcharged for 2 different items. I did point this out and was given back the money but when I asked that they change it in their computer for others, I was told that ""someone else does that"". I think I will skip this Schnucks in the future.",1
3,"We wanted to be impressed, but we just weren't. Seemed stuffy from the start. While checking in the 2 young girls spent an awkward amount of time finding our reservation. No ""We're glad you chose to dine with us"" or even a simple ""Good evening."" The food was good, not great-we had the lobster Mac appetizer, 2 entrees (it's extra for any veggie sides) and a glass of wine and a beer-$180. It just didn't seem worth it.",1
5,"We belong to lifetime in another state and were visitingvisiting from Colorado to buy a potential second-home in the area. First Jen The front desk person was so nice and very helpful.   She speaks so highly of the club and all of the amenities that it offers.    I also met Joe the general manager what a terrific guy.     The club is much smaller than other lifetimes however very full service for those who want The next level and service.    The bathrooms are fantastic and for the men fully stocked with shavers, shaving cream and lotions.   You need absolutely no toiletries all provided.  Great location next to the mall.  Highly recommend.",2
1,"Inattentive and confused waiters could have been either inexperienced or under staffed. Bring SPF 45 sunblock in case you seated near the neon sign. Food was par. Bring crayons, tables are covered in paper. Bottom line: tonight was my first and last experience at st. Tropez.",0
4,I thought the food was good.  It's the average Mexican restaurant in Nashville.  They have about the same menu as anywhere else and they don't try to be something they're not.  It's a small building and has a weird layout but I could care less about that.  There are probably cheaper places but this is convenient for me because of location.  I didn't drink but I saw a few drink specials that I'll definitely check out in the future.,2
2,"High hopes.. Big let down. Let's start with service. Once seated we waited considerably longer then expected for our server. She was pleasant but admittedly running ""very behind"". The menu was delightful and the items sounded delicious. I ordered the chicken fried steak. My wife had the tacos. She said they were fine, but she is not into food like I am. Then again how do you mess up tacos? Although, she did admit the filling was far too wet and caused the corn tortilla to fall apart. She was not unhappy and enjoyed her meal. Now on to my dish, the Chicken Fried Steak. Great idea poor delivery. The steak was an oily mess, the English muffin was cold and very obviously not toasted correctly. The scrambled eggs seemed out of a carton. I served in the Navy, and these eggs must have been manufactured at the same place. Now my biggest let down of the meal... The massively hyped potatos.. they were so awful. If I had to guess these were out of a bag and deep fried. At least half tasted like they had sat under a warming light to the point of fossilizing.  They were hard dry and way to salty.. The check came in at roughly 60 bucks. Not worth the money. Totaly missed the mark.",0
5,"This fun, friendly new taproom and bottle shop has an amazing selection of craft beer along with elevated street food prepared by the long time Santa Barbara chef, Norbert Schulz. In addition to the delicious menu and great selection of beer on tap there is a walk in cooler with tons of bottles to choose from. The bartenders are knowledgeable and friendly. Wine and drinks for the kids are also available. The interior is spacious and the patio is delightful. What a great addition to the Funk Zone.",2
3,"Delicious crab cakes, both the appetizer and the sandwich! Happy hour until 6:30 means all appetizers are just $6, so I couldn't pass them up! Bar staff were friendly, and kept my glasses full.",1
5,"Erzulie's is one of the most beautiful shops in the French Quarter. Their inventory is artistically displayed, and they have actual voudou altars in the store. The staff are so helpful and they also offer readings if you need more specific advice. Anna will blow your mind with her accuracy and insight into your personal situations! I love the handmade soaps, the high quality essential oils, and the lovely ritual items. Anna and her staff are always willing to answer questions, not just about their products, but also about voudou traditions and the French Quarter. They are featured on many of the voudou tours as well. You must visit Erzulie's while in the French Quarter!",2
3,"I really love Chipotle so there is no complaints about food here.  I come here a lot and half of the staff is really great, just super cool and super friendly and the other half just doesn't really even pay attention while they're making your food. I'd hate to give this place a bad review just based on those people but it is true that a team is only as strong as its weakest link.  Sometimes when I come in it is only the friendly staff members and it is really a great experience.   I mostly come to this specific Chipotle because the location is convenient but when there is one of the fun, friendly staff members taking my order it is just an added bonus.",1
4,"Crisp vegetables spring rolls and a sweet savoury pad thai with well executed noodles. Good predictable Thai meal.Because I learned they allow BYOB, I brought over some beers from the Giant in the same shopping strip.I ordered the vegetable spring rolls and shrimp pad thai.The spring rolls come out hot out of the fryer. They are sliced at an angle, which allows more of the aroma of the filling to waft up to one's nose.The crust was pleasantly golden, both slightly oily and crisp. The interior of the roll was slightly mushy (not quite perfect.) But the mix of vegetables was savoury and generous in portion.The accompanying sweet and sour dipping sauce added a needed element of acid to an otherwise very umami forward flavor profile.The Shrimp Pad Thai was portioned very generously. The noodles were well executed, firm yet soft on the bite. The dish had a powerful flavor blend of fishiness, savouriness, and sweet. The nuts inside were just crunchy enough to add an interesting mouthfeel. The shrimp was slightly over cooked and presented a noticeable but subtle mushiness. Overall the dish was filling and more interesting in flavor than in texture, which was quite homogeneous. The noodles really did an excellent job absorbing the pad thai sauce.",2
3,"I fell in love with Silver Mine the moment my freshman taste buds came in contact with their freshly baked bread and perfect blend of herbs.My favorite sandwich is the Dodge City, a salami, pepperoni, provolone sandwich that leaves you feeling as greasy as if you had just sprayed yourself with a thin mist of vasoline, but most everything on the menu will leave you without the ability to control your eating speed.Is Silver Mine the best sandwich joint in Tucson?  No, that's reserved for East Coast Super Subs at twice the price.  But Silver Mine comes in at number 2.  A less expensive, almost as tasty option.",1
4,"I personally prefer a clean broth without too much spices or herbs so it's hard for me to find the right pho.  I tried about 5 other places before stumbled upon this one 3 months ago.  Wanted to try several times before writing a review since consistency is important. Their broth is awesome. Enough flavors to keep digging in, tender meats, fresh munk beans, basil and not so quick yet efficient service. I also tried their charbroiled pork (#44) and it's really good. Just right. I wish the place is a tad cleaner, hence 4 stars, rather than 5. Overalls, it is a great place if you're in the mood for pho.",2
2,I really liked this place for a long time when its was Steve's. Towards the end of Steve's I noticed a decline in food and service and it has continued on with the new management. I've been there three times since the re-naming and my order has never been right. One time I order over easy eggs and scrambled came out. The next time I ordered corned beef hash and sausage patties came out and the final time I ordered a 2 eggs with corned beef hash and home fries with tortillas. I got eggs with country fried steak and biscuits. By the time my order was replaced everyone at my table had finished there breakfast and had mediocre responses to the quality food. I'm not one to complain at restaurants but I will not be visiting what used to be my favorite neighborhood breakfast joint anymore.,0
5,"We tried Zorba's for the first time last weekend, and it was absolutely perfect. It's a charming little spot with AMAZING food. Having tried several greek places in the area, this is my most definitely my favorite. Loved the fact that it's BYOB! We began with the spicy feta dip (the cold one, not the hot one!) and it was very flavorful. An awesome portion for the price. I had the Artichokes Constantinople as my entrée, and it was FAB. The sauce was tangy, salty, and so satisfying. I can't wait to go back and get them again.My fiancé had some type of meat dish, I really can't remember what- but he loved it. Everything was tender and cooked to perfection. Also, the service was great, friendly, and fast.I can't wait to go back ASAP!",2
3,"This place has potential but feels so disorganized. A few months ago, I bought a Groupon for classes here. I called with some questions and left a message, but no one ever got back to me. The Groupon voucher said it was good for specialty or regular classes. I went on a Sunday and was told it wasn't good for Sunday classes because they are drop-in classes. Not sure how I could have known this since the voucher didn't say Sunday classes were excluded... The Groupon was expiring soon and so I really wanted to redeem the voucher, and they finally agreed to let me use it for that day. Last night I signed up and paid for zumba class this morning and dragged myself out of bed only to discover the class was cancelled because they have special workshops today. I've been assured I'll get a refund, but come on - the class should have been cancelled in the system! On the other hand...the classes are a lot of fun. I've mainly attended Peter's zumba class and love it! He is so upbeat and energetic - his class is a great way to start off my Saturday morning. I've also attended a class called Pound that uses special drumsticks, and it was a lot of fun. The prices are very reasonable as well. If you decide to go, be sure to bring your own water - oddly enough there isn't a water fountain, at least not that I've seen.",1
3,"Three and a half stars. You had me at ""hockey bar"" but lost me at ""Flyers."" Totally bizarre for me to be drinking in enemy territory, but a good time was had... even on a non-Quizzo night. Attentive service for everyone while we chatted up our fellow barmates. Our bartender recommended the Washington Apple shots, which were not too sweet and an alright break from our beers. Extra kudos to her for trying to be my buddy's wingman after she misread the situation.Bartender: ""So what brings you into town?""Me, turning to pat my friend on back: ""It's my buddy's birthday this week.""Bartender: ""Ohhhh."" And unbeknownst to me, shoves her finger into her other hand's thumb/index ring in the international sign of getting it on.Friend, shaking his head in response to her: ""No, no.""Me, slightly annoyed and still looking at my friend: ""Uh, yes... that's why I came up here!""Bartender, winking: ""Better let her have what she wants!""Me: ""Haha! Wait, what?""Friend: ""Oh god, I'll explain later...""Yeah, I see myself being a regular here if I lived nearby, even with last decade's buttrock constantly cycling through the jukebox. Laid back and friendly atmosphere, and much less crowded than Johnny Brenda's.",1
4,"A-List. This place is busy and for a few good reasons. The food is excellent. The $6 a glass house red was also excellent. Their bread pudding is the best I have ever experienced. The service was solid and a bit hurried as mentioned in some of the posts. There are a lot of out-of-towners here to be sure. What makes this place special are the locals who I spoke with at the restaurant who drove in to wait in line to eat here. That tells me things are pretty good at Mr. B's. Yes, it is expen$$$ive. Glad to have visited this place.",2
5,"Simply a great place to get your hair cut. The guys do a really good job because they care about their craft. I've been there twice in the past few months, and this will now be my only barber shop. Paul, Tim, and Josh are personable and talented guys who are easy to talk to and the service isn't expensive. Awesome.",2
1,Service was...wait what service?! We were disregarded for 15 minutes after asking for service. While the quality and atmosphere may have been wonderful the service was an absolute disappointment. Save your money for those that appreciate your patronage.,0
3,"My husband and I have been here a number of times and the food is typical beach eatery  I always enjoyed the food. Today , however ,the  platter I ordered was pretty bad. Crab cake , not much crab was lukewarm and mushy, scallops undercooked and fish overlooked and dry. Nothing was hot.  Not going back anytime soonServer was very nice though.",1
4,"Decided to try the Mexican restaurant based on reviews from yelp.  It is a small restaurant that is what I call a hole-in-wall.  The chip and salsa was very good, (need to ask for a bowl of salsa)  I had the fajitas and the were good, but not great.   Service was good and people were nice and helpful.  From out of town (calif) and would come again",2
5,"MmmmmmMmmm. You can find a philly cheesesteak at almost every corner in the city but it's nearly impossible to find a place that sells really good italian sausage sandwiches and italian roast beef.  George's Sandwich Shop is located right in the Italian Market area. Order an italian sausage sandwich and you have a choice of sweet, hot, or *burn my ass* peppers..  The sandwiches here are enormous and very satisfying.  They also have tripe sandwiches, hot dogs, crab cake sandwiches. Funny quote discovered here: ""Don't divorce your wife if she can't cook...eat here and keep her as a pet."" :)",2
4,"The doughnuts were decent but the doughnut holes were ridiculously delicious.  They were like fluffy doughnut pillows that melt in your mouth.  Not to mention, the place is super cheap.  We got six doughnuts, a dozen doughnut holes, and three milks for under ten bucks.It's not a cool hang out joint, the place is really dated, but don't let that keep you from trying the crazy good doughnut holes!",2
5,"Terry, I wanted to take this opportunity to thank you so much, not only for the expert craftsmanship but your patience with us through this process.  You were so incredibly receptive to any question or concern we had, ready to reel us in when needed.  I know, at times, things got a little rough with TS Colin, but you helped us keep our cool.  We could not be happier with the way our floors turned out.  We just cannot say enough and how much they exceeding our expectations.  Thank you to John and his crew.  You guys are THE BEST.",2
1,"I've never had to write a review based on horrendous service/hospitality alone, but I've also never felt so humiliated as I did when I visited Wings Over Broadway for the first time the other night.I was really looking forward to trying this place since people rave about how good the wings are and the great Tuesday night specials. I was coming from work so I arrived a few minutes after my party. The restaurant was half-empty when I arrived and there was no one waiting in line, so I went to my friends' table where their food had just arrived. That's when I was informed by the waitress that I couldn't sit down.The manager came over and explained the policy of ""no add-ons"" to a table, and the waitress offered me one of the (many) empty tables, where I would be ""allowed"" to sit BY MYSELF, as if I was some kind of pariah. My friends were aghast and we explained that we'd never been to Wings before, and they would never have invited me if they'd known I wouldn't be allowed to join them.I said I understood the policy for busy nights, and in the future we'd certainly abide by it, but since there was no one waiting for a table it couldn't hurt for me to sit down.Then the owner came over and very rudely said, ""Fine, you can sit down. But you have to pay full price for wings, no special for you."" He and the manager were glaring at me, totally unsympathetic. I've never felt so insulted, and never before experienced this sort of treatment from a restaurant. It pretty much ruined my day.To the owner of Wings: I was the nicely-dressed young lady that you turned away, and I'll be telling everyone I know how you made me feel and to avoid your establishment in the future.",0
5,This is the place we have been searching for! My friend and I have tried several nail salons in Tampa and nobody could do designs and stuff like how we wanted so we found this place on Instagram and we will never go anywhere else again! We drive almost an hour to get here but it is so worth it! I have had 2 different people who both did exactly what I wanted and are extremely talented! Thank you Pamela and Steven! You all do amazing work!!!,2

1,"To give some context, my fiance lives 1000 miles away and any gift or thoughtful gesture means a lot.1. The delivery man was too lazy to look for an actual main entrance to my apartment, so he called me (ruined the surprise of flowers). I had to direct him to the entrance and then he unprofessionally started talking about how hard it was to find the entrance. It is a large, elaborate entrance, so my guess is he didn't look too hard.2. I picked up my flowers from the front office from the spot which the delivery man left them and they look horrible. The roses and carnations are wilted, the calla lilies are folded. The arrangement has no shape and looks weedy. It looks as if the basket and flowers were smashed up against something. 3. The basket the flowers came in is broken on the bottom. 4. The note from my fiance is printed poorly as if the printer was running out of ink. I keep these notes because we live at a distance now. The overall quality of this order is disheartening!I live in a luxury community and I'm sure no one in the office caused this damage to the flowers. It was embarrassing picking up something from the leasing office that looked the way this arrangement did.Our wedding is in April 2016 and we're looking for a florist. I definitely wouldn't choose this company!",0
2,"Had dinner here on a recent Friday evening.  Glad we had reservations (for 5) as they were packed tight, have learned this is to be expected in a new Tampa restaurant. Excellent and very attentive service could not make up for the so-so food.  We ordered several appetizers to share - queso fundito and flautas de pollo.  Queso was tasty but nearly impossible to tackle and remove to a chip once the skillet dish cooled off.  2 flautas for $8 served on a large plate, fancy dressed but not impressive for taste.  I had carne asada iron skillet tacos, served with mini corn tortillas which were so soft they fell apart when I tried to load them.  Finally went to the beef (??) with a knife and fork as it was quite tough and lacked any real flavor.  The accompanying sauces were quite good.  For me, the best by far was the delightful passion fruit tea - served in a tequila bottle.Besito is high on atmosphere, gimmick and price.  Maybe Tampa will support this location past the new-restaurant-frenzy phase.  For the price, there are too many other local options for me to hurry back here.",0
5,Delicious ice cream with topping. Fudge and raspberry toppings are great. We'll definitely come back here in the future. There are still a lot of things to try. They only don't have espresso coffee.,2
3,Stopped in on way down 611 to the Tpk. Thought I would try it out. Very happy with my burger and especially liked the roll. A bit less $ than 5Guys so that is a plus. Agree 5G has better fries but this is in a key spot for me so will be visiting again to try a hot dog!,1
1,"I would really like to try this place but every time I show up they are unexpectedly closed! The first time I showed up I was told they were closed for a Spring Spruce up and would be open on the 11th. I left a little annoyed because there was no indication of this on their website, which I had used to look them up and browse the menu. I later discovered they had something up on their Facebook page about being closed, but seeing as those I don't have a Facebook, this was of no benefit to me. Today (March 15th) I drove all the way over only to discover a sign on the door stating they will be closed the remainder of the week! This time I checked their Facebook and there was no information regarding the extended closure. In fact it was a bit confusing because they had posts advertising the re-opening and even pictures posted of people eating there for a brunch event just the other day. Is this some kind of secret society of delicious eatery? I really wish I knew. Poor communication on the businesses side of things has made me feel like I probably won't be giving these guys a try. If I do muster up the fortitude to drive clear across town again I will definitely be calling ahead to make sure they are open. I suggest you do the same.",0
5,The food was excellent. The service was excellent. The atmosphere was excellent. This is just what downtown needs to transform the area. Great farm to table food that tastes great. I got the short rib and an old fashion and it was terrific. Will definitely come back again.,2
5,"Love, love, love Ron's! Been going here for years! The Ham & Cheese Oval is the best! Not to mention their french fries are just out of this world! Cheese Steak Wrap is always great! The only problem I've ever had at Ron's was a chicken salad wrap that I asked for with no onions..and it was fixed immediately! Great food, great service!",2
4,"This place makes a good cup of coffee but you already new that. I came here once on a date that ended up being late so i ordered a cup of joe and played a game of chess with a man named Grey (I'm pretty sure he's the checker at Vons) long story short, i lost the game and the girl so i knocked off a star",2
3,"Ordinarily I like taking my car to Pep Boys as I find their prices are considerably less than the dealers.  However, the service was a bit slow even though there weren't that many people waiting for service.  They were pretty thorough and did identify some problems with my vehicle that I'm sure I'll have them fix later.",1

4,"On a street littered with restaurants, this little Gastro is a nice spot to grab some drinks and maybe a bite to eat. A decent sized bar is the center of attention and it extends outside with a few spots to sit. Half of the seating is outside on the sidewalk. The dinner menu is small but has some interesting dishes. We tried the corn chowder that had a little warm crab salad. Taste was good and it hit the spot with a little bread on the one cold and windy night we were there. The Roasted Duck breast had some crunchy skin and was nicely cooked. It came with sauteed spinach and steamed wild rice, all in one small pile. The Pan seared scallops were cut in half (4 halves) and served ontop of corn and poblano relish with a little bacon scattered around. Both of the appetizer plates were very small for the $14 price point. Apps and entrees ranged from $12 to $35. We also tried the Peach Cobbler and Chunky Monkey cheesecakes, whcih were very good. They also have beer, wine, and specialty drink menus which we didn't get into much. We thought we would save that for another trip! Service was excellent and should be on a Monday night. Overall, a great experience.",2
2,"Beautiful lobby, average rooms.  Staff up front are very nice (as mentioned in previous reviews), but they don't have enough staff to keep rooms up.  Not enough space in bathroom to hang up towels and cleaning staff don't get around until 3 or after.",0
5,"Today was my first time at Heads and Tails. As soon as I met Jenne, we hit it off and had so many things to talk about within seconds. She did an amazing job on my eyebrows and throughly explained the process and after care product she used. I really appreciated the time she took to check my eyebrows after being waxed and asked my opinion on if I saw anything I wanted fixed.  Already have my next appointment scheduled!",2
4,"Pags rules this street with three separate venues: a pizza place, a fancier Italian restaurant, and the super-romantic wine bar we love.  The front room looks like an old time train station waiting area, with its dramatic hanging lights, banquettes, and tiny tables (AND the Bridgette Bardot poster).  The wine menu is heavily French and not cheap, so savor those glasses, but they will give you a taste before you invest.  For example, they had a Veuve Cliquot Yellow Label open to try by the glass ($13, and a full bottle was $84).   Most wine places don't have such an expensive bottle available for glasses.The last time we went, we were in the mood for rosé, having just accomplished one of life's milestones.  Due to excellent recommendations from the owner, we developed a major crush on Pommery champagne, which they had as splits in two different versions, pink and blue.  Oh, such a cute half-size wine bucket too.There is a full bar, not just wine, and sometimes they bring out free tapas such as kalamata olives (plus a little dish for the pits, nice touch).  We have enjoyed the arugula pizza back in our ovo-lacto days, but you don't come here for the food.  The building is long and narrow, so the back part is even darker and more intimate, if you need to hide out, and there is a tiny patio in front though I have never seen anyone on it.Music can be anything from classic jazz to electronica, and I don't remember any tvs, hurray.  Recently, Nina Simone was playing, just perfect for our mood.  My bf got into a discussion about Indian and Brazilian music with the owner, who then played some recommended Brazilian artists from his own collection for us and wrote down the names so we could hunt them down later.  (Interlibrary loan + iPod = amazingly broad and deep music collection, ssssh.)",2
5,Best coffee in town in  broadripple across from Monkeys TaleFriendly servers,2
5,"Nice merchandising in the lobby.  Fantastic breakfast for the morning after brewery crawls. They had trouble with the taps when we went, but made up for it in heavy pours. The beer selection makes flights a little hard to choose from, so go more than once to work through the brews. You won't be sorry.",2
3,Very good chicken. The baked beans were not sweet enough for me though. Garlic fries were good. Service was pleasant and didn't hover. I appreciate that. Very good chicken joint,1
5,This is easily one of my favorite spots in Reno. The food is always fresh tasting and the blend of spices even on the salad and vegetables is superb. A must try.,2
4,"I went to Revolucion last night for the first time, but only for drinks.  I'll update my review when I have a chance to go there for food.  It has a fun, colorful atmosphere inside.  You can spend several minutes just checking out the arrangements of Mexican wrestling masks, action figures, and sombreros of many colors, along with the bold artwork.  I had the chili margarita, which was pretty much a regular margarita with chili powder on the rim and a thai red chili floating in the drink.  Only $5.50, which isn't bad.  The taste was different, but good.  (I did wake up with terrible heartburn in the early hours of the morning, but that may have been unrelated ;) The menu looked quite tasty, and I can't wait to go back to try the tacos  I also hear the beer selection is good.  If they are as good as I imagine, it may raise my rating to a 5 next time!",2
5,The atmosphere was great! We had amazing service by the server Killian and the food was so good! Excited to return soon!,2
3,Pizza is good but extremely loud atmosphere on the weekends. Last time I was there I felt like I was at the zoo.,1
5,"AMAZING folks here and selection! Great customer service and help from 1,000 miles away, Ruby was great! I was missing a very important family birthday in New Orleans and needed a bottle of Champagne sent to the room. The hotel didn't offer that and after lot of searching i stumbled upon Vieux Carre and they were able to delivery the bottle of champagne I wanted (at a great price!) and actual champagne flutes for me!  I will def use them again",2
5,"To the reviewer who said 'best Carne Asada burrito ever', absolutely agree! It's yummy, and huge. The Carne Asada in general is excellent at this restaurant. Their shrimp is excellent and their tacos are good. Honestly I haven't had anything here that I didn't like. The food is really good and very authentic Mexican. Before taking your order they bring you chips and salsa. The chips are authentic themselves, which means they're not all salty as you would expect American chips to be. But you don't need them salty when there's salsa, plus they bring you limes which are an excellent addition if you squeeze them over the chips. The staff is very friendly and helpful but not in your face as at some restaurants. The building is nice, and it's a really pleasant atmosphere. Plus the food doesn't take very long to come.It's definitely not a fancy restaurant, so if you're looking for someplace for a special occasion you might want to look elsewhere. But it's clean, neat and extremely relaxing inside. So if you're looking for good Mexican food, this is definitely the place to go!",2
1,"Could not get service. I was pass over service twice for customers that ordered was taken immediately after being seated. When I bought to the hostess, that I was at lunch and was pass over. She told that I would have to wait because they was busy.",0
3,"Good food, loud atmosphere, great service by Ben. They were out of Bread Pudding, which was a big disappointment. The Alfredo was a bit overdone, nothing really outstanding about the food. Had it not been for the great service I'd have only given them one star.",1
2,I wanted to like Izumi but didn't. The host/waiter certainly was accommodating so service was not the issue. For the price I found the portion size to be very small.  When paying $13 for a roll I expect it to be much more hearty in size than an appetizer type roll that is more like a side dish than an entree.  The sea weed salad was nasty - although I felt like the waiter prepared us for the - others must have complained. The ginger chicken took a long time to cook but I am not sure why as when it came out it was still pink.  The flavor was ok but for $21 I would have expected to get more than an appetizer size portion of chicken. It was accompanied by a risotto which was flavored as salt. The saltiness was so overpowering that you couldn't taste anything else.  As someone who lived in Japan for four years and studied the language and culture for eleven I was underwhelmed by izumi.,0
3,"This is as close to Japanese cuisine I get! I'm not a big fan of sushi, sashimi or maki, but I really enjoy their rice bowls and tempura. This location is not terribly busy so you won't have to wait in line for too long. They also provide catering options so you can have sushi and maki platters at your functions.The service has always been good, for fast food. And I know I can keep somewhat on my eating plan when I go here. It's a fast lunch or dinner if you're in a hurry to.",1
5,"The service here is pretty fast, seemingly even on at prime dinner time of 8pm. The portions for the main course that I got seemed small - but if you get an appetizer either to share or on your own, an average person should be in good shape. For the table we got an order of the Truffle Rosemary Parmesan French Fries, which were very flavorful. It had a nice earthy truffle taste, balanced with the saltiness of the Parmesan, and rounded out with the rosemary. Main course was the Bacon Wrapped shrimp with Stone ground Grits. This was exceptional - and was probably the best 'shrimp n' grits' i've had in NOLA. Shrimp was perfectly cooked, with a crisp piece of bacon wrapped around it. It stayed crispy even on top of the moist, decadent, and flavorful cheese grits.",2
5,Great breakfast place - got the Benedict and substituted out the bacon for avocado. Flavor was on point. Will Probably swapped out toast for English muffin.,2
4,"This restaurant is in a great location near my apartment and I have ordered from them multiple times.  The fried egg rolls are delicious by my favorite dish is the shrimp pho.  The staff are friendly, the food is delicious and the atmosphere is nice.  My only suggestion is to work on a website because the website on the front of the door is no longer in use. Otherwise, this will remain one of my restaurants in rotation.",2
5,"We had such a good time! Marcus was so fun as ax master. 8 gets you your own lane and you get a picnic table so you can order food, they don't sell any there. You can buy soda or water for $1.",2
5,We've been here many times - both take out and eat in. The food and service is always excellent! Brought my parents for dinner once and the staff was very helpful and friendly with explaining the food and helping them find something they'd like even though they weren't familiar with the cuisine. The take out is always ready on time and packaged thoughtfully. This is for sure our go to Indian! We drive from Lebanon for it!,2
5,"Our office went today for Friday's happy hour special.  Such a great deal, and it wasn't packed.  Didn't expect it, but the food and drinks on their specials-amazing!  Usually the happy hour offerings wouldn't be. Definitely try the pork sliders and the beignets for dessert.  Really fun time and great atmosphere.Staff was very friendly too!",2
5,Great experience.I reserved online one hour prior to checking the bike out. The bike was in good shape and exceeded my expectation. Will return in the future.,2
4,"We came with the family for a late lunch. Kids each had a kid's meal; adults each had a pizza. We had an order of bread sticks as well. Service was friendly, but it took a long time for our food to come, despite the short cooking time of the pizza in the fire. Kid portions are small, but I have kids on the older side of kid menu appropriateness. Adult pizzas were spectacular. I had the wild mushroom (with added bacon). Other adult was a different veggie Pizza, also very good. Kids described the pepperoni as just right in spiciness, with a nice crispiness.  All in all, we enjoyed it and will return. Just make sure you have enough time in your schedule if you go.",2
5,"I was lucky enough to spend 2 weeks in Boise for ""work."" Spent my free time drinking my way around Boise's great craft beer scene. I visited about 10 breweries or brewpubs and Payette was far and away my fav. Tons of beers on tap. I would guess probably 30. Fun custom 4 beer flights, and cheap too! Like hard to believe cheap. Beautiful building and space. No food, but on both of my visits they had a food truck parked outside. Great vibe. Oh yeah, and most importantly, the beer is excellent!",2
2,"The shrimp po boy was completely off on proportions. The bread was super thick, hard and chewy and I threw away half of it because who can possibly eat that much bread in one meal. The shrimp was good but skimpy portions. The creole sauce is  good too. I would not get it again.",0
4,"Went there with 3 other people. Two got the ahi tuna tostada, one got shrimp and brussel sprouts, and I got the releno natural. The ahi tuna was done just right, the shrimp was huge & with homemade red sauce, and chile releno was very tasty.",2
4,"This place has solid veggie and vegan options in the sushi.It doesn't say one way or another on the menu, but if you're wondering, the giant veggie roll thing has no tamago in it, so vegans, enjoy!Obviously, the avocado, cucumber, asparagus, and such are also fine. I ate so much sushi that I forget what exactly they had.",2
3,"You can't escape the coffee smell that pours into the Ybor streets even from blocks away. At first my zombie-self-craving coffee wondered why the building was so huge, when upon entering all I could see was a small shop with a couple cafe tables. INTERESTINGBut through the glass behind the barista was a flurry of activity. They roast and package the coffee in that building! (that explains the size and smell of the place) Plus, wander into a small side room to view little coffee-related gifts.SERVICEEh... brisk and  business-like. No smiles yet hardworking. Eh... maybe they need some of their own coffee.TASTEIs it the barista or the coffee? The coffees' tastes were watered down and no amount of ""con leche"" could save it.",1
5,Aldo's has awesome pizza! It was our first time in the area. We drove here for a soccer tournament. My boy's are picky eaters and they loved the pizza. They finished a large pizza amongst the two of them! The ambiance is very nice with Italian music playing and it's clean and the staff is friendly! What a great find!,2
5,"I have been getting waxed here for years and have been satisfied with the services. The staff is cordial and professional. Today, however, was something different. Tyisha is a gifted aesthetician. She is thorough and careful. The wax was the perfect temperature and the removal painless. This woman is a revelation. I had a new spring in my step walking out today! I'll never go to anyone else. Thank you Tyisha!",2
5,"Some recent improvements in the practice:  new digs @ 8th & Walnut, walk in hours, and u can make appointments on-line. There were some recent communication problems between the office & my RiteAid pharmacy.  I finally asked for written Rx for all my meds, hand carried them to the pharmacist @23rd & Walnut.  Got 3 month supplies of most,w only a small copay.  That worked. The practice has (finally) gone totally electronic with patient records. Dr Nizen is a first-rate diagnostician. She listens extremely well.  I'm still very satisfied.",2
3,I've only had the wings here but they're pretty good. I just get the house sauce with garlic cheese fries on the side. Great late night spot but I often call before making the trip just to ensure they're open.,1
5,Dinner was absolutely delicious. Everything is fresh and made in an open kitchen. Had the salmon and it was so tasty! Definitely worth the wait!,2
1,"Very bad service and i took one month for rent, so they charged different types of taxes and extra fees. Finally they charge for tolls but all the tolls i only paid I didn't use ezpass. Budget is the worst rental service and i took car from different place",0
4,"Yes, it's star spotting sensation and the pancakes and bacon are fabulous, but go without the kiddies.  Your kids won't like the wait - heck, I'm a grown up and I don't like the wait - and once they get to their seats they will be treated to the oh-so-unspecial treat of having no booster seats but old boxes of sugar to sit on (??).  Can you say 'owner without children'? Alas, if you are going on a weekday early-ish, it's a darn good eatin' joint.  I've never had an order that was slow or anything less than what I expected.  It's worth the extra money - the wait is up to you to decide.",2
4,"This was my first visit to a Giordano's outside of the Chicago area and it was the same experience you get in Chicago! There's no higher praise I can offer. The decor is industrial. Service was great.We went on a Friday night after a movie downtown. It was mostly, but not entirely full. We were seated quickly and ordered right away since the stuffed pizzas take 40 minutes.We had a BBQ Chicken pizza and a sausage pepperoni pizza, both small deep dish pizzas. They were great! They offer sandwiches, pasta, and salad in addition to the famous pizzas.",2
3,"This place has a great location for the hungry tourist. It manages to be edgy yet chill at the same time. My reason for stopping in was to try the ahi fish tacos with avocado relish, which sounded awesome. At around 3 there was still a healthy amount of people attesting to its popularity and eatability. They had a selection of local microbrews (bottle, not draft) for those interested in getting a taste of Philly in beer form. Alas, I ordered my tacos, but had a little Scooby Doo moment when the arrived. Somehow the chef decided that it was okay to put such a delicate fish in premade taco shells...enough to makes this SoCal girl wince a little and question whether I should consume. Luckily the flavor of the fish was great. I only saw one half inch cube of avocado, but at least the sauce was yummy! I got a glimpse of the brunch menu...looks pretty tasty I must say...",1
5,I met up with a group of co workers for a couple of beers and ended up finding a gem of a place! Amazing beer selection and the food menu looked delicious. (I'll be back for food next time!) the staff was extremely friendly and attentive. I thought that being in Seminole Heights parking would've been an issue but there's a huge lot across the street designated for parking for their place. I only wish I lived closer or maybe they can open another location closer to Sarasota?! (Wishful thinking),2
1,"Definitely not what it used to be when it was ""Christine's twisty treat"". There's sofas outside and it's an eyesore! I also went there before for a strawberry banana smoothie and the girl working said she didn't know how to make it bc she wasn't trained.",0
5,Ordered the gator bites and creole potatoes. Was told to wait and 15 minutes later I got my plate. The gator was just so tasty and the creole potatoes were awesome too. Have to add that their BBQ Sauce was really delicious. Reading all the bad reviews really makes me wonder if I was at the same place. The service was more than friendly and I left a happy person. 5 stars for some really good food!,2
5,"We had some great concrete's here this past Saturday.  My favorite is Vanilla with Reese's Peanut Butter Cups.  It makes me hungry just thinking about it. :)  My wife likes the chocolate custard with oreo's.  I've honestly never had anything here that wasn't good.  They have a sundae that has devil's food cake, custard, and hot fudge.  It is dynamite!  I'm always amazed at how busy this place is, even when it's cold and raining.  The staff does a great job of getting through the lines in a hurry.  Even if the line looks long, there's never a long wait.  I just wish it would have been nice enough for my wife and I to sit outside and eat.  It was too cold so we ate it in the car.  This is a St. Louis landmark, so if you've never been, it's definitely worth trying.  We try to come here several times a year, and it makes a great spot for dessert if you eat dinner at Trattoria Marcella.",2
1,"Not a fan. Sorry. I'm clearly in the minority here. I had the Chicken Platter, which ended up being a flattened, breaded, fried chicken cutlet. The sauce drizzled on top was syrupy and sweet but not in a good way. All I could taste was grease and sweet. Again, I am obviously in the minority with my opinion, so maybe my taste buds are just broken, but I was not impressed.",0
5,"I really, really, really like Fred Meyer. Especially this one on Federal Way. 9.9 out 10 times a great experience. Love the ads, love the e-coupons, love the produce, love the meat department, love the cheese department, love the wine, affordable clothing, gifts, seasonal garden area, toys, playland, pharmacy, and the big sales... I really LOVE that just about every single time I've been here (and it's been A LOT) the customer service is excellent. I feel happy to be spending my money here. That means a lot.The pricing is very good if you watch the ads and use their coupons. I love the fuel discount too. The employees are usually in a pretty good mood - and you can feel it. Today my checker was Aaron - and he is AWESOME!Thank you for making it such a pleasant experience in this store. A thousand times - THANK YOU! :)Oh - thanks also for supporting the arts in our community!",2
5,"It's nice to see a lot more Vietnamese restaurants opening in the city especially uptown, you can never have too many options. Mint is located right next to Dat Dog, a pleasant new addition to the Freret scenery. It offers authentic Vietnamese dishes with savory, traditional flavors. You can find yourself a really good bowl of pho or plate of com ga roti (rice w/ rotisserie chicken) here. They even offer brown rice as a healthier alternative which I was really excited about! The menu also offers some items with a different flair such as the kim chi burger and chicken with green tea waffles, which I'll definitely be back to try. If you're really brave, you can try one of their specialty cocktails that contains fish sauce in the mix. I love how nicely the decor was done, from the chandeliers to the cute tea cups. There seems to be a good selection of wine which you can enjoy at their spacious bar counter if you're in need of some down time. I had a nice glass of Chardonnay and spring rolls (awesome sauce, literally!) while waiting for friends. The name was chosen well, as mint is one of the cooking staples in Vietnamese cuisine. Their friendly staff and atmosphere will definitely bring me back for frequent visits.",2
5,"Convenient location and foodcourt is a plus. However not too many good stores.  I mainly only stop by for Bath& Body Works. As far as the other retail store, I find the sales and selections limited.",2
2,"This place could have a lot of potential under the right management and with some renovations.  Unfortunately, this place feels as though it is one step away from going out of business.  The positive were the prices.  Decent prices.  The hotel does have some cool architecture but it has been neglected.  The place smells musty.  The rooms are nice though.It is kind of sad because I see a lot of potential in this place under some good management.  The overall negative was the staff.  Every single person we came into contact with was clueless. It feels like they are running on a skeleton staff. You are always waiting and waiting for someone to help you.  The wait-staff in all areas is slow and confuse. The only good waiter was Michael in the restaurant.  He is very nice and professional.  Ask for Michael if you are eating in.  The food was not very good either.  The burgers were overcooked and the calamari was greasy.  The steak was weird and rubbery, but the salmon was decent.  With the low prices brings a slightly wild crowd.  The pool gets a little wild on the weekends.  The spa could be nice, but the massage prices are way too high.  You can go just down the road for something just as good for half the price.  They charged $170 for an 80 minute massage.  That's about as high as it gets.  The massage was decent but you can find cheaper within walking distance.  Nancy gives a decent massage.  If I had extra money and time, I would buy this place and whip it into shape because I see so much potential.  Unfortunately, I would not go back unless it was under new management.  By the end of the trip, it was just too much.  The place was dirty and the staff was bad.  We should have stayed home.",0
5,"Chris is the best, he goes above and beyond for his customers. He treats both his customers and his employees with respect. He's very good at problem solving and keeping long term costumers",2
3,La Copa is a good store that carries soccer jerseys. Whether you are looking for international or Euro jersey's this is a pretty good spot.They also carry training clothes and soccer gear but it's best for jerseys. I found they didn't have to big of a selection and the most popular jerseys are always sold out here or not in stock. You'd probably have better luck at a place like Free Kick or even ordering online.,1
1,"Ordered take out from this place tonight. It was by far the worst meal I have ever had. I ordered the chicken parmesan. This is a pretty hard dish to screw up but they did a fine job of it. It was an unidentifiable piece of gray rubbery meat (I think). The breading was soggy and I needed a steak knife to cut the chicken. I literally could not chew it, it was so tough. The garlic bread it came with, was also disgusting! It was greasy and hard. Yuck! My husband had a sauted chicken campagniola with veggies which was marginally better. The chicken was so overdone, it made it hard to stomach. The food was so disgustingly greasy that the brown bag they gave us broke. Uggh!  If you get food from this place, be warned. Maybe stick with the pizza.",0
3,"In the same spot that Perfect Ten used to occupy, La Dolce Salon and Spa is clean, comfortable ... and a little sterile.  The staff were polite, I'm happy with my shellac pedicure, but I wasn't blown away by warmth or comfort.  Maybe if I was a regular, they'd be more friendly?  But I wasn't impressed enough to feel like I want to become a regular here.",1
5,We were in Indianapolis on a business trip for the week and found this place in yelp. BEST place in Indianapolis! We have strict dietary restrictions due to health reasons (crohns) so finding a place to eat out is always a bit of a challenge. This was the first place where we took nearly 20 min to decide what we wanted to eat! So many options for us AND the food was incredible! The paleo pizza crust made us not even miss regular pizza crust and the kombucha cocktails were so refreshing. Plus the service was top notch. Definitely coming back here when we are here for business again!,2
5,My favorite brunch spot in Tucson!!! Always the nicest servers and most unique food. I haven't found a brunch spot that balances sweet and savory like Prep. I have gotten the duck confit twice now which is saying something because before prep & pastry I had never tried duck before! Pro tip make sure you spring for a dossant it's well worth it.,2
4,"We've stayed here a few times over the years by virtue of having family in close proximity. The staff is invariably courteous but I have to confess that the place has seen better times. The carpets are beginning to get a bit ragged as is the furniture. On our most recent sojourn, the water would not drain from the bathtub - the lady in the reception was kind enough to find us another room but the room smelled strongly of frying oil (!)........ given that it was way past our bedtime, we chose to keep the room. Think the innkeepers need to up their game a bit here...",2
5,"Becky is a down-to-earth trainer who makes you feel comfortable within yourself and your capacity to train. She is very conscientious of your limitations and works around them to ensure you get a great session. She has a realistic approach based on science and not fad, which makes her training easy to follow without feeling like a failure. The best trainer in town for sure!",2
5,"There's not much better than Valentine's. We've been coming for years, but it has been several since we've been. We went last night, and it was as satisfying of an experience as ever before. It would've been my parents' 33rd anniversary, so we ordered a honorary Bloody Mary for my dad's seat. Between the three of us dining, we had two sirloins and a ribeye. Mom and I upgraded our salads to include their housemade bleu cheese dressing. SO worth it. Each steak was cooked spot on. Everything was delicious. Mom got the caramel cheesecake for dessert. Holy cow! That was one of the best desserts I've ever had, hands down. The waitress knew it would've been my parents anniversary, and she brought out two small chocolate desserts that they do in honor of anniversaries. Not only was it delicious, it was the sweetest gesture I've experienced at a restaurant. I wish I could give more stars!",2
1,"I've ordered pizza here twice because I am in the neighborhood. Both times have been awful. Today, the dough on my pizza was literally raw. I really want this place to suceed, but the pizza is not good.",0
3,"The pizza is great, the service is friendly. However, a large pizza here, which costs about 25$, is the size of a medium/small anywhere else. The toppings are good, but they definitely withheld the steak on the lobo pizza.",1
1,"Sat in the drive thru for 15 minutes, finally got to order, and the employee couldn't get our order right. He then has the nerve to yell at me through the speaker and tell me ""I'm busy doing 6 things at once, hold on!"" I have never felt so disrespected at a fast food joint. I immediately leave the drive thru to go in and let the manager on duty know how rude his employee was, and so we could finally order our food. (Let me remind you by this point we had been here 20 minutes and still haven't even ordered!) I talked with the manager, order our food, and it still took another 20 minutes to get it. I work in a restaurant, i know that it isn't as easy as people think. They weren't understaffed, they weren't busy, and that is why i am appalled at the lack of customer service and execution! 45 minutes for food and terrible customer service... Will not be coming back!",0
3,"If you are hankerin' for a big, cheesy Chicago-style deep dish pizza, go immediately to the Black Thorn. Their sauce is just slightly peppery/spicy, which I adore and they use mozzarella, not the ""provel"" gloop that is found atop many a St. Louis pizza. As a Wisconsin girl, born and bred, I cannot abide ""provel"". Dig?Add an ice-cold pitcher of beer and a few spirited games of air hockey and you have the perfect way to spend an evening with friends. If you want to do take out for dinner, order as close to opening time (5 pm) as possible. Otherwise the wait can be very long, especially as bar business picks up.Note: Those vehemently against eating anywhere there may be cigarette smoke in the air, you will want to avoid the Black Thorn as (1) it is a pub and (2) therefore, pretty smoky. [That has never kept me from going, but then again, I grew up with parents who chain-smoked Winstons when I was at home (only quitting long after I left for university). I can handle a bit of second-hand smoke with my pizza pie - but only if the pizza is good.]",1
4,"Like most people, I generally don't like running errands, especially ones that involve government services. However, this location strays far from the stereotype of rude, disgruntled post office employees, as the people who work here have always been kind and friendly to me.They also use a numbering system to keep track of who comes in first and who needs to be served first, which helps keep things running quickly and efficiently. Last time I went in, I grabbed a number, then picked out a bubble mailer, filled it, labeled it etc., and by the time I was done, my number was called. At my old post office, you would have to get in line after you finished labeling your envelopes and whatnot, so the way they do it here saved me a good bit of time. Every time I've been here, I've been in and out within 15 minutes. I have also never seen this place super crowded, despite the numerous times I have been in, including on a Friday afternoon. I think this is because people prefer to go to other post offices so they don't have to deal with the metered street parking (although the post office was lovely that one Friday afternoon, trying to find a spot to put my car was a headache and a half).All in all, this place is quick and efficient, the employees are nice and answer questions well, and it's my go to post office now.",2
5,"I had to plan a friends' bridal shower from Alaska, and was not familiar with any of the catering places in Wayne or the surrounding area. I'm sure glad I found Crocodile! They made everything so easy to coordinate from a distance, and were so friendly when I chatted with them on the phone about my order. The food was a hit at the bridal shower! One of the attendants was a vegetarian and said her vegetarian sandwich was the best she's ever had from a deli. The only negative, if you even want to refer to it as that, was the delivery came a half an hour early, and we had to stuff everything in the fridge so it wouldn't sit out for an hour before people showed up. Again, it wasn't really a negative since I would rather they have been early than late! I wish I lived in Wayne so I could eat at Crocodile and use their services more, they were great!",2
5,"I've been reading the bad reviews on this page, and they make me wonder if the reviewers have been to the same location I was at. I found the place spotlessly clean, and everyone was friendly to a fault. I'd like to give a special shout-out to Maisha (probably spelling that wrong), who was on duty at about 6:30 PM on Friday, October 16, 2015. She treated me and every other customer like we were her best friends - making sure everyone had everything they needed. Great experience!",2
5,"This place is the best, it's fantastic. 1$ beer on Thursdays which is seriously the best price in Tucson. I love guerro but this place has way better salsa bar. My friend kinda got screwed by this place because she eats only kosher, she ordered the fish and they gave her shrimp in her tacos. But as long you're not kosher, the shrimp is great.",2
3,disclosure: review is for food only and not on the whiskey unfortunatelya friend took me here expressing this was the best burger in all of philly. service was efficient and there wasn't a wait at all that tuesday evening at 6pm. we were bummed they didn't have a happy hour. the burger portion was super generous and i had trouble eating it without my utensils. the quality of the ingredients was great but i still felt as if something was missing.. wish there was an extra sauce or dressing element to make it a bit juicer though the meat was far from dry. it was just missing something for me. there was a long list of add on's (at a cost) that maybe i should have splurged on? it was pretty dark in there and i was too lazy to tackle that part of the menu. i was uncomfortably full after so i'd probably share a burger if there is ever a next time.it was a decent burger but not worth any potential long wait and definitely out of my normal price range for a burger. this place left me really missing home/in n'out...,1
4,"I had the Entrecôte Grillée et Frites (picture included) and my wife had the Boudin Stuffed Porkchop. Both meals were amazing. In addition, we walked in on a Friday at 5pm with no reservation and were seated immediately. The only negative comment is the that the wait staff seemed stretched a little thin. We got our drink orders and it was probably 10-15mins before they came back to see if we were ready to order. I even noticed the couple next to us also trying to get the wait staffs attention so they could pay their bill.Overall, it was a great experience and we plan to come back in the near future.",2
5,Had a great time out with the girls! The instructor was super patient with these non-artistic painters. Everything somehow turned out the way it should look. Great time! Definitely recommended!!,2
4,"Great French Quarter location, especially after dark when you walk out the door, turn to your left and see the giant shadow of Saint Louis (I presume--see photo) cast all the way up the backside of the St. Louis Cathedral. It's eerie and grand, and lends the perfect note of spookiness to the atmosphere of the Bourbon Orleans--which alegedly has ghosts. It's old, after all, and in the French Quarter. I reckon it's not so easy to find an unhaunted hotel in these parts, the city that is called--among other things--the most haunted city in America.  New Orleans also has some of the best food, music, art and people anywhere. But back to the hotel, there is a certain just-past-its-prime grandeur to the decor. I liked it. My room was spacious, clean and quiet; it overlooked the lovely pool area, and had a comfy King size bed. The staff was friendly and quick. While the French Quarter was not particularly damaged by the hurricane, many New Orleans neighborhoods were--and are far from full recovery post-Katrina. So go there and see the city and enjoy the fun of the Quarter. And don't forget the tragedy that befell the people of NOLA who love their town and are still fiercely working to rebuild, when much of the world has already moved on.",2
5,"How has anyone not given this place 5 stars. Food was great, service was even better. We did make reservations, but only 45 minutes prior to us arriving. Steamed chocolate dessert was by far my favorite.Thanks for a wonderful evening",2
2,"The people are cool and the sauces are good but other than that this place really doesnt have much going for it. Its just way too much like Taco Bell for me but with higher prices. I have to spend about $10 here just to get full, the portions simply arent that big, about Taco Bell size...and flavor for that matter. The decor reminds me of a McDonalds from 1988. The giant cookies are pretty blah. Pretty tasteless and unaplealing stuff here. If you like to spend a fortune trying to get full on Taco Bell like food then youll love it here. Only gave two stars cause the staff and music are cool.",0
5,"Wonderful!  We had the shrimp risotto and fried green tomato stack-amazing!  For entrees, the yellow fin tuna and trout were especially tasty. Dessert of red velvet ice cream cookies knocked it out of the park. Our server, Brock, was delightful.",2
4,"I usually steer clear of the chain restaurants (since there are so many other good restaurants here in STL), but eating at Brio was a good choice.  I've had brunch, lunch, and dinner here and all were fantastic.  It was also pretty easy to get last minute reservations.  The mushroom ravioli was delicious...I'd definitely get it again!",2
5,"Met a friend here over Christmas holiday. I was immediately a fan of the relaxed and creative ambiance. I N T E N T I O N A L I T Y.The word that best describes Room 901. From the decor, to the drink list, the owner, Peg, has worked tirelessly to create a Whiskey Bar that celebrates the brown liquid through and through. The pours have all been carefully curated for those looking to enjoy all that whisk(e)y has to offer. Her passion really shines here. Would absolutely recommend to anyone who's a fan of fine distilled spirits. Will absolutely be making the trip back to visit the next time I'm in town.",2
5,"We ate breakfast here twice so far and great food, prices are very reasonable! Biscuits & gravy, omelette, home fries, French toast are all great choices. Leigh was our waitress, very nice to talk to!",2
5,Great coffee! Got a T-shirt I love there too. Not much else to say. Just great coffee  go ahead- try it!,2
2,This place is adorable but expensive. I went in & bought one piece of hummingbird cake & one lemon bar to go & it was $19. When I opened my bag it looked like half the piece of cake was gone. If you want to charge me this much for a piece of cake then give me a full slice of cake.,0
5,I am new to homebrewing and am so thankful for this place! I've been in once and they answered all my questions. I've even called in when I was having trouble getting my keg tapped and they very pleasantly helped me figure out was was wrong! I love Philly Homebrew Outlet and will be purchasing from them in the future!,2
5,"We've been eating here for years but I've never written a review. I like to try a place for a while to give a true objective opinion. Not true! But if that were the case then I'd have to say that Top Hog is consistently good. Don't go in thinking that this is apretty, trendy burger cafe. It's not! It's a place where construction workers, bankers and senior adults eat good food. You get called ""sweetie"" and ""darling"" and ""Hun"". You drink sweet tea (that could rot your teeth) in big ole mason jars and you may just have to take a seat with people you may or may not know if you're in a hurry. There's no waiting area and it's crowded. Always crowded! But...if you're willing to overlook some imperfections you won't be disappointed. They have a small selection but have perfected it all. I have to say that some things aren't the best when compared to other places but I think all of Gallatin agrees that you can't find a better basic burger/cheeseburger or catfish. Don't worry about the location. You don't need a police escort as some would lead you to believe. It's safe and attracts a great mix of our community. They've managed to remain through many economic turns and that proves he's doing something right. Just an add-on..the guy helps his community. They're great people. Go support them.",2
5,"This food experience was very well accepted. Claire, our server was awesome and knew exactly what she was talking about. She knew how to dramatically explain all the dishes. Eddie, the manager was really great to talk with. The service was excellent and the food was off the chain! I definitely recommend trying this place.",2
3,"Good sushi, slow service and moderately expensive. They did bring us free edamame because of our wait and couldn't have been nicer. We had 3 rolls, 2 hot sake, 3 beers for $60. The big Sapporo was $10. The edamame was awesome, the philly roll was awesome as is the standard, the spicy tuna was good and the dragon roll wasn't for me, I didn't enjoy it. For two people I felt the meal was worth about $40-$45 not the $60 we paid. I will probably try somewhere else the next time I get a hankering for sushi. The decor is plain and simple, a few large tables, people sit together, it wasn't too crowded. Nice people, good food, a bit overpriced. I wouldn't not recommend it but it's not the greatest. I'd give it 2.5 stars if I could but I'll err on the nice side",1
4,I love this place! The pizza is perfection due in part to the wood fired oven. The appetizers are great too. They use really ingredients and it shows. It is a simple neopalatin style pizza but the flavors all work well to make a great pizza. Service is great and they always have a amazing selection of beers.,2
5,"Love this local bookstore. It was on my radar after Reese Witherspoon was spotted, and I am so glad it was! Great selection of books, fun children's section, great cards, postcards, mugs and other gifts too. The staff were very friendly and I noticed one employee really taking time to help a mom find a good book for her daughter. There are also comfy chairs to sit in the middle of the store to read too. Really enjoyed my time and highly recommend you visit!",2
5,I had a wonderful massage here. Jeani got all my pressure points. She also checked to make sure she was applying the right amount of pressure. I felt so relaxed afterwards.,2
5,"This is one of my favorite little neighborhood places for breakfast. Cute art work, good energy and the food is soooo good and the owner so nice and attentive when he is there on Sunday brunches.   I adore the blueberry and mint iced tea that they make there, it is the best. The grits are so good they turned this Yankee into a grits lover. It is such a fun, consistent and lovely place to spend a morning.",2
4,"I was craving for a lavender latte from the mud house but wasn't able to find a parking spot and was crunched on time. I finally saw where whisk was located and there was plenty of parking so I decided to go in (yes whisk is not too far from mud house but only had 8 mins to spare). I wanted to try their Popsicles but whenever I walked in and saw a lavender scone. I totally forgot about them. I'm so happy I stopped into whisk because OMG their lavender scones are absolutely delicious!!!! I came here on a Wednesday afternoon....the case was not full of goodies but just enough to pick a few.What I tried....Strawberry Whoopie Pie: I got this for my nephew. It was good! Something with the cream, it's light and fluffy! And not too sweet at all!Salted Caramel Cupcake: recommend by staff. It was really good but way too super sweet. One bite and I was done, the icing is just way too rich for my tasting. Bacon Chocolate Chip Cookie: another recommendation by staff. I tasted bacon once throughout the entire cookie. For some reason I don't think bacon in a cookie goes together. Something I didn't care for. Lavender Scone: it was calling my name but I had to ask...if they were moist and not super dry. The girl was right! She told me it was buttery and not dry at all. I hate dry scones. But OMG!!! Out of the world yummy! If I didn't have the lavender scone I'm sure my rating would of been a 3 star. LOL!! But I was craving something lavender.I will be back to try other goodies! Especially the Popsicles and scones! If you like lavender and scones. You must have one from here!",2
4,"Came with my mom and brothers. We polished off 4 appetizers, an entree and 15 rolls. Definitely got our money's worth!! They were super busy so we did wait slightly longer than preferred. But the servers were all working quickly and never forgot anything we ordered special. And my family can be difficult. Its not our favorite as far as taste but the quality was surprisingly amazing for the price. Definitely the top choice when we have a hardcore appetite to fulfill and want a bargain. Was out first time but we will be back... and soon!",2
4,"If I were to visit the Philly area (even though it's about 30 minutes away) again I'd stay here.It was clean, bright, and very well maintained. My bill was around $133 for a suite on a Friday night. I left early in the morning so I skipped the complimentary breakfast.",2
5,I love this place! They offer a unique take on Mexican food and drinks. Try the fermented maize beer and chicharrones!,2
4,"Did not catch our servers name but he was amazing and made the experience that much better. He reccomended the Scallop and Shrimp entree, and to get it over pasta and it was outstanding. My son ordered the kids cheeseburger. I was a little disappointed because the rolls they use are plain store bought potato rolls that I buy at the supermarket all the time.",2
4,"Good food for a chain restaurant.  There dinner for two menu is a decent buy at $40 with two soups, one appetizer, two entrees and a dessert.  Plenty of food. I give it a four for a chain restaurant.  But a three overall.  I prefer to avoid the chains but when necessary PFChangs is a great choice.",2
5,"The experience here definitely sets the bar for all nail salons! If great customer service is what you're looking for, this is the definitely the place for you. From the first time I walked into this place I felt more like a guest than a customer. They are dedicated to making sure you are a satisfied customer/guest and I refuse to go elsewhere! In other salons I've always felt like an inconvenience as a walk-in or if I ever expressed my dissatisfaction with any part of a service but here they have made it very clear that excellence is their standard!",2
3,"I have had a few pretty good experiences here and one really negative one that prompted our party to leave before eating. Generally speaking, the food is good. It's the best Italian in town, in my opinion, but my mother would fight me on that one. They start you off with some complimentary bruschetta, which is nice. I recommend the Mixed Baby Greens salad to start, which is more like a Greek salad and is a generous portion for $5. I would also recommend the Porcini Stuffed Agnolotti. I have tried a few of their desserts - I liked the Chocolate Souffle but thought the Coppa Pistachio left something to be desired. The free limoncello shot at the end of the meal is a nice touch.The problem here is the service. It seems that there is always a wait, even if you have a reservation. I don't usually mind waiting but they have very little standing room and no vestibule, so you end up standing by the door and get blasted with cold air every time someone opens it. I went recently with my family for their lunch buffet, which looked quite nice. We ended up waiting about 25 minutes, during which the hostess sat several smaller parties (which is fine), then started to seat a slightly larger party that had come in long after us. When we interjected to find out what was going on and why we had been passed over, the hostess said something along the lines of ""Oh I don't know, you all walked in at once."" We had been there much longer, but apparently she hadn't been keeping a list (she told us so) even though she had been taking names. Isn't that what hostesses DO? Only upon us asking why this was happening and expressing our unhappiness with the service did she run off to check with a manger then report back that she needed to seat the larger party, without explanation. By this time the buffet was close to its end time and it seemed silly to pay only to receive the last bits and pieces, so we decided to leave and go down the street to Kooma where we were seated immediately and had a delicious brunch!This restaurant is fine and a good choice if you are craving Italian food, but I generally prefer other places in West Chester. Also, be prepared for a wait and a potentially rude hostess!But by the way, Richard works here now - he used to work at Gilmore's and is the best waiter in town!",1
4,"I took one look at the large greasy slice in front of my eyes and knew I had made an adequate decision. While I was forced to poney up a solid 8 dollars for two slices which is rather insane, the pizza was good, and it's state street so come on.As a New York native I live by the credo that only pizza which can be folded in half can actually be considered pizza. While the cheese to sauce ratio was slightly in favour of the queso the crust was solid enough to uphold the amount of grease, which personally I found refreshing. In a world of pizzeria chains which are stretching the definition of pizza it was nice to grab a delicious old school style slice even if the price was ridiculous. Would eat again",2
5,"Amazing friendly service, approachable atmosphere, and food is so delicious! Try the sweet potatoes and the gnocchi with blue cheese - seriously can't beat this place. Almost don't want to share because it is that good...!",2
5,Michael who took my phone order and greeted me was very polite and professional! That's hard to find- great customer service! Good job whoever hired him!,2
3,"Ok beer. Ok food. We like breweries because we have a kid and like beer. So we go to a lot of breweries. The service was excellent. Food, beer, good",1
1,terrible food and the manager was shockingly rude when I tried to return my food. I had the frogs legs and they were rubbery and tasted awful. I was disgusted by her behavior and she should be ashamed of herself. I have never been treated more horribly by someone.,0
4,In-house red amber ale was excellent. Grilled chicken sandwich and buttered sweet potatoe fries were a perfect pairing too. If I ever visit NO again I'll come back.,2
5,"Delicious! Had the shrimp and grits, croque Madame and the seafood gumbo. All amazing!!! We ate every last bite! Definitely will be coming back here on our next trip to Nola!",2
2,Food was nothing special.  Sides were cafeteria style nothing seemed home made.  Fried Chicken was the best thing.,0
2,"We were led here by the glowing Yelp reviews and the fact that we had a wonderful meal at Mad Fish last year (owned by the same person as 1200). What a mistake.First off the place is tiny and extremely loud.  I ordered the sea bass, but they were out of it - at 7pm?  Next I tried to order the grouper special - again out of it.  Richard, our waiter told me (confidentially per him) that he could give me the 8 oz lobster tail for $24 along with the mashed potato side and my choice of broccoli or asparagus.  Chose the asparagus.  ChipOrdered the Berkshire pork chop with a pepper rub, mashed potatoes and asparagus.  My lobster was good, but no way was this tail 8 oz before cooking.  Chip's pork chop was a spectacle of gristle and fat.  Despite its huge size he probably got about a half portion due to the bad cut of meat.  His potatoes were pretty good. His asparagus were missing, but when he saw the sad little overcooked spears I received, he figured he'd pass.When Richard came back and asked if we wanted a box for the uneaten gristle and fat we told him it wasn't necessary and explained why.  To his credit, he apologized and removed the $15 charge for my glass of Groth Sauvignon Blanc, which we thanked him for and appreciated the gesture.When we got the bill I noticed that I was given an additional charge for the asparagus, even though that was not mentioned when he offered the choice of broccoli or asparagus.I should say that the house chopped salad, rolls and maple butter were delicious and that's what made me give 1200 two stars instead of one.Avoid at all costs.  Between the noise factor, lack of listed entrees at 7pm and the bs crap with the vegetable, there are many other places that deserve your tourist dollars more.",0
3,"Slow service, but seating outside is nice if you can snag a table during peak hours. Just expect to wait a tad, and don't be in a hurry. Both times I have been to this restaurant, the food hasn't been great, but they do have a good menu. Not thrilled that they do not have a bar...",1
5,"Staff was friendly, drinks were delicious, orders were fast and efficient, and prices are reasonable. Great place to grab a coffee!",2
1,"Change the name of this place to ""$12 a night just to park at this dump"" and maybe there is a chance at more than one star because I never made it past the less than persuasive garage attendant. It is trashy but common to charge customers park if you are located downtown or adjacent to the airport. This place is neither and has no excuse. It is located at the corner of bad neighborhood and interstate noise.",0
3,"Neighborhood dive bar, fun atmosphere. My vodka tonics were 80% ice.",1
4,"Went to dinner with friends. Started out with the Beet and Goat Cheese Salad. It was very good. For the entree I had the fisherman's stew. It was good but not as good as I had hoped. Decent amount of seafood and a nice, but not great, broth. Also I couldn't understand why it wasn't served with bread. Would have been nice to be able to dip it in the sauce. Service was good and attentive. Atmosphere was fine.",2
1,"Don't waste your money at Concord Pet Supply. I bought two dog beds from them, one large and one small. The small bed was folded together between a stack of beds. I thought this will work for my MinPin. After bringing home and realizing that it wouldn't fit him and that the bed continues to fold back in on itself, never standing up properly, I thought I'd go back and exchange it for a larger one that was a different style. I didn't even have the unused bed for 24hrs when I went back to do an exchange. I was told that they don't do pet bed returns, which no one tells you about when you purchase it, but rather is on the last line on the receipt, which no one reads. The bed wasn't used, the sale wasn't 24hrs old, and I was told that I was shit out of luck. Rather than explain to me and allow me to exchange for a larger bed that cost more, I was turned away. Not very hospitable or customer friendly. Save your money and go down the street to Pet Supply Store where they are much more friendly, on average a few dollars cheaper, and willing to work with the customer when they have an issue. The store manager Rob is awesome and has the right approach to customer service. Don't buy from a store that isn't willing to help after spending $100 bucks plus the day before. #neveragainfromconcordpet",0
4,Turkey Club was excellent. Quaint.  Good service. Just across from the beaches. Check it out. Big menu. Recommended.,2
4,"I'm a fan! Sunova beach has great drink specials and is also a good place to watch sports. I'm a big fan of being able to drink beer and watch a game outside, without melting in the sun. They pump the AC out onto the patio area to keep everyone cool while you can still enjoy the fresh air. Beer-wise, there isn't a huge selection, but there are a fair amount of drafts available. The food is good for bar food, and well priced. I like the fries (you can select one of about 10 sauces to go with them, included) and the wings. Different food and drink specials nearly every night of the week. They also have a free parking lot so that you do not have to pay for valet (I'm looking at you Yard of Ale and McDinton's) which really kicks them up a notch. I've been probably 10 times and it was always a good experience.",2
4,"I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars, but have decided to go with the more generous offering?  Why?  Because this place has one of the most generous menus as far as choices go.  There is a ton to choose from, even if you're vegetarian.  Formalities first--why can't there be some ambiance at Indian restaurants.  I know I'm painting with broad strokes here, but it seems like outside of NYC, no Indian restaurant in the US can get creative with their dining space.  Not sure why that is, but whatever.An early arrival on a Sunday found the place quiet, with maybe 10 or so people dining.  No problem getting a table for 2.  We started the evening off with some garlic Naan.  Delicious, although I think next time I'll stick with regular, at almost half the cost.  We also got some Finger Paneer, little spiced fried cubes of cheese.  These were denser than typical Paneer.  The cheese was slightly bland, but the spices were good.  Overall, an enjoyable start to the meal.  I also had a lemonade, which may have been made fresh.  Regardless, it was tasty. Entrees included Paneer Bhurji and Lamb Shahi Korma.  We elected ""spicy"" as our seasoning level.  I'll admit, I have a pretty strong ability to deal with spiciness.  But this was some ultra-spicy food when it arrived!  We quickly ordered a mango lassi to help put out the fire.  Still, even through the spices, there were decent flavors coming through.  The nutiness of the Korma was especially nice, as was the blended creaminess.I'm intrigued enough to return for more offerings.  I am humbled however by their spiciness--something that has not happened to me in many many years.  Next time, I am going to stick with ""medium"" spiciness!",2
5,"You just can't pass this up! Very neat, all ages, incredible musicians. Definitely make it part of your NO trip.",2
5,"I went to the pearl for my birthday and every detail of the experience was awesome!  The food, the wine and the service were all impeccable!  We didn't realize the time and were chatting away after closing time and the staff never made us feel rushed.",2
1,"Staff are wonderful. Bartender was extremely pleasant. Other than that a horrible nightmare. Interesting decor, though trying to hard.Dirty carpeting and dark rooms.  Super loud air conditioning unit, bring ear plugs, or don't sleep. Fancy shower unit but leaky doors and mildew. Light bulb went out in the middle of the night, forced to shower in the dark; no body is regularly changing the bulbs to prevent this. Would avoid staying over night.",0
1,"Wallet was stolen today at this starbucks.  The workers there were not helpful at all.  They wanted me to ""file a report"" to corporate and would call if it showed up.  Meanwhile someone was having fun with my credit card in cherry hill, new jersey.  And they made it seem like it was my fault that it was stolen, but it was stolen when i was sitting with my items. Not helpful or sympathetic.",0
5,"This place made me want to move to Boise. Everyone was very friendly, and the space is beyond cool. Also a great selection of beers from the NW.",2
3,"The little dining huts in the outdoor seating area are sooo cute and inviting for this little spot! They were occupied when I arrived, but nice touch!Service was great. With the help of our waiter I was able to customize by combo of beef, mixed veggies and ginger for $13.95. Entree comes with a side Tom Kha soup or salad. I could tell the soup was well made, I'm just personally not a huge fan of the taste of fish sauce and coconut milk mixed...ha, should have ordered salad. Anyway, the rest of the food was okay. Again, well prepared, but lacked a bit of seasoning. The American in me added salt and pepper, but I think it needed something else. Filling and healthy nonetheless. On another visit I would order something else. I did really enjoyed the shrimp roll that came along with the combo. I believe it was like a fried rice roll. I wasn't crazy about the egg roll. The hot ginger tea was very nice and soothing for a cool Santa Barbara evening. It was a bit chilly, so upon request our waiter turned on the outdoor heaters for us which was nice touch. Everyone in my party seemed to enjoy their meals. Even though I wasn't wowed, I'd come here again...but I'm snagging a hut and ordering something else.",1
5,"Decent price, nice people. The environment of the place was great, vet home like feeling. Has been there for 41 years one of the ladies said and I don't see it going away anytime soon",2
5,"Its a great place for Brunch.We tried the Wildflower Triple where you can substitute any of the 3 items with sausage or biscuit or anything else. We couldn't figure out which one we wanted to try, so this choice was easy! The food was spectacular and the service was very friendly! We are here for two more days, so we might come back tomorrow or the day after.",2
1,"Four of us just had hibachi dinners at Megu in Cherry Hill.  Unbelievably disappointing.  For some reason the waitress just ignored the four of us.  She took orders from multiple people around us, who had come in after we sat down and started delivering food to their tables before she ever came to our section of the hibachi table or acknowledged us.  I had to get the manager to get served. The hibachi chef was one of the least skilled that I have ever seen.  One in our party ordered filet mignon.  He cooked all the dinners at our table, then after he served everyone realized that he hadn't cooked the filet, cooked it and gave it to the wrong person.  My friend didn't realize the mistake.  However, my wife pointed it out to me after we left.  Let me also mention that the place looks very worn and unkempt.  needless to say we will not be back.  Do yourself a favor and eat at any number of other Japanese restaurants that know what quality and good service mean.",0
1,"Gee, Normands. It would have been nice if you had seen fit to update your website with the fact that you are closed for construction during a good chunk of August. That way, my husband and i wouldn't have wasted time trying you this morning. Good thing Craft Beer Market was open. Seriously. Add a freaking contact page to your website with important stuff like hours and you know, CLOSURES? Once my husband has been burned by a place, it is nearly impossible to get him to return, so chances are, you may have lost him (us) for good.",0
5,Great view and terrific food. Nice way to relax and have a casual day with great food.,2
5,"I'd actually give them 4 or 4.5 stars but considering the pretentious nitwits who have given them 1 star, I figure I need to make up the difference.  I've been coming to Gullifty's for over 20 years now and I have got to say it's always been one of my favorite spots on the Mainline.  Nice comfort food and overall consistency in both food and service.  If they were located in Philly, they'd get 4 stars.  Considering the options on the Mainline, they get 5.I've always liked the sandwiches, the appetizers (the beer battered onion rings are amazing, as is the fried cheese), the pizzas (the apple and bacon pizza remains a favorite), the pastas are excellent.  And their cheesecake is to die for -- unlike any restaurant cheesecake, it really tastes homemade.  My daughter likes their ribs, I'm not terribly impressed with the salmon, but the fish and chips is a good one.All in all, a solid neighborhood selection for from-scratch food.  Order on MLD and beat the crowds.",2
5,"Went as a team outing after work. It was fun, interesting and tasty. The menu is fixed, except for the choice of lamb or chicken. We had the chicken and it just fell off of the bones. The appetizer plate through the mint tea was all delicious. Fun atmosphere. I will be going back soon! I think it was $35 a head.",2
1,"Second night in a row at 2 Different LaQuintas, both times I am questioning whether the room has been cleaned properly, coffee stains and cup rings at one, and when I opened the door on the second, a piece of the heating/AC unit laying on the floor on one side of the bed and a empty to go cup on the other....needless to say, extremely disappointed",0
3,"Harry and Izzy's was okay. Just okay. The decor is very swank and dim, but the effect was mostly ruined when the host guided us through three different server staging areas and up a narrow staircase to get to our table. We'd made a reservation for six, but were seated at a table for five. Our server was nice but strangely over-eager. The food was good and the portions were sizable, but there was nothing exceptional about it, and some of the dishes were over salted.I will say that the shrimp cocktail was damn tasty.All in all, Harry & Izzy's met my basic expectations for a pricy steakhouse but did nothing to exceed them. I'd go back, but I won't rush back.",1
4,"I'm visiting St. Louis for a few days and had a taste for Indian food! I decided to opt out of some of the more expensive restaurants in favor of this restaurant. I am glad I did! This place is a little deceiving (its a small restaurant in a strip mall) but boy, does it deliver. Everyone I went with enjoyed the food, it was fresh and extremely delicious. Not to mention, quite affordable! The owner was friendly to boot. Check this place out for a really good meal!",2
2,Very disappointed! Spent 70$ on tickets! (More on drinks) and wasn't able to see the main show because I needed to put money in the meter so my car wasn't towed! The concert was my birthday present and didn't even get to see them. Very bummed. No where was is posted it was a closed event. So had no idea the meter would be an issue. Just plain bummed about the night!,0
4,"Gizmo ' s is your typical resale booth mall that rents booth space to individuals. Gizmo's Mall doesn't seem to have as much turn-over as other mall locations. Spaces consist of used clothing, including wedding and prom dresses, jewlery, all types of home decor and collectables, vintage glassware, coin collections and antique furniture. A few booths focus on the renter's own craft projects of floral arrangements, homemade soaps, candles, aprons, wreathes, woodworking pieces and refurbished furniture. Most have a theme or similarity within their booth space but you'll run across a few that are just a hodgepodge of random items. The majority of booths are fairly well organized and clean but again, a couple have dropped the ball. If available, an employee tries to walk around checking on customers and takes any items you are carrying to the front for you. They place your items in one of the hold baskets until you're ready to check out.I'm usually on a mission searching for something fairly specific when I shop here. Occasionally I walk out without anything and other times I stumble across a great deal or unique find. The prices obviously vary greatly from booth to booth but are comparable to other booth malls. The folks working at the counter are super friendly and helpful. One thing I'd love to see is decluttering of the counter tops. It's getting harder and harder to find space to even sit your purse down to pay much less place your items.Worth a trip if you're in the area. With holidays starting everyone will step up their game and restocking booths often with new items. Grab it when you see it because the holidays get hectic.",2
4,"Best tacos I've had in a long time! This will now be my go to taco place when I'm craving Mexican food. The prices can't be beat and whether you get the seasoned beef, chicken, or steak tacos they are all the same price. My wife got the burrito and it was huge and was presented very well! We will definitely be back and I've even told some friends that we will need to go!",2
3,"My roommate and I began our best brunch search months ago and stumbled into Refuel when we first started. After going back a couple of times since, I can say the food is good and the ambiance is great but whole package isn't my top brunch spot in the city, or even in my top 5 (granted, there are a lot of brunch places in New Orleans). I heard great things about their french toast so I went in with high hopes and was told they no longer serve it!! So, if you're in a sweet mood, get the Belgian waffle with all the goods on the side at no extra cost and share it with a trusted diner. I'd be happy to return to check out their new menu, so hopefully that will up my brunch scale rating!",1
2,Usually packed. Line moves slow. I notice the employees don't really care about what they are doing. They rush making the food trying to just get the line to move without caring. Small portions for what they charge. Have been to many chipotle restaurants and this one gives the least amount of food. Not good for returning customers. Will not be back.,0
4,"Love love love their pizza!!!!!  We went there for the first time tonight. We started with the honey buffalo wings. This is probably the only reason they got 4 and not 5 stars. The wings were on the small side. Aside from that they were not crispy and I didn't taste any honey in the sauce. I'd probably order them again but make sure you specify extra crispy. The pizza however, was awesome. I got the Parma. I made sure they added the arugula AFTER the pizza was cooked. It was so good that even though I'm stuffed I can't wait until I'm hungry again so I can enjoy my leftovers!  They also had a twisted pretzel beer that tasted like a pretzel!!!  It was so good and not heavy even though it was a dark beer. Make sure to go next door and get some gelato for dessert.",2
5,"We were thoroughly impressed with this hotel! Upon arriving, you are immediately welcomed with the scent of fresh baked cookies. Walking up to the desk we were greeted by Valorie who informed us that cookies and water were complementary to guests and that we were more than welcome. Across from the desk we noticed a book shelf. This is not the kind of book shelf where rejected leftovers were placed but rather, a wide range of books by well known authors. The name of the program was called Read it and Return. In essence, you can borrow a book for the duration of your stay and if you don't finish it you can return it the next time you stay at the hotel at any of the Carlson hotels who have the same program! ( what!?! Cookies and books!?! YES!) Right off the bat, we felt like we were right at home.   Arriving at our room, we noticed that everything was extremely clean and there was a refrigerator (with a small freezer) , a microwave, a coffee maker, and a well working A.C. (you know, the kind that you don't have to yell over to have a conversation). The bathroom was stocked with brand name shampoo, conditioner, and lotion.  Our next stop was the smoking area. Normally, smokers feel as though they have been marooned to a small place behind the dumpster...but not here! Provided was 2 sets of swinging benches; set far enough away so that it did not disturb the guests in rooms around the area but no a 10 mile hike for those adults who enjoy the pleasure. Did I also mention they have smoking rooms available?In the morning, feel free to partake in a complimentary breakfast (NOT CONTINENTAL)-I mean a real breakfast which changes daily; anything from fresh made waffles to eggs, sausage, and bacon! Also, cold cereal, juices, and coffees have options! Coffee is available 24/7 as well! The hotel also has a pool and hot tub which I personally observed them clean daily!On our last night we got back late and I was going to ask the desk for a late check out, but there was no need! Their check out time is 12:00 Pm as opposed to the hotel usual of 11:00 Am. That worked out well for us.At checkout we were asked if there was anything we would change about the hotel or our stay. I made small suggestions which I thought would help them, but definitely nothing major. The desk person wrote down what I said and said she would pass it on! I was impressed with that, because we've been asked about our stay at other places, but it seemed more out of routine than actual interest. Here, she seemed genuinely interested. We don't usually do reviews, so I'm sorry for the long review. However, we wanted you to get a real feel for this wonderful hotel and hope that you enjoy it as much as we did! Thanks for reading and safe travels. J & Niki.",2
5,"The only mechanic I've ever had that is fair, honest and always does quality work.  I have a Mercedes and I'd recommend them to anyone.  Friendly as well!",2
5,Every time I go visit my sister in law and family we stop by early early Saturday to get these donuts!  Yummy.....  The best!,2
5,"Great little family joint.  Shrimp, oyster and crawfish all delicious",2
3,"Went here for dinner today. Here is the review, good and bad. We got salsa and that was homemade and it was delicious! Also, the steak was not too bad, just slightly burnt. It was alright. The fries were very good, the bread was yummy. Overall a good or okay experience. Wish the steak wasn't so burnt, but I'll be back!",1
3,"Nothing extraordinary, but it tasted like a home cooked meal. I had the Chicken and Rice which is the special on Saturday. Chicken tenderloins, over a bed of wild brown rice and a mushroom cream sauce. I would eat here again.",1
5,"Howard's the man for all things VW.  It can take a few weeks to make an appointment, but he's thorough, reliable, knowledgeable and efficient.",2
4,"It was the first time we had Ethiopian food but we went looking for it.  The first thing we noticed was the unfamiliar yet inviting scent of frankincense hanging in the air.  We were there early for lunch so we assumed they had just burned some incense. Without experience, we decided on the sampler appetizer and the Queens Eight Platter, a sampling of four veg and four meat entrees.  Everything was explained to us, the customary way to eat without utensils, as well the names of the samples on the platter.  The uniqueness of the bread,  Injera to the variety of seasonings in the food was a fun experience.  Even the Ethiopian iced tea was unique and added to the experience.It was more than we could eat and a well sized to-go box was made at the table, along with reheating instructions.  All in all, the staff was very friendly, the atmosphere was was just right, and the food was great.  We would certainly go back and try more of the menu.",2
5,Great choice in a small shop. Worth the drive. The wine cakes are excellent! Just went here for first time based on yelp reviews and will definitely be going back,2
4,"This in my go to sushi place in center city. The food is always fresh and tastes good. My go to is the Kano crunch house special roll. It comes covered in spicy mayo and crunchy caviar on top. I recently discovered the ak-47 roll which comes with shrimp tempura, cream cheese, avocado, and a special soy paper on the outside. It's very good as well. For appetizer I love the rock shrimp which is covered in a sauce similar to spicy mayo and drizzled in soy sauce, it is crunchy and amazing. The California roll I would say is pretty standard compared to other places. They also offer a lunch special on weekdays!",2
4,"This place is always there for me when I need a pick me up. The coffee is great (as great as convenience store coffee can be!) and there's always an energy drink of sorts on sale. You can find a decent lunch in a pinch as well, the vegetarian/vegan section has some good finds and the chicken tenders are surprisingly good and inexpensive. The staff is always friendly and more than willing to help you or grab what you want if it's not on the shelf. As much as I love & miss Wawa, I am thankful for a nice, clean, friendly place to grab caffeine close to my work.",2
5,"I was so happy with my experience here.  Not only was our food great but our waiting was amazing.  After a weekend of disappointing hotel, salon and restaurant experiences I was over the moon for our waiter.  I wish I got his name!  I had a part of 6 + a toddler.  The way the room was laid out he could not access both sides of our table without going around another table.  He was so great about serving not only the food and drinks we ordered but at one point he picked up the wine we brought from one side of the table, went around the neighboring table and brought it to my mom who had finished her wine.  He was nice and funny and he was always on the look out for anything we needed.  I'm so appreciative for our service at this restaurant and would return again and again.",2
5,Wow! It definitely lived up to the hype! One of the best meals I've had in my life. We were lucky enough to sit up at the bar and watch the chefs cooking. I had the chorizo/ manchego Dutch baby pancake and my husband had the quiche. Both were outstanding! We also ordered the biscuit and cinnamon sugar donut which are not to be missed! What a fun experience! Indy is so lucky to have Milktooth!,2
4,Wife and I got the eggs Benedict. I am an eggs Benedict lover (I'll Admit it) whoever first decided to put together poached eggs English muffins Canadian bacon and a creamy leaning sauce called Hollandaise is a genius. This eggs Benedict didn't disappoint. The English muffins was crunchy but not over toasted the eggs were poached perfect the Canadian bacon was done solidly and the Hollandaise a homerun. We also both got grits -- I thought they were great the ride thought a shade bland. I'll go with her assessment as she is from the South and so am a transplant. It is a bit pricey $42 for two but we were staying at the Royal Sonesta so it was convenient.,2
5,"Wow. The food, atmosphere, and service here are all phenomenal. Let me start with my favorite part - the menu is pasted into children's books which is so cool! The atmosphere is hipsterish - dim lighting, great music, and laid back vibe. I went on a Sunday for brunch and it was not too crowded, easy to walk in and get seated without a wait. SO MUCH BETTER THAN GREEN EGGS in my opinion. After much deliberation between various items, I ordered the chicken and waffles and in the words of DJ Tanner, OH MY LANTA. The seasoning on the chicken was beyond delicious (not dry at all, which is a complaint I often have about chicken) and the waffles were crisp and perfectly done. The syrup was not too rich and sweet and you could tell it was authentic, not the sugary thick store bought stuff. In addition, I have to say, I found the HOLY GRAIL of biscuits. These are not your small round KFC biscuits. They are HUGE, soft, mushy, delicious, amazing. I have been craving them every day since. They have cheddar bits baked inside and when you pull these freshly baked delights apart and take a bite, I guarantee a religious experience.If you can't tell, I loved this place.My only complaint -  Why haven't I been here before?!",2
1,"Sad!  Last time eating here.  Over priced, over cooked, under staffed!  Salad ok butt charged $2 for extra anchovies (4 total).  No background music in seating area so we could hear everything the cooks and staff did all weekend but they never ask if we needed anything.  The management has now called me a ""sad little man"" in her response.  I'm not sad just disappointed in a chain restaurant that use to be good.  You should be the one apologizing for the bad food.  And yes that young man was nice butt by then my lunch was already ruined by that horrible excuse of a roast pork sandwich.",0
5,VEGGIE CHILI. Never in my life have I ever craved vegetarian chili until I found this place. It's absolutely amazing. There really isn't anything on menu that's bad. They make everything to order so if you're a picky eater and one of the wraps has a few things you don't like they'll take them out for you. The staff here is also great. I've been going here for lunch fairly consistently for the past two years and it's been the same staff since my fist visit. Overall great lunch spot!,2
1,Every dam time we come here it's an issue!!! Either the steak isn't cooked right or hair in the plate or a piece of something in the kitchen got in the plate smh I try always giving the benefit of the doubt but this is far beyond that!!! The manager don't even care.. all he said was sorry instead of saying hey we will cook it to your liking or do you want something else instead!!! Nope he just came to the table and said oh sorry and walked away!!!!  His name is Amonte or something like that!!! I don't mind paying whatever for a good meal but this is ridiculous!!!! The waitress on the hand was awesome!!!,0
3,"I go to this casino very often and for long time now..I'm very upset I need to pay $10 every time I go there for parking.. it used to be free and it should be free, for a place like that, that profits really nicely... it should definitely be complementary.I understand that now they have construction expenses, but that will also bring more people and the casino will keep profiting even more than before.If not a complimentary parking for all, at least for locals!Besides that I would want to see healthier food options, organic at least for how pricy they are, but vegan options would be much better for everyone, and not only food that makes heart disease and cancer. Besides that the casino is clean, professional, and lots of fun!",1
5,"I've been here 5 times, and ordered the Chicken Veracruz Salad. I love it! (Almost obsessed with it lol) The cashier/server has always been nice and helpful. I'll keep going back!",2
5,"I love this place. My husband and I usually have a few beers and a meal once a month since they opened. The quality is great and the restaurant is comfortable. My husband usually orders the Reef Donkey, and I usually order off of the visiting taps, just to see what kind of beers are being made in our area. In terms of food, I love the hummus, the hot pretzel, the Greek salad, the burgers (I've tried nearly all of them, and they're great), and the pizza. I wanted to like the fish n chips, but the fish is just bland as heck. Chefs! Please add salt to your batter and marinate in buttermilk.",2
1,"We knew we had to wait in line, but the wait inside for food and drinks was ridiculous.  The waiter took a long time to come, she never checked on us and we had to get up 3 times to ask her for coffee and milk refills.  The pancakes are just OK, honestly IHOP has better pancakes.  Not impressed at all.",0
4,"My husband and I practically live here, and have through the past 8 years or so.  They have great food, prepared fast, great drink specials.",2
5,"From the atmosphere to the service and the food, M3 does not disappoint! The mascarpone polenta is soo good, and the stuffed risotto balls with tomato cream sauce will have you thinking about them days after your meal. Food is good quality and flavorful. Highly recommend!",2
5,Love it love it love it!!! I finally got to try the barrel for the first time! We got the sample for $12 and I also got Pinot noir an for was pretty good as usual! They have life music (first Friday) and the atmosphere is very nice and relaxing! So glad this place is in phoenixville!,2
4,"Love this spot! I've been here twice now, trying different dishes each time, and the food is consistently very good. Food: get the fried chicken. Also, get the Mac and cheese. You can feel guilty about it later. Atmosphere: cute and cozy with I've music. Just be warned that sitting near the musician means you won't be able to hear much of anything else. Service: always prompt and courteous!",2
4,"Great rolls and sake. We sat in the bamboo room, which definitely added to the experience, if you are able and agile.",2
5,The best Vietnamese food by far compared to the typical Vietnamese food found on Washington Ave.  I recommend the spring rolls and the vermicelli with grilled pork.  There are also vegan options as well.,2
1,"I had high hopes for this place since the parking lot was full. I ordered fish and chips, and got peas and macaroni and cheese on the side. My companion ordered the knackwurst and saurerkraut with mashed potatoes on the side. The main courses were all right. The macaroni and cheese was inedible for me. The flavoring tasted very artificial. My companion's mashed potatoes tasted like paper. We have eaten at enough establishments like this to know we can get better quality food for more affordable prices. We will not be returning.",0
3,"Friday, April 22, 2011Santa Barbara Eats: Tony Ray's Since my friend began managing downtown's newest mexican restaurant, he hasn't quit calling me to come in. Being the good friend that I am (or at least think I am), I decided to give into his hype.Tony Ray's, tucked away behind the State Street clamor, took me nearly twenty minutes to find, but in the end was worth the hassle.My friend and I chose to sit outside on this overcast Tuesday afternoon, mostly because the dribbling water of the patio's fountain - complete with plastic roses and hibiscus buoyed among its three tiers - was almost therapeutic. The restaurant's menu serves up your every day Mexican food, stuff you can find at just about every other taqueria or cantina in California. And like most other Mexican restaurants reaching out to their American counterpart, you find your burgers, steaks and chicken tenders served alongside fried papas. Munching on my chicken burrito, but more so picking at my friends steak fajitas, I recognized that there's a lot to appreciate from this hole in the wall.No. 1: the patio seating hosts a great view of the Riviera and De La Guerra Plaza; a popular hangout for Santa Barbara's homeless, but I digress.No. 2: The place is kind of a secret. With no front entrance to State Street, you'd never imagine a restaurant ever existed here. No. 3: This sit down lunch, complete with ice tea and more chips and salsa than you can handle, came to about $20. Nothing on this menu costs more than $10, except for the filet mignon, $24.Tony Ray's also holds karaoke night on Wednesday and Thursday nights.Hosting a full bar that's open for breakfast, lunch and dinner, the hole in the wall tries, and is worth giving a try. So if and when you go in, ask for Rony. Tell him I sent you.",1
4,"See's candies is California base bakery reach Florida. I know about this candies when my wife living in California. Their chocolate is very soft and tasty. In Tampa, the International Plaza Mall has this temporary store from Thanksgiving to Easter. They located very close to H&M clothing store. You can have samples before you buy it. I got the lollipop candies. I also bought one assorted chocolate candies. They are very good. The store clerk was kind enough to let us try their assorted chocolate other their typical sample candies. You can go with chocolate with nut, mint, toffee, milk, white or dark chocolate. All are good. Guilty pleasure with a touch at sweet side. Mail order through the web also available. If you close to the mall, just go to buy one without shipping.",2
5,Great ice cream. It is so creamy and delicious!  I had chocolate and butter pecan in a waffle cone. I ate the whole thing without losing a drop!  So yummy!  It is small and I imagine on a weekend or busy time of year it would be hard to eat inside.,2
5,"Excellent food, ambiance and location! I ate there for lunch during this trip to NOLA with my friend. I had the artichoke and crab salad - it was SO good! My mouth waters thinking of it now. My friend ate the grilled and roasted vegetable platter and everyhing was excellent! I highly recommend!",2
4,"This is my neighborhood gelateria. It is so cool I can say that. The gelato is really good. My favorites include dulce de leche, stracciatella, marscapone, lemon, caramel and the test of any great gelato maker chocolate. I have never had a bad flavor here and the staff are more than generous in letting you sample the flavors to make your decision. You can mix 2-3 flavors depending on the size you get as well. They also have solid coffee-fu and make a mean espresso. It is also a really nice mellow space to hang out in with lots of dark wood and a pressed tin ceiling (I am a total sucker for these); I like to play boardgames there with friends. There is a nice outdoor seating area now as well with a gate through which you can bring your canine companions to lounge with you (or I suppose felines on a leash). A great dessert to follow a meal on South Grand or just as a destination in itself. Plus it saves me from having to haul downtown and I can walk to it, which is beyond awesome.",2
4,"This place has grown on me, 6 months ago it would have been a 3, now I know what I like on the menu Ive moved it to a 4. The lady at the counter speaks little English so that's an issue with phone orders but they use fresh veggies and everything is made to order. 5.75, for 2 items with chow mein is hard to beat.",2
5,"Nice people, good wine. We enjoyed it here! After enjoying a trip up to SB on the train we stopped at a few places",2
2,"Hipsters unite!  I've never had a good time at The Taint, despite several people's attempts top tell me otherwise.  I'm not impressed by the apathy here, or the dirty-headed Garden District crapfest of regular clientele.  Boo.",0
5,"Couldn't ask for better off of bourbon street. We were waited on by the owner and she was wonderful. She explained the history of the drinks names and about the band. The drinks are petite but pack a huge punch( &10 a drink). We sat and listened to the four person jazz band and watched a football game. A perfect spot, I can't say enough good things about it.",2
5,All around class-act place. Really sharp looking bar and restaurant. We were just in for drinks but the food looked good. Casual modern and upscale place in a historic setting. From the hostess to the concierge everybody was very friendly. The bearded bartender was the star of the show. Nice to find a place with bartenders with personality.,2
3,"The woman running the counter is not very friendly. The first time we ate there the food was pretty good.  The second time, we ordered shrimp with lobster sauce and the egg was still raw,  made me ill considering I took a bite out of it. I didn't bother complaining since it was take out and I was already home.  I haven't been back.",1
4,"My daughter and I had breakfast here and it was good. She had pancakes and I had the eggs Benedict. The food was nice. Nothing really special, but I will definitely come back. The service was awesome though. It's obvious the people who work there have pride in their environment. It's really nice to see. I hope they do well!",2
4,First time here and I'm not disappointed. Great seasoning on the seafood. I ordered oysters and their $45 combo and some garlic chicken wings for a family of six. It was more than enough for us. Only thing I can complain about is she messed up on our order.,2
4,We stopped in on a fluke Saturday afternoon. We were treated to one of the best vegetarian pizzas we have ever had. I would certainly go back.,2
3,"Okay, not a great second experience. The first time I went was during happy hour and all I had were the tacos(lengua, Carne asada) there, amazing stuff. The visit today was not the same. I thought I would try a different dish: Chile Relleno. I ended up opting in to getting it stuffed with Carne Asada which I thought would enhance it greatly. . .not exactly. To start, and maybe end, the ""Chile Relleno"" was covered in what seemed to be a marinara sauce, not good at all. Not a Chile Relleno. The tacos I got were good though.",1
5,I love Sam's. The staff is wonderful. The cooks are the greatest. The half bbq chicken with stuffing and mashed sweet potatoes is in the top 3 of my all time favorite meals. Along with in-n-out and Rojo's beer battered cod tacos. You should go just to try the sweet potatoes. Everything on the menu is good and reasonalby priced. One of Sam's owners opend Devil's Alley in the city so if you've been there expect even better and cheaper here. So what if it's not as hip on a crowded city street?  The time you spend looking for a parking spot you coulda drove the 20 minutes to jenkintown and parked here with ease.,2
5,This is a great beer distributor prices are very reasonable they don't overcharge you as the distributors in Philly I actually pay $10.00 less for a case of beer than what I've paid at the beer distributor in my neighborhood. I haven't gone anywhere else since they opened.,2
5,The hotel is clean and the staff very friendly and helpful. The room was spacious and the bed was very comfortable. The only negative I could find is  the lack of an elevator in the parking garage and no wifi.,2
5,"I worked with the Sultans of Schlep last week on a small move within center city. I had a great experience for a number of reasons:-Tom is extremely attentive, responsive, and easy to work with-They have fair prices-The movers were on time and worked efficiently-They provided wardrobe boxes at no extra cost-They have a cool and funny name (don't you think?)I would definitely work with them again!",2
3,The parking lot and the people surrounding it is a little scary.The store is limited in my opinion. Definitely has its pros and cons. I found out there is an app u can download to load digital coupons by that seems like it's all the perks they have.I was impressed that my nagger asked if I would like to have him load my bags in my car. Haven't had someone ask me that in a grocery store ever!They have the BEST fried chicken but when I got home I didn't think mine was very fresh like I'm  used to. Granted it was almost closing time they should have had it discounted in my opinion.,1
1,"Horrible buffet, they don't have enough toppings.. you have to wait for the pizza.. not recommend it for one hr. Lunch..",0
5,"I love love love facials with Becca at this beautiful spa. she is very professional and  knowledgeable on skincare along with Rescue's product lines. She makes me feel at very comfortable since I am seriously self conscience about my problematic broke out skin lately. I now use and purchased what Becca wrote out for me. Worth every penny; Lait U wash, PF50 toner, cream demopurifiante and mask vivant! She has given me hope again for clear skin! she also showed me how to apply with an upward motion and use baking soda once a week mixed with vivant for this face! Thank you Becca & Rescue see you all again soon! xoxo",2
1,"I've been to a lot of Pho Restaurant but this is the worst one.... I've been to this restaurant 2 times.... First experience, I would like to try the new place after porkie the Korean BBQ closed.....and they over charged the bill.....The bubble drink is supposed to be $3.50 but they add an extra $3.....When I asked why they said Oh it's because we put the tapioca.....The drink itself already serve w/ the tapioca; therefore I do not understand why the extra charge is necessary..... The second time, I gave another try......I went with 11 people and ordered their pho......I found out that the flanks were shining green.....which was clear to me that the meat quality is bad....it has FUNGI....they're ROTTEN!!!! The worst thing was that it was not only my bowls but also others....So we asked the server NICELY if we could just changed all to the rice dishes instead and pay the extra.....but the first thing they did, flew to the kitchen and brought us the rare flank and argue that the meat was fine.....Like duhhhh one bowl is ok but it's like all 8 BOWLS WITH ROTTEN MEAT!!!! Then the other server said, Oh I'm in charge and we couldn't change the food because it's already in the system....Excuse me, but I'm not there to eat for free and I said I'M GOING TO PAY FOR THE EXTRA CHARGES..... We dealt with this for more than 20 minutes....just want to proof that they were right.......clearly they had no idea how to dealt with their customers....NO APOLOGIZE...NOTHING AND JUST KEPT ARGUING.....Definitely the worst dinner ever.....and WOULD NOT RECOMMEND this place at all to anybody.....I believe that you do not want to pay for rotten meat.....Better go to Viet Huong or Nam Phuong across from them....it's way better with the same price, better food quality and better service!",0
4,"Damn good establishment tucked away in East Falls overlooking the Schuylkill. Service was good & the waitor was exceptionally knowledgable of menu. Good wine list and solid craft beer options on tap.Started w/ the meat and cheese plate of the waitors choice. High quality products, reasonably priced. Delicious. Ordered scallops w/ bacon and although the portion size was small for the price (should have been 3 scallops instead of 2), the dish was well done and worth a taste. Finished w/ a four cheese pizza which was the best made brick oven pizza i've ever had. Crispy, yet soft dough. Minimal grease. Just right.Absolutely reccomended.",2
1,Perfectly seasoned meatloaf. Too bad it was served cold w cold coffee.,0
5,"If you want stunning and unique pieces of jewelry, this is the place for it! The two marvelous owners, Ali and Albisia, are such sweet people. They create amazing jewelry that you really will have a hard time choosing from! I have a necklace, two bracelets, and a ring and am already hankering for more... There's also great music to add to the decor and general ambience of the store... and you get offered wine as you peruse! What can be better than that? Hope to visit Tampa again soon and see you guys soon!! :)",2
5,"This place is off the hook! One of the only places in the world where it's cool for a man to order a wine cooler. Little necks, Cesar salad, beef fat fries, baked chicken were all amazing. Must check this place out!",2
4,"Awesome brunch. About $35 for unlimited mimosas and Buffett. Buffett is on point with a full seafood bar (ahi tuna, crab legs, peel-n-eat shrimp, smoked salmon and more). Limited tapas style menu to order even more goodies from. I recommend you order the bananas foster over the Belgian waffles off the tapas menu: phenomenal!  And if the food and drinks don't sell you, the view and service should. Dining room has windows lining the back wall so you have a stellar view of the bay while you're dining. Our server, Jade was superb. I don't think my mimosa glass was ever empty!",2
4,We love AJ's! The specialty food selections are outstanding. We love to get a light dinner and eat on the patio. Tonight we enjoyed soup and salads. The service experience at the deli counter is sort of hit and miss. Tonight they were understaffed.  We will be back.,2
1,Got the special--mole chicken.  Terrible. I can't say enough bad things about it. What were they thinking???,0

5,"Perfectly fine, perfectly decent Cuban sandwiches made from boars head quality meat and other mass produced ingredients. For Florida this place is a tiny step up from most food options. None of the ingredients look to be made on site. Staff is perfectly fine and friendly. Seating is covered outdoor picnic benches, not filthy but not exactly clean. The view is of really pretty trees, grass and the road. Good for a quick bite on a nice day.My bias: I'm a city slicker and a bit of a foodie. If you're in the area and need a quick bite this is slightly better than the chains. At least your money supports some of the locals and a successful small business which are very hard to find in this part of the country. The rest goes to Sysco, where everyone orders their ingredients from.",2
5,"We stayed here for a long weekend last year. 2 kids, 1 a toddler and we had a great time. All the restaurants were good. My son and husband had fun at the arcade. Hubs enjoyed gambling. My favorite hotel in Reno.",2
4,"This place is hip.  Perhaps too hip for many over 35 but if you can tolerate the boisterous and extremely casually attired youth--I haven't worn a suit in 20 years either but even 20 year olds should have something besides skinny jeans and T-shirts with borderline obscene slogans in their closets--the food is worth it and the staff copes well.   I had a 6:00 reservation (obtained the day before) but the sky seemed threatening a downpour so I came early to avoid it and was seated 20 minutes or so before the appointed time.  I often don't even make reservations and have no trouble getting seated at popular places by being there when they open or, for those open all day, coming before the popular dinner hour, but that didn't work the day before at Lüke.  Even at 4:30 the place was packed so I did make one for the following day.My meal started with the crispy Brussel Sprouts.  Even if you hate Brussels sprouts (I like them), don't be afraid to try this dish--if no one told you you might not know what you were eating.  They are in some sort of sweet/sour sauce/dressing and fried both slightly blackened and crispy as advertised . . . tossed with almond slices, small bits of jalapeño and sprinkled with shavings of cheese on top.Then I had pork schnitzel and ""pommes frites"" (that's shoestring fries to the Galliphobes).  It came with whitish gravy in a pitcher, I suppose to make it ""Southern"".  The gravy was good but I skipped eating it, doing that the usual way with a squeeze of lemon.  It was excellent and the fries were fine too.I finished with some excellent decaf and a glass of Kahlua--I had had iced tea with the meal so some alcohol was not an excess.A lady who was some sort of hostess dropped by my table while I was eating to make sure everything was OK and when told I needed ketchup (for the fries), went and got me some (in a dainty little single-serve Heinz bottle).  My waiter also checked several times but didn't hover.I am giving it 4 stars.  The 5th star is withheld because of the crowded dining room and noise level . . . nothing to do with the food which I greatly enjoyed.",2
4,this is a great fabrics store...soooo much to choose from especially in the upholstery/decorating fabrics.i went in on vacation when i was visiting my family and found the best kitschy cowgirl fabric i have ever seen! it is definitely a go to place for beautiful fabrics but it is also nice to know that the southwestern fabrics they have also have some humor! the family who runs it has been there since i was a kid so it is a great Tucson business!  The special offer i was able to use made the price even better! although not all the staff was aware of it they honored it as a true/honest business should!I will definitely be back as soon as I am back in town!,2
5,"As good as it gets (in St. Louis)! (I've had better in larger cities, but I've been to most every other sushi place in STL and really liked Kampai.)Me and two friends came here last night (on a Tuesday night) for the first time. The restaurant was mostly empty, maybe five tables filled at most throughout our time there. Service was attentive and helpful.I had the chirashi ($20, great food, but too much for one person; get it and share), another friend had a shrimp tempura roll and a spicy tuna roll ($15 total), and the third friend had a vegetarian roll and a veggie hand roll ($15 total). I also got the spicy tuna salad to go at the end of the meal. Most all rolls were under $10, with just a few at $11-14.The spicy tuna hand roll looked divine to me, but it had ""too much"" raw spicy tuna for my friend. In other words, big pieces of spicy tuna, not just little pieces like you normally get in rolls. My other friend seemed completely happy with his vegetarian rolls.The chirashi had a huge variety (one piece of each): salmon, smoked salmon, smoked albacore, raw albacore, ahi tuna, mackerel, shrimp, octopus, and probably some others that I'm forgetting. I also tried the uni (sea urchin), which was interesting, but I don't think the texture is for me.Surprisingly (in comparison to other reviews), we didn't get any warm hand towels. I got both miso soup and ginger salad, whereas my friends just got miso soup (maybe the complementary items depend on what you buy?). I didn't pay too much attention to the menu, though. I did order hot tea, and they had to keep refilling my cup instead of just bringing me a pot, so I guess a pot would have been nice.In general, I was pleasantly surprised by Kampai's variety and chef's tasting menu - neither of which I've seen at other sushi places. I'll be back and might even venture to try the most expensive ($80) chef's menu.And there is FREE (yes, FREE!) PARKING for Kampai in the garage right next to it. Go in and turn to your left. On quick glance, I think there are 10 spots designated for Kampai. If those are full, I guess you're out of luck and have to park on the street. (We managed to snag a free spot, making the whole experience pain free.)Delivery, take out, and catering, too - which I'll definitely keep in mind for the future!",2
5,Just left Reeds. It was one of the best meals I have had.  I had the pork cheek which I have never had before but it was wonderful. The pork belly was very good.  The wine was excellent.  The atmosphere was very comfortable. Pork loin was just as good.  The mixed drinks were excellent.  I will return.,2
4,"I have never ""Dined In"" but get carryout pizza at Luca's regularly.  Pizza is great and they are always extremely friendly/courteous... Usually even throw in an order or two of garlic knots and marinara sauce on the house.. Definitely one of the better pizza places in Telford/Souderton area...",2
4,Shout out to the Peanut Butter Cookie Cream Pie shake bro. That's what I am talking about. So simple...so good. I'd get that again and again.,2
5,"Delicious mimosas, among other things. Went with girlfriends. Three ordered the crabmeat omelette and all raved about it. I had eggs with tortillas, black beans and rice. It was delicious. Good service, good food, good prices. We'll be back.",2
5,Parking lot was a bit small and crowded (a good sign).  I was greeted and brought directly to my table immediately (I did make a reservation).  I ordered the Chicken/Filet Tapanyaki with an avocado roll. Salad was a bit too garlicky for my taste.  Soup was hot and tasty (metal spoon and not a traditional spoon).  Avocado Roll was great!Dinner - Good show.  Very personable chef.  Talented.  Fried rice is the norm (no upcharge).  Veggies were hot and still crunchy.,2
5,"My husband and I eat at Molldeli about once a week, marking it one of our favorite lunch spots. We're kind of food snobs, and we find it to be a great experience all around. The restaurant was purchased by its current owner maybe 6 months ago, and it has certainly changed for the better. The menu is now chef inspired, with the specials truly highlighting the talented kitchen. But quite honestly, both my husband and I have our favorites on the regular menu, so we rarely even make it to the special board. We all know the foundation of a great sandwich is delicious bread, and Molldelli has certainly figured that out... both the regular hoagie roll and the wheat roll are fantastic. My husband's favorite sandwich is the hot salami (but do be warned... it is super spicy), and I adore the chicken club. But lately we've both been fixated on the buffalo chicken salad. It's so good! You know when you order a salad and the ratio of lettuce to toppings is off? That's very much not the case with this salad - you have plenty of toppings from start to finish. The only change we make to it is having the chicken served hot (on the menu, it's cold). It's just a personal preference, but for us, it makes it just slightly better. No matter what you order at Molldeli, you will have a great food experience. They appeal to all customers, having both the traditional and more daring menu items available. I agree with the sign - best sandwiches, off The Hill!",2
5,I went here for my first time today.   The burgers exploded with flavor.  Well worth 5 stars.  The custard in the turtle sundae was amazing!  I had the double bacon cheese. So GOOD and the employees are very friendly!,2
3,"I'm only able to comment on takeout, but plan to eat in at some point.Pros: Looks clean, nice people, tasty food.Coins: A big pricier/smaller portions than other Japanese/Chinese places in the area. Still, super convenient because I live a few blocks away.",1
5,"This is some good motherfuckin ice cream.Positive:+Tell me you're serving bananas foster today!+Freshly made waffle cones+Establishment doesn't look like a fucking kindergarden.  I can eat ice cream and still feel like an adult+Owner is a Harvard grad, but isn't a stuck up asshole.  Actually seems pretty down to earth and can hold a conversation with the layman.Negative:-I'm reaching, but I kinda wish this place was located by the movie theater.  Would be nice to park once and make this part of an evening out.  The only time I really think about this place is after rolling out of Publix and by then I've already got bags of frozen food thawing out and dont have time for ice cream.  Not even some bad ass ice cream.Hey... even 5 star joints could use some constructive criticism",2
2,"This was my first time coming to this restaurant. My husband and I decided to stop by after seeing that it had decent reviews and 2 other places we stopped by had long wait times. When we first got there, there was no dedicated hostess to take our names and as a result we stood there trying to get someone's attention for over 5 minutes. When the waitress finally put our name down she told us that there was a 45-60 minutes wait, which we agreed with. However, when I looked around I counted 5 tables that were empty but no one had cleaned them off. This was the major issue with this restaurant: there was no defined organization. The waiters were also the hostesses and had to bus tables and since they were busy none of them could do any of their roles well. When we were finally seated after 1 hour 15 minutes, we placed our order (we had plenty of time to determine what we wanted) and for spoons for our coffee since the waitress forgot to bring us some. She returned with 1 spoon and said that they were still washing dishes. When she finally brought the 2nd spoon it had milk still on it and some fuzz on it. I had never experience such disorder at any restaurant I've been to before. The only saving grace was that the food was decent, it didn't look pretty but it tasted well. It is only because of the food that I gave this restaurant 2 stars because the service and wait time were horrendous.",0
5,"I went last night with a few friends and let me say I was impressed, not necessarily with the quality of the food (nothing wrong with it by any means) or the decor, but the servers: how they don't kill every 4th customer is beyond me. I heard tables on both sides of us giving the most ridiculous of complaints to our/their server. Both tables were demanding as hell and already said loudly to eachother that they weren't tipping because of x, y and z reasons, and then were dumbfounded that there's a gratuity on their bill (it says it in the menu, anything over $50) their server, smaller girl so with purple hair, carried upwards of 4 plates at once, explained the menu perfectly and had an eagle eye for every table in her section and dealt with ridiculous complaints like a true professional. Thumbs up and five stars to the staff, customers, learn how to be basic humans, or stay home.",2
1,"When I think about the time I spent waiting for the server to arrive, for a drinkable cup of coffee to replace the one that tasted like it has been brewed with a goat's hoof, and to digest the hard lump of cheese and egg that was my breakfast, I really wish I had chosen instead to stand in the line-up at Sugarbowl.",0
5,Best pizza in reno.  We came across this place when looking on yelp for a new pizza place. The pizza is so good and they deliver fast. Just goes to show little whole in the wall places are the best.,2
4,"I assumed brews meant beer  once I got over that I appreciated the Donuts. I mean Donuts and beer would seriously be the greatest  pairing since PB&J. My friends assumed beer also. We came for beer and stayed for the Donuts which were amazing and giant but it wasn't memorable amazing it was ""ohh these are giant donuts they made in front of me. Me and friends ordered different ones so we could sample each others. The establishment was cool but again I repeat there are no beers. Just nice people and Donuts.",2
5,"I had a random day off so, while I made other stops, grabbing a Kien Giang banh mi for lunch was really the sole purpose for my 1.5 hour drive to Nashville. It's that good. I've only tried a handful of other items, but they were all also very tasty. Another bonus: I could certainly do it.. but spending $25 for food and drinks for two would be a stretch. Also, they only take cash or checks so be prepared.",2
5,"I really like this boba tea place, especially their rose oolong tea. the bobas are soft (but not too soft) and chewy. I stop by every time I crave for boba tea. Also, their egg puff is good too! You can have it with or without ice cream.",2
5,"The accolades for milk tooth keep rolling in as they continue to impress locally and nationally. I can't believe that it took indy this long to have such an amazing brunch place. Is it only a southern thing? I don't have much more to say that hasn't already been. But, chef Brooks and his whole team are doing brunch right and I hope indy treasures this local gem. I have long warranted this spot as a special occasion or celebratory meal but I think that the prices are incredibly accessible. I have never wanted to change anything to a dish I've had here so the complaints of that not being welcome don't ring true for me. Everything I have had here has been spectacular. The pastries and bakes goods are to die for. The coffee and concoctions from I believe the only mod bar in indy is superb. The sides are the highlights and the revolving menu never has disappointed. The staff and help are incredibly friendly. Especially the hostess. I salute you milk tooth you make indy a better place. (Tips)Closed on Tuesdays!Sorghum bacon, grits fully loaded, citrus glazed donut, all coffee, tea fried chicken)",2
4,One of my favorite spots for coffee and donuts in NOLAParking space available if you're driving.Very friendly staff. Quick service.One caveat- the backyard space is a great addition but they keep the trash close to that area and it smells really really bad.  Otherwise I would have given a 5 star review,2
4,"Not an expansive menu, but for what this restaurant does offer it pulls off with success. Very much recommend the roti chanai.",2
4,"Service and food were great.  I had the catfish nuggets for an appetizer and BBQ shrimp for dinner.  The shrimp was really good with a lot of garlic an a little kick, plus it was already pealed and ready to eat.",2
1,"Unfortunately, I'm NOT happy after coming to this salon yet again. I got a message from the owner saying he'd like to have me come in to receive a FREE service because they previously ruined my hair. So, I thought since he's the owner my hair would turn out good but I was wrong. I'm really unhappy with this whole experience. I showed him multiple photos on google of what I wanted done to my hair which was a lot of blonde. I told him I do not want any ORANGE in my hair as I wanted a ""white blonde"". He said you won't have any orange in your hair. I have a message from him the OWNER saying I would receive a FREE service if I deleted my previous review. He should of NEVER offered a free service if it wasn't really free! So, I said how much because I thought I was getting my hair done for free. He said since your hair is long and thick you'll have to pay for the hair color and ""medicine"" but he won't charge me for his time. I said ok how much he said $80. He said it would cost me $180 if he didn't give me a discount which is very pricey. He put a lot of highlights on my hair and worked quickly as he seemed to want to rush on my hair which I do not like. My hair is important to me, I don't want my hair to fall out. He said this medicine he's gonna put on my hair is $50 for a treatment and that I needed it because of the blonde going on my hair which I know any coloring is damaging and blonde is very damaging but he said he charges everyone who gets hair color for this so called medicine which they mix into the color you dye your hair. You can purchase the entire set online (3 bottles) for $75 which is supposed to give you like 15 applications so he's definitely charging a lot of money! He only put No.1 on my hair and not No.2 or No.3. He also had a lady (the receptionist) wash out my hair? Ok, even though she was nice why would he have her do that when she said she knows nothing about hair because I asked if she's styling my hair and she said she doesn't do hair and I wouldn't want her to do my hair. As I was waiting there was a lady next to me, she got her hair cut and a perm. She was done but she wasn't happy, she told the lady she didn't like the hair cut and she had her style it more and trim off a little more but the lady still wasn't happy. The girl told the client when she washes her hair it will be better.. um how? I know she left very unhappy! Also the lady behind me was getting her hair cut and when he (the owner) was done cutting her hair she looked in the mirror and wanted it different and styled different so that made me have to wait longer but 2 clients were not happy and also myself. That's not a good look TJ nail and spa! I had a towel on my head and waited about 30 mins just to get my hair blow dried because he was cutting another clients hair. I seen orange roots, I was mad!!! He finally came over and I said I don't like the orange color on my roots, can you put a toner on my hair and he said it's not orange it's the lighting. The lighting?! It wasn't the lighting! He proceeds to blow dry hair and then starts straighten it without asking me if I wanted it straightened or curled, you are supposed to pick how you want your hair styled. At that point I knew my hair wasn't what I wanted and it wasn't gonna be fixed even if I wanted it too. I just sat there in the hair, mad and yet again very disappointed! I looked in the mirror and seen my hair damaged and brittle, orange and brassy and not even close to what I wanted. There goes my money down the drain, yet again. I will not be back to get my hair ruined and he made me delete my previous review which was also 0-1 stars before I left his salon but I had to write this one, this is real, this is honest, beware of getting your hair completely ruined and nothing close to what you want! Like I said I showed the OWNER multiple photos and I stated I did NOT want any orange on my hair but I did have orange on my hair, I didn't get what I wanted like he said, he said he doesn't mess up, he's been doing hair for years. As a salon owner I think he should take the time to really do what the client wants and achieve what the client wants done to their hair, if the workersowner would do that then there shouldn't be any bad reviews but there is so that shows you they do not care, not even the owner cares. They just want to rush and get done to get paid, they don't care if the customer is happy or not. There are more bad reviews from people going to this salon and having horrible experiences but he is bribing people to delete their bad reviews because he told me the bad reviews is hurting his business which is why people do reviews, to let people know this place is awesome or this place is horrible, beware, stay away. I do reviews to let people know the good, the bad and the ugly. I do reviews anywhere and I'm always 100% honest. So, if bad reviews hurt his business that is all on him and his employees not me or anyone else.",0
5,"Best meal enjoyed when traveling to Tennessee. Smart eclectic flavors make the sandwiches a real hit. I loved the smoked turkey and a side of the roasted carrots. Finished off with the apple ricotta cake perfect indulgence without the guilt. Cool interiors, too.",2
5,Awesome cookie!  Highly recommend this place!  It was the best cookie ever.  It's in a great location with lots of things to do around.,2
2,"So so disappointing. Went there twice and each time I said I'd never go there again. The first time wasn't good. BUT they were new and I gave them a second chance. And I'll never go there again. Only over-priced mediocre food. Except the Brussels sprouts. They are delicious. And the cocktails. Had a fabulous blackberry bourbon + bubbly drink. But everything else is just meh. I've tried the meatballs, burger, Korean fried chicken sandwich, butternut squash bbq sandwich (slimy and seriously gross), and the pimento cheese broccoli sandwich. I really tried. And tasted. And tried again. And I won't go back. Just not worth it for the money.",0
5,I love this hotel. A friend found it for me because I got stuck in a storm and could keep driving. Everyone here made me feel very comfortable and at home. They set me up with laundry and even treated me to a cup of coffee. I had dinner at the Taproom on the $3 craft brew night and was very happy with the selection of local craft brew. The room was comfortable and I slept very well. I would love to stay another night!,2
5,"A disclaimer: I only had their beer, did not dine here.I think this was the best brewery we went to on a three day trip to Tucson, and coincidentally it was the busiest one. Finding a seat here took some serious time but one thing we did notice is that no matter how busy they were, the servers were always available and ready to help. There was no feeling whatsoever that we were being rushed, or couldn't get service. It was just that everyone was good at their jobs!The NCAAle, an English Strong Ale, was glorious. Nothing like a 10oz glass of strong ale to wake you up when you get that 2:30 feeling from your sugar crash. The patio is a nice place to sit and offers a nice view of the Tucson ""skyline"" while you drink. Loved this place!",2
2,"Service, if there are more than two or three customers, tends to be chaotic and inefficient, a little amateurish, although reasonably friendly. The clientele--the people who come banging through the front door (consider fixing the door so that it opens and closes easily)--can be boorish and uncivilized. I have at times felt uncomfortable around them. The interior looks unfinished, and has a threadbare feel. I feel like a few tweaks--I don't know: fresh paint? a few pieces of new furniture?--could make the place a little less uninviting. The location is unfortunate, there on Chelten just off Wayne, steeped in the exhaust fumes of fast-food franchises and with everything around rather depressing, but that's not Enterprise's fault.",0
2,"Well, well.... Where do I start with this place? First time experience, went in with my partner.Walking in at about 7:30 on a Friday night (st paddys day weekend even)  and the  place had about 4 customers. That should have been my first clue as to what our experience was going to be like.We seated ourselves and the waitress, an older gal maybe mid to late 40's who had greasy stringy unwashed hair and rotting teeth came up and took our drink order. My girlfriend got a Dr. Pepper and I got a water. She brought out Coke instead of DP. No biggie. We let it go, assuming it was an honest mistake. After about 10 minutes she returns and we order a 12 piece ""jumbo"" wing basket ($11.99), a 6 piece($7.99), and a beer batter sampler($11.99). 20 minutes pass and finally here comes our appetizer. The waitress throws the basket of appetizers on the table  and says ""here's your food."" Very flat with a big attitude and walks off. The beer battered mushrooms were doughy and undercooked. We had a single half full ranch cup to share between us for the big platter and she avoided our table when she saw we needed more.***let me note that this waitress is giving the customers at the 3 tables surrounding us WAY better customer service. Even brought their food out in a timely manner with no attitude whatsoever.I decide to let the mushrooms slide for the moment. I used to work in a restaurant and I understand that mistakes happen, however this far into the experience I'm being mighty generous since it's a first time experience.We finish our appetizer and we wait and wait and wait and finally she comes by and takes the platter returning 10 minutes later with our wings. She makes no inquiry about the broken open, clearly undercooked, mushrooms still sitting on the platter.I got the 12 piece with a single half full ranch. Again. Food on the table, doesn't ask if we need anything else which is something she is doing for other customers. at this point we have been here for about 40 minutes.I got half regular and half thai flavor. The wings were NOT jumbo. They were puny. The flavor was good for the thai, and the waitress even stopped by to check up on us, though I wouldn't consider walking by quickly and saying in your flat attitude tone ""youguysdoingalright?okaycool."" Really all that helpful since she came and went so fast it took me a second to understand her. I had to reiterate for my girlfriend.  When I started on the regular I bit into my drumstick and had to fish a feather out of my mouth. DISGUSTING. It was that point that the entire experience was completely and thoroughly unacceptable.  The wings were soggy because they batter them or something on top of all that.  At first I had no plans other than to pay for the meal and leave the waitress 2 pennies and be on my merry way. But when the waitress came and asked if we needed a box I said no with 6 wings still on my plate, OBVIOUS SOMETHING WAS WRONG, again. She was going to take my stuff and make no inquiry to right the situation. I asked for the manager. Took a minute but finally the manager came over (mind you it is still pretty dead, what are these people doing I wonder?) I explained the food issues but blew off bringing up our treatment by the waitress. Normally I give the benefit of the doubt on this one but it was blatantly obvious that we were being treated differently with a different attitude than other patrons because we are a same-sex couple. Like our table had a contagious disease that prevented us from getting food in a timely manner, and getting drink and condiment refills too, regardless of the *empty* cups on the edge of the table. It wasn't like we were off in the distance. She had to walk by our table every time to communicate with the surrounding tables.Anyways. The manager experience wasn't the greatest, but I wasn't going to pay for that meal after the feather thing, and she comped everything. BUT only after slightly arguing with us about the undercooked mushrooms, which by the way come frozen which  makes the fact that they weren't cooked all the way acceptable I guess? Don't know. Don't care. I WILL NOT BE GOING BACK!!!2 stars because they did comp the meal, the waitress got lucky. If I would have had to pay for anything she wouldn't have gotten a tip due to the attitude but we left her $4 anyway since we didn't have to pay for the meal.  THAT IS THE ONLY REASON.1 star though for the overall experience. Same-sex couples, steer clear. You aren't welcome there and it's obvious.",0
4,"Nice bar to relax, smoke a cigar and enjoy a drink. My bartender, Adrian, made me a fantastic dirty martini.",2
5,I really enjoy this Mexican restaurant because it's Close to the house and we always have great service. The cheese sauce is good and the margaritas are tasty. This is the 1st place I have ever had tortilla chicken soup. It is really good. Chicken broth with chicken rice pico and fresh avocados on top. It's a huge bowl.  Their tacos are great too.,2
5,"Arcadia Landscape is a great locally owned company. I would recommend this company to family, friends, and any local business owners. Their work is high quality, and they stand behind their product.",2
4,"It was your average target experience.  The staff at this target were very nice.  Most of the staff I ran into greeted me with a smile and a ""Do you need help?"".  Store was clean and organized.  Parking was easy.I gave it 4 stars because the water selection was almost completely gone.  Shelves were nearly empty and selection was sorely lacking.",2
4,"I stayed at the Hotel Monaco on a recent visit to Philadelphia and I was impressed with almost everything. Everywhere I went in the hotel itself, staff were happy, friendly, and welcoming. This wasn't the case only with me and it did not come across as fake or forced. I am a people watcher, so I observed the staff interacting with several guests and they were consistently good service providers. The Red Owl Tavern has great food, and generally great service, but while I was there for brunch, there was one server behind the ready-to-eat bar in the Tavern that was in a bad mood, unfriendly, aloof, or some combination of all three. She did not acknowledge people when they ordered-she would just turn around and start getting what they asked for. She also got into it with another server who apparently experienced the same rude attitude I and my fellow patrons did. I cannot emphasize enough that almost every other person there had a great attitude and was more than friendly. One bad apple...ironic since she has red hair. I realize that the Tavern is likely under different management, but it does affect a hotel guest's experience, and in my case, it did so negatively. The only reason I can't give the hotel 5 stars, however, has nothing to do with the Tavern. It is because our room was not touched once we checked in. Not one time. It was immaculate upon arrival, but that was the last time I saw it that way. I shouldn't have to call the front desk for either a daily once-over or turn-down service. To be fair, I in fact did not call the front desk, because I was running around almost the whole time I was in Philadelphia, but that's exactly why I wanted to come back to a tidied room. This is an oversight I did not expect from such a great chain. The Monaco included all of the amazing features of a Kimpton hotel. My dog was warmly greeted everywhere we went in the hotel, her dog bed and bowls were already in the room, and the decor was, as always, remarkable, interesting, and quirky. The staff was unbelievably friendly and helpful, and the complimentary drinks in the morning and for happy hour don't hurt!Overall, probably one of the best places to stay in Philadelphia. It's a new hotel, so I'm sure the housekeeping issue will be addressed in time. Just growing pains.",2
1,"I haven't seen the book, but I think hotchickswithdouchebags.com is a hilarious website that.... Oops!  I forgot - this is a review for Pearl... in my defense, it's very easy to confuse the two.I went to Pearl to see a DJ who I'd enjoyed at Silk City, but it was choch central and after one overpriced drink both my wallet and my soul were hurting.",0
4,"Ace hotel is one of my favorite places in the city.  It has it all.  It reminds me of Miami, I'm not sure why, but it does.  The vibe is a bit more sheek and upscale.  I know its New Orleans and anything goes but please don't show up in shorts and flip flops.  Prices are high but you get what you pay for, go to bourbon street if you want jello shots. I haven't stayed in the rooms, this review is specifically for the bars.  Because well...I drink, not sleep.The hotel is huge.  Its in a prime location too. There are 4 bars and several event rooms spread throughout.Lobby Bar is the main bar.  It has great drinks. Happy Hour with a limited menu of drinks and bar snacks (get some meatballs).  Although the space is large, it can be difficult to get a drink, the bar itself is not too big and service is slow - mainly due to the craft cocktails.  The decor is open, minimal seating, sort of sleek, mid century.  Three Keys is a hidden music space that opens up at night.  They have a weekly calendar or events that play here.  Some have amazed me.  Everything from folk music to 80s/90s DJ.  The vibe is different any given night.  Wednesday tends to be a good crowd, especially during spring wednesday in the square concert series.  Josephine Estella has a bar as well.  This bar is faster but has a different menu and isn't as loungy.  You feel like you're in a restaurant - not a bar. Happy Hour 2-5pm Daily Alto is their rooftop pool which is such a hot spot, I've yet to be able to get in... Seaworthy also has a bar.  Happy Hour 2-5pm Daily.  I've yet to go.",2
4,"It was a quick and efficient service visit, in and out in about an hour or less with John Cowell of Crown Honda Pinellas Park just off US 19. Thank you John for taking care of my car.",2
5,"This Chipotle location was great! I wanted to thank Chipotle for recognizing teachers for Teacher Appreciation Week! The line was very small and they served quickly as a pose to another location that had the line wrapped around the store! Their food is always fresh, tasteful and fulfilling! My go to is always the bowl with white cilantro lime rice,black beans, steak and all the toppings! Must eat with a bag of fresh tortilla chips!!",2
3,"This was my first time to Whitebox after seeing it in friends posts. Upon walking in I felt that even though it's very white and modern from a design perspective, it still felt warm and welcoming. The employees working all had a smile on their faces and were pleasant to interact with. You order at the counter and then choose a seat and they will bring your food / drinks to you. The best part of my meal was definitely the latte. It was delicious and I liked that you could order a 12oz or 16oz. I ordered the Quiche Lorraine for brunch. It is served with a small arugula salad. The quiche is served room temperature, but mine was cold like it had been in a refrigerator. I asked to have it warmed up and it came back at about the same temperature. It was ok, but there is definitely better quiche to be had in StL. The arugula salad was entirely forgettable. I also ordered one biscuit with gravy on the side to try. The biscuit was a lot bigger than I was expecting. Neither the eggs in the quiche or the biscuit were very fluffy - they were both much denser than I would have expected. While I enjoyed my overall experience I felt the food was overpriced.",1
5,Stayed at the Peppermill for the Vietnam Helicopter Association Reunion. The rooms were wonderful as was the dining experiences. We will definitely stay again when we are in the Reno area.,2
3,Mediocre at best. Food is not bad but it also is not the best. Nothing to come running back too. But if friends or coworkers invite me then ill go again.,1
3,"Harry's blue bell is a nice spot. We stopped a few days ago for a quick dinner. It's tucked in the corner of a shopping center and it's very easy to miss. It was packed and seemed like the place to be for locals. The inside is nice but small, only a few tables in the entire place. The service was just okay. The beer selection is very good as are the prices on the beer. The food menu was a bit limited with you're basic bar food. The wife went with the bbq pulled pork and I went with the chicken and honey mustard wrap. The bbq pork was good, the bun was nicely toasted but the sauce was overly sweet for our liking. The wrap was fresh and good but nothing spectacular. The fries were hot and crispy. The kale slaw was fantastic but a very small portion.Overall it was a decent meal. I wouldn't go out of my way to go back. If I were in the area I'd stop though. Solid 3 stars.",1
3,Good selection of food but too pricey for what it really is all about. The interior is nice and good service. Just too pricey.,1
1,"I could just copy and paste the majority of the reviews into this box, but I guess I will share my experience first hand.At first, I thought it was a farmers market. I texted my friend asking her what time we should go so I knew when to cook dinner and she told me to hold off dinner - I was going to get stuffed at this event.She was dead wrong.When we arrived around 7:30 we found it super packed. Long long times, tight crowds, lots of dogs and babies. We circled the event trying to pick out which line we were going to devote our entire night to standing in, and decided on the Jamaican truck. After an hour of standing in line, and having other line go-ers friends casually jip us, we finally made it to the front to order only to have the vendor announce they were out of all of my meal options.So you know what I had for dinner the evening of Night Market? A bag of chips from CVS.This event had it's potential. But I guess they were not counting on the ridiculous horde of hungry people. Most trucks were placing ""SOLD OUT"" signs just as we were arriving. There were very few vegetarian/vegan options... (actually, don't believe any food vendors had vegan options). Hopefully next time they will be able to work out their kinks.",0
3,"Why is it that ALL Anthros have dressing rooms that seem lit by a candle on the verge of flickering out?  The longer dresses on the first floor are usually amazing.  The rest...well, there are no must-have items anymore. Lack of essential wearability/usefulness seems to be hitting a lot of women's clothing stores these days.",1
4,"I called to schedule a recally repair on my car. The receptionist was extremely friendly and the dealership was able to book my appointment for a week later. That was perfect for me because it gave me time to arrange alternate transportation to/from work. Dropping it off is a cinch. You pull into the garage, get out, and check-in. Easy enough. They called the same afternoon, around 3, to let me know that the car was finished. Unfortunately, that was my late night working, so I had to wait until the next morning to pick it up. Getting the car back was the same story. Very nice, courteous staff all around.I like that my 21-point check came back without any recommendations. My car has a fair amount of mileage on it, so I was expecting there to be something. The fact that there wasn't anything indicates to me that there is honesty with the office.The only negative thing I can say is that my parking space hang tag disappeared after our service, but I think it was mistakenly thrown out with the service hang tag. No biggie since we were able to get our pass easily replaced.I would definitely consider bringing my car back here for service since the location is convenient for me and the service was great!I think the previous less-than-stellar reviews were probably due to bringing cars in during recall high season. My notices were almost expired, so maybe that's the difference.Maybe I'll give them a look for my next car purchase ;)",2
1,I'd give zero stars if I could. Employee in drive thru couldn't seem to get the simplest order right. Gave her my card for payment and she reappears 15 minutes later to collect payment. WTF? After a half hour wait my drinks were left off the order with said employee informing me that I didn't order drinks. That's the last time I'll be going there.,0
1,"I would not recommend using Alexander Bourne or Patina Shoe Parlor for any service. This ""business man"" is not who or what he claims to be. He is not nice, professional, or reliable. I am baffled at this man's success within the local community; all things come to the light eventually. My personal headache with this I met the ""proprietor"" out last summer, he was a nice enough guy, we had a bunch of mutual acquaintances. When he told me what he did, as shoe junkie I was happy to support a young local business as I too have a young local business, and strongly believe in supporting young entrepreneurs and craftsmen. Fast forward to January, when I called to have my shoes picked up, as Patinas had transitioned into a mobile service. Alexander came to my house at 8am to pick up my shoes that needed repair; five pairs (4 heels, one pair of flats). He requested I pay upfront, being that it was early in the morning, we had numerous mutual contacts, and he is a young business with hesitation agreed. Thankfully I wrote a check tragically it was for nearly $250. What I was told I was buying was a six pair sole and heel package, the remaining pair I could call in at any time. A receipt would be emailed to me, and my shoes would be done in 10-14 days.10 days later I call to inquire about my shoes, they are not ready. Day 14, I get voicemail. Day 20 I get hung up on. This persisted. I sent emails, Facebook messages, texts. I get no response. Eventually I get a weird and vague communication from Alexander's ""assistant"". Nothing is resolved, and then I am blocked from any means of contacting the business and its owner. In March 3 months later I run into Alexander, we have a hostile and rude exchange. He proceeded to call me a peon and other nasty names, denying having my shoes. In April I see this individual at another event, he laughs as I walk away knowing good and well what is up. Literally as I am prepping to sue this questionable character calls, yep I was that upset he calls and claims there was a mix up, he indeed has my shoes and will drop them off later that day. I give him my work address via a text and email. No response. He shows up the next morning, doesn't say a word and shows me the 4 heels he has repaired. The work is not bad, I have had much better work done elsewhere without the drama. I inquire about my gold flats, give a description and am told he would look for them, No apology, no explanation given, nothing. I get an email asking for the shoes to be described, which I find odd considering that I just did this, and that I would get an apology letter later in the day. In my response I suggest a refund, my other shoes found/returned or replaced, only to be answered with ""I never had your flats, and a link to his website. No apology, no receipt. Funny, he doesn't have my flats like he didn't have my shoes, like he did not remember who I was in March before he decided I was all these terrible random things, and cursed me out. The lies, deception and utter disregard for customer service and human decency is too much.  I responded professionally requesting a refund, shoes replacement, receipt, and apology. I got zero response. This whole exchange was really frustrating, and unprofessional. At this point I am out a pair of flats, it's not the end of the world but it is disappointing. It's unfortunate that someone feels entitled to treat others in this fashion, to deceive and steal.While I am elated that I have my heels back, the reality the work Bourne did was mediocre and his customer service is HORRIBLE! I will chalk this up as a lesson to be careful who I choose to do business with. Research everyone, and do not use Alexander Bourne or Patina Shoe Parlor for ANY  service. You will be disappointed, ripped off and or treated poorly. Just go elsewhere and save yourself the trouble.",0
5,"I went to the Screamery today with my daughter and her boyfriend, and I was pleased to hear that they are looking at a second location closer to me.  The service was excellent.  We were immediately asked if we had ever been there, and when we said no, we were given the run down on how the ice cream is made, and invited to try as many flavors as we wanted.  The owner also had a conversation with us telling us where the grass fed milk was from, and their overall story.  I also found out that you can get the ""game day"" ice cream at Sentential Peak Brewery, which is closer to me as well.  The ice cream was rich and decadent.  I had the sweet cream honeycomb, and the mudd pie.  Both amazing!!  The kind that I want to be alone with and savor every bit -  don't talk to me while I eat this!  MMM!!  And it's actually good for you!!",2
5,I have red pinstripes in my blood.  Let's rule the NL East again Phils ... and maybe this year the dice will roll in our favor all the way to a parade on Broad Street.  And to my favorite Phillie - Cliff Lee .... I wouldn't mind another seven shutouts this year as well.,2
5,"This is a great market. The beat I've been to in the city. The mixture of stalls is wonderful, between fresh vegetables, meat, eggs, as well as farm produce like cheese, honey, and cider, and baked goods, fresh teas and coffees (available iced for those summer days). The Big Cheese is great -- there's always a line of people hungry for possibly the beat grilled cheese I've ever tasted. I also enjoyed scones and shortbread from Queen's Cuisine. Bread from Companion Bakery is a must, as are popsicles from Whisk. There's a great atmosphere here on a Saturday morning. I also can recommend the free yoga (with a donation). A great teacher and good atmosphere.",2
5,"A few years ago when the cupcake store boom hit the valley, my Mom and I went on a cupcake tour and tried many different businesses out. Sugar Rush was one of our first stops on our quest for quality cupcakes, and we were not disappointed. The service is very friendly and you can tell they take pride in their flavors and presentation. Fast forward to now: There were a few birthdays coming up in my family and after spending lots of money on Christmas gifts, I wanted to keep it simple and affordable. Sugar Rush is very close to my house, so I thought, why not get everyone some beautiful gourmet cupcakes and a nice card? Boom~ easy, awesome gift! I went in and was greeted by a nice woman who was happy to answer any questions I had. After browsing all of the flavors (There are a lot! Something for everybody!) I ended up buying all of their margarita cupcakes, because that flavor was my favorite out of all the ones I tried a few years ago. I love that they have containers for just 1 or 2 cupcakes, perfect for gifts. My family members loved their cupcakes upon seeing them and said they were delicious! Of course, I had to get one for myself....It was just as yummy as I remember. I will definitely be back for more!",2
4,Overall the meal was fulfilling. It was a bit on the salty side for my liking but the size of the portions and flavor makes up for it. My favorites are the clams w/black bean sauce and mi xao gion (crispy fried noodle w/sauce? idk the Chinese translation). Service was average.,2
2,"Service was fine (other than our dirty appetizer plates sitting stacked at the end of the table throughout our meal) - Had the mac and cheese appetizer arrived before we placed our order, we probably would have left - Mac and cheese had odd plastic-y taste - Crab cake was bland - seared tuna should have come on a smaller plate (three slices of tuna on top of rice on one side of a rectangular plate) - we ordered a chicken soup to go and had to throw it out when we arrived at our destination because the cardboard cover had popped off the hot cup - pear crisp was the best part - $4 cup of coffee was tepid, at best",0
5,Second time here and just as great! All around one of the best BBQ places. The brisket was absolutely perfect this time also. Took my girlfriend this time and she was equally impressed.,2
5,Moving into our new house and I think the Italian hoagie saved my life. Happy to be living close.Just ate lunch from there again today. 2 days in a row!,2
5,Always hot & i'm always left satisfied. The hot wings are addictive! The ghetto punch is amazing!,2
2,We have been coming here for a couple of years.. but the last three things at this location things have gotten progressively worse.. we came here this last week and was greeted and sat.. the waiter took our order for hummus and beer and pizza.. after a wait(I know how much it takes being here before) we got our pizza and beer but no hummus.. had to ask for napkins.. then I asked for a to go beer(I love New Orleans) but after a 10 minute wait no beer.. at least they didn't charge us for it..so we left.. and we won't be back sadly.. we used to love this place but we will take our business elsewhere,0
4,Great cocktails....music wonderful....small plates which was perfect.  We had the meat and cheese plate and the pork belly...both delicious.  The cocktail I had was the day's riff...bartenders improvisation.... delicious,2
5,"4 weeks ago I answered an add looking for women to enter into a 6 week challenge. I saw it as an opportunity to get back on track and maybe spend some time on myself. I really am absolutely impressed with Becky and her Fox Fitness workouts. Although she makes you work, the workouts (interval &  buddy) are fun and over before you notice it. I look forward to going each week, am getting ME back and am noticing changes already. Her help with nutrition is a bonus! I encourage anyone of any level who is looking for something new, meet new people, improve your strength and improve your nutrition to come check out Fox Fitness!",2
1,"DO NOT GO THERE . The male waiter was only looking at my 7 year old daughter and I tried to get his attention  away but couldn't, a real creeper. The cook in the back looked in our direction and laughed. Will never go back  . Horrible place. please help to rip those guys a new one.",0
5,"An amazing and innovative new establishment, we stopped in on a weekend trip from Vegas. Good was excellent (bone marrow was stellar) and the brews were top notch. The corn whiskey was excellent and the service was friendly with a touch of class. We enjoyed it so much that we returned the next night to enjoy more of its diverse menu and beer selection...Most definitely worth a ""shot"" and Reno is lucky to have this great option for food, beer and whiskey connoisseurs...",2
5,I absolutely enjoyed my Ultimate pedicure! Service staff are nice and professional. There are a wide range of nail polish brands such as Chanel and Zoya! The best thing is this place doesn't have that annoying nail polish smell. I will definitely come back.,2
5,I get something different every time and it's always great! The prices don't bother me ( or paying for rice-which is loaded w vegetables and spices ) because I don't go here for cheap food. Always fresh and fast! The servers are nice and quick. I love the atmosphere as well.,2
5,"I've always ordered through UberEATS, so I can't speak on place itself but the food has always been on point. I've never been to a place that has a sub style sandwich and a burrito that we're both really good. Should you go out of your way to go to 51st Deli? Probably not, but it's super solid with both fairly authentic Mexican food and American sandwiches.",2
5,Great place for a great burger. In St. Louis for business and wanted to find a good burger. Had the Wildfire  burger which was super delicious. Along with chili cheese fries topped with jalapeños. The soda pop selection is crazy so many to choose from. When in town this is definitely a place to visit.,2
5,"I can't believe what I paid for a room that had a spa, two televisions, king size bed, a dining area and a living room area for such a low price. I booked online to get the best rate, but it was super cheap. I look forward to coming back again real soon!",2
4,"Went here today with my little one for a pop in and play day.Things to know: This place can be super packed, so if you plan on going I would buy an advance ticket to the pop in day on their website.Also go to Miracle Mile and then take the frontage road down towards Prince because it is between Miracle Mile and Prince.Positive:  it is a great place to take the kids on a hot day, my daughter loves it, parents can play with the kids, it is different and seems cleaner than a mall play place or fast food play placeNegative: it can get super busy and parents seems to have no problem not watching their kids especially older kids which means the littler kids will get trampled (my daughter was pushed down at least 3 times within an hour today)",2
5,"Leslie was and the front desk girl were so warm and genuine. This was my first time at Pia, but I strangely felt as if I'd been going there for years. I appreciated the water and tea provided in the waiting area, and my experience with my brow waxing and tinting was nearly painless and so much fun! Leslie talked to me pretty much the whole time, checking to make sure that I liked the shape and color and making this first time experience very enjoyable. I will definitely be recommending Pia to friends and will be returning myself!",2
5,"I drive down the 101 from the Bay Area to LA frequently. Whenever I can, I stop here for a meal.  Their charashi bowl is fantastic and for the lunch special, it's a great price!  Love the people here and this something I always look forward to on my drive!",2
1,"Would give zero stars if possible. Let me start with the caveat that the band is fantastic, I would give them five stars. They are great performers and play very well (though I will grant that I do not know much about jazz). My complaint is lodged firmly with the people that run Preservation Hall. I didn't care about waiting in line, or the (looking back rather steep) cover charge. It was a little annoying that the room was set up more for a poetry slam than a jazz hall but whatever. No, my real complaint lies in how they have a ridiculous (imo) cell phone rule that they insisted on enforcing like the gluten-free ban at a Montessori school bake sale. When we got there there were multiple signs that warned against taking photos or video. This was really disappointing as I had really hoped to at least take a photo. But okay, as disappointing as it was, I hung in there (mostly because one of the people in my party really loves jazz and we had already paid the cover charge). The show gets ready to start and this lady comes out and gives this oddly pretentious speech (this is downtown NOLA, not Whole Foods) and reminds us like six times not to dare take a photo. This is only an annoyance at this point, like we get it, there are literally at least four signs in this room of forty people. Finally the lights go out in the room, musicians come out and I'm ready to chill. Now, one thing you should know is that Preservation Hall is that it is essentially a box of a room with large open doorways that lead out into a narrow hall that leads outside. The second thing you should know is that they leave the lights on in the hallway the whole time (they sell things out there). This means that anyone who moves around in the hallway is distracting, simply based off the light that attracts your eyes. Anyways, the music starts and for a few seconds it looks like this place just might redeem itself, like I said the jazz is great. Then, about two minutes in, the lady who lectured us before comes scuttling into the doorway where she starts peering into the gloom at the patrons. After a few seconds, she scurries back down the hall out of sight (again, this is really distracting because of the lights). At first I figured she was looking for someone or something but as she proceeds to repeat this performance every couple minutes I begin to realize she's policing the silent audience for the flash of a cell phone. Not only is this insane, (I didn't see a single person so much as twitch toward their phones) but if you have to police something with this level of intensity then maybe start a jazz club in a maximum security prison. After about twenty-thirty minutes the whole experience was so unpleasant that we all just left. 0/10 would never recommend.",0
4,I had their strawberry crepes and the grindhouse freddo by far 10x's better than any starbucks coffee I will for sure be enjoying this again.,2
3,"I regularly go to student salons for hair cuts and styling. I have long, fine, mostly straight Asian hair, and have had mixed results from the Aveda Institute -- to be expected considering I had a different stylist in every case.Just know that if you haven't had a student stylist before, don't expect perfection. Do expect the cut to take an inordinately long time compared to a seasoned professional -- most of my cuts/styles have taken around 2 hours. The basic cut price includes massaging wash, cut, and blowdry style, plus the stylists do take the time to check in with their teachers and make sure the cut is going the way you want it to. Another plus: all of the stylists I've had at the Aveda Institute have been professional and committed to their service, which isn't always the case at other schools. And the prices are right.",1
5,"My sister discovered this restaurant and our family is so happy to have some authentic Salvadoran food. Food is great but the service is sometimes slow, so don't be in a rush when you go. Pupusas and the Bistec Salvadoreano -- yum!",2
2,"The concierge at our hotel recommended this restaurant after we asked for a creole restaurant nearby.  My friend and I both had the jambalaya and fried catfish and were both sorely disappointed.  The catfish had no flavor and the jambalaya was dry and lukewarm.  The atmosphere was no better.  Our server was nice enough.  I give it two stars, one for the service and one for the free cornbread with honey butter sauce.",0
5,"Really nice IHOP. Clearly it's very new. The service was very good. The wait was short. Lilliana, Liz and Kim were extremely attentive (they use teams of servers) for Sunday breakfast.  Since its an IHOP, it's not like there's anything all that different in the menu, but the food was really good. Nice and hot, not greasy. My wife had an omelette and I had the sampler. We would definitely eat here again. Apparently a lot of people come here for Birthday breakfasts as there were three times when staff came out clapping singing Happy Birthday. Ignore the reviewers that talk about bad smells and other nonsense. They only have one post so they have some kind of axe to grind. This place is fine.",2
4,"FABULOUS!!! Picture it New Year's morning 2 a.m. walking down Bourbon Street in thigh high boots & needing FOOD! My boyfriend was appalled that after all my times in NOLA, I had never had a chili dog from the Lucky Dog cart on the street!  I have to say it hit the spot! The toppings were great, the hot dog yummy, but it was the BUN!!! The bun was almost buttery nearly melting in my mouth and has the perfect temperature all WARM!!! Will definitely add to my must eats in NOLA!",2

4,"This is a great quiet place to eat very 1960's business style.  You can have the food of Tony's or eat off the bar menu.  I had the Risotto which was excellent.  Other people at the table had the special, linguine with shrimp and lobster, and strip steak.  Everyone loved their meals.  Of course the service here is fantastic.  They are not overbearing but attentive as well.",2
5,awesome place.  good food. nice people.  rotating specials.  all home made.  what else do you want?  Chicken salad is a great pickup to make sandwiches at home.,2

The debris fries are a must, you wont be disappointed unless you dont try them.  I had the fireman burger and love that they donate $1 for every fireman burger to the local fire department.  The burger was very good and Shea was an amazing bartender.  Youll regret it if you dont stop in here.  Im coming back a second time no question about it.",2
4,"Fresh, flavorful, healthy and a great selection of items to customize my meal the way I want - that is why I come to Qdoba.  Fast food at its best - better than most area Mexican restaurants and on par with  those upscale tacorias that keep popping up. The line was out the door today but everyone waited patiently for their turn to create a lunchtime masterpiece. I waited about 10 minutes before it was my turn. Today, I ordered a taco salad to go.  My server was deep in concentration as he ensured perfection of the salad. The lime tequila chicken was moist, refreshing and flavorful. Fresh cilantro and pico were fantastic. Lots of romaine and a few shredded chips on top. And don't forget the guacamole and a little queso .....want a salad. All for $7.90. I can see the ingredients are FRESH. What a great deal. They have also added shrimp and roast brisket to the menu options. And some fancy hipster tacos. I completed the survey on my checkout receipt for free chips next visit. They care what I think!The only thing that would make Qdoba better would be margaritas or some good craft beer for the dinner menu.",2
5,"I loved working with Theresa! When I agreed with her on a price for my wedding dress alterations, I wondered if it would feel worth it in the end. It was! She made my slightly lower-end David's Bridal dress feel luxurious and perfect and look incredibly elegant with a beautiful bustle that stayed perfectly in place all night.",2
2,"I chose 2 stars because of the ""meh, I've experienced better"" idea yelp suggests. The salon is clean and pleasant, but parking can be a little limited during rush. They were able to take me in as a walk-in a couple of times, with not too much waiting time. My first time was a good experience, but the next two weren't so great. I got this nail technician ""Cam"" to do my fill and full set the next two times, just by random availability. I felt like she took too long to do the nails, trying to act like she was very particular about them being in perfect condition, but the nails weren't perfect. She was also pushy for me to request her for my next appointments, which I didn't care for. The last time I went is where I draw the line on coming back. She charged me for one of my nails that was broken that she fixed, where as every other salon I've been to has taken care of it complimentary. Then when she was painting my nails, she came back at the end and painted the white ends to match the rest of my nail color, but it left uneven lines across all of my nails. Picture someone painting something, and then coming back over the already painted area, only half the nail and in a different direction. I was pretty upset that I went back inside to have her fix them, but she made me feel like I was upset over nothing. Recommend finding another place.",0
4,"Great service, oysters, crab cake sandwich, crab she chowder and drinks! You should come here!!",2
2,"U can skip this place. Terrible service and below average food. One review rates its as comparable to Zahav and other great places in Philly and thats the only reason we wanted to try this place. First we were 15min late and received a call to confirm our rez because as the hostess said ""we are holding your table"". When we arrived the place was almost empty. The waiter described the menu in detail (lots of details) and forgot to mention that they were out certain items and decided that it was ok to substitute those items in the dishes with pickled vegetables; also forgot to mention that for Aldine ""puffed quinoa"" means burned inedible charred quinoa. The food took forever to arrive and the waiter came too fast to take the plates/food away... Why hurry us when the place is almost empty?. I gave this place two starts because the cocktails were really good, but thats about it. I wont be coming back.",0
5,"I was in town for business with myself and a couple of co workers we were looking for a good place to relax and have some ice cold beers. Came across The Craft House on Yelp and we were very pleased with the awesome craft beer selection they have! I tried the Hop King Imperial IPA and it was fantastic! The bartender recommended the new shrimp po boy sandwich and it was delicious reminded me of a po boy I had in New Orleans. We played some pool and had a great time. I will be returning to The Craft House on my next business trip this coming summer. Thanks for the great food, beer and service!",2
3,"i love the decor, i love the vibe of this place!! but noodles..? eeeehhh here's what they seriously messed up on-- serving a bowl of noodles (to me) that's not piping steamy HOT!! and people might think ""that is so trivial.."" NO! b/c of this.. my bean sprouts did not cook.. keep in mind, my egg was also only half cooked.. the high temperature of the soup was supposed to complete the cooking when served.  #2, i gradually slowed down my slurping toward the 2nd half because it was getting cold and frankly, it just wasn't too appetizing anymore..  there were other things that bothered me too like how little soup they gave you lol.. but i'll stop here so i don't sound like a complete jerk.so being #12 out of 50 on foobooz, i was holding a certain level of expectations..  i see lots of potential here and i did have a fun dining experience with my friend.. but i rather take my money else where.. on the plus side, i did enjoy the dumplings (braised ribs with eggplant)-- it's always a plus when i can taste what they say it is inside lol",1

The blackened brie was our appetizer choice and it was delicious! It came with some buttered toasted bread along with sliced apples and mango chutney. We thoroughly enjoyed it.  I had the Balboa sandwich which is a prime rib french dip.  It was equally delicious.  My husband tried the Sea Bass with sugar snap peas...he substituted a side with curry in it for the goat cheese grit cakes.  All I can say for those grit cakes is SPECTACULAR!  All in all, this meal was a fine experience.  We love to eat out and since the kiddies are grown and gone, we do it frequently.  We are always on the look-out for new places to try and when we find a good one, we find ourselves going back time and again.  This place will be at the top of our list for awhile.  There were lots of interesting items on the menu that we would like to try and if the rest of them are as good as the ones we sampled last weekend, we will be thrilled!  I'd also like to add that our server (whose name escapes me) was wonderful.  He was attentive without being overbearing and he offered several tips on the food, also telling us about their brunch on the weekends.  We got great service in addition to great food.  No complaints here!!!!",2
5,"I have only been to the brewery to pick up beer for releases. Today was my first time sitting down and grabbing a beer. The brewery makes some outstanding beers and are always looking to make an imprint on the craft beer scene in St. Louis. During the warmer, they have a great patio to sit drink and play games. It's one of the great breweries in St. Louis so if you are around, check it out.",2
5,"excellent service, would recommend for sure !!! They have a variety of incredible wheels, my mustang was wonderful, thank you so much for the service!",2
2,not that good as told。room service is very slow，I call at 10:00am  setting up for lunch，keeping waiting until noon，figure out that they set up my lunch has been deliver at 12:30pm，what is that happened！,0
1,"Service sucks here around noon been waiting over an hour for a simple breakfast for 2. The food smells great if I could only damn well eat it. Like for real I've seen like 4 groups walk in order, eat and leave and we haven't got anything yet.",0
3,Their sushi is pretty good. Mesa rolls are my fav here. They would be 4stars if they gave better estimations for pick ups. It is typical that they lag a lot and they seem to make it after you show up.,1
1,"After waiting 40 min to get in....-Hot breakfast served cold.-Food not prepared as requested (requested sausage links burnt, even after sending them back still not as requested. Eggs requested as over-medium, whites were runny).-had to ask for refills on coffee.-waitress seemed apathetic to deficiencies.-once finished, we waited more than 10 minutes to get check, long enough to write , review and post this review.-$40 (simple) breakfast for two.",0
5,"I first heard about this place on the plane ride over from a Franklin local.  He recommended that we brave the line and try one of Nashvilles best breakfast spots.  HE WAS RIGHT.  Holly cow this place kicked butt and we didn't even have to wait in line!! We were lucky to miss the rush said our waitress.   I had this super savory corn pancake with bacon, salsa, and sour cream. So good. This place will always be a stop when I get back to the south~~~",2
5,"This is hands down the best place to get gourmet coffee that isn't overpriced! It's cheaper if you drink your coffee there [versus getting it to go] and trust me, you'll want to stay unless you're in a hurry. The cafe itself is pretty big and has 2 areas that are separated by the counter/kitchen. They also have a bar (hence the name) and a food menu. Their desserts are generously proportioned and there's a wide selection to choose from. My friend and I tried the oversized snickerdoodle cookie, which was pretty decent for a standard cookie- soft and chewy and not overly sweet. The staff was very friendly and flexible. Definitely a place I'll have to come back to.",2
1,There was no waiting line but still no one wanted to sit us even though many asked how many for dinner. Once sited no one came to our table. The restrooms were dirty and no toilet paper. Looked like it had not been cleaned in days. I would not recommend to anyone this location.,0
3,I came here with my sister and niece so they can buy souvenirs before heading back home.  The lady working was nice to my niece.  There was nothing that really stood out in this store.  They ended up getting some shirts and keychains.,1
5,"Spoke with Jeff over the phone, and he was super helpful, kind and very patient during my myriad of questions. Really helpful, fabulous employee, excellent representative.  Came by to join, and met the assistant manager John, a very professional, high energy human, toured me around the gym, showed me all the opportunities I have to work out. Including the extra spa features in the upgraded Black membership. I am very excited about the infrared therapy for its collagen producing benefits, and the massage tables. Morgan is the in gym personal trainer that offers FREE Instructional classes as well as personal goal and best practices for achieving your goal. I signed up for Black membership on the spot. Fabulous prices, twenty-four hour NO EXCUSES open time. I am looking forward to the judgment free Zone and all the great workout. Thank you to the dream team who invented a amazing priced gym. And it's decorated in my favorite color ..purple.",2
1,"I purchased a groupon for ""high tea for two"" but really it should have been ""low tea"". I wanted to take my mother as part of her BD celebration. It took me three phone calls and two messages which were never returned to even get a reservation. I did inform them that I had a groupon in all messages and conversations. We arrived a few minutes prior to our reservation time and I gave them the groupon as instructed per groupon policy. We were promptly seated but no on came to greet us, take our orders for tea or even just a nod and ""I'll be with you soon"" for over ten minutes. Eventually someone did take our orders and bring out our rasberry sage tea which was ""okay"" but nothing spectacular. My mother's salad and my soup arrived....only my soup had been sloshed all over the small bowl and was running down the side into the paper doily and all over the serving plate. At a tea house, you expect the best service, atmosphere, presentation, etc. and this place and/or staff didn't deliver. Furthermore, my she-crab soup was very watery and really lacked any flavor. The rest of our ""tea"" was ""okay"" but again, nothing special or fabulous in taste or presentation. I do a better job when I entertain in my home with taste and attention to detail. I was trying not to make negative comments as it was my mother's birthday but the real insult came when the bill was presented and I noticed they added an automatic %18 gratuity.......for two people????? I would have tipped well anyway, even though it was not earned, as my son works in the service industry and I typically tip 20%. I wanted to say something but again, I was trying to keep the mood happy for my mom and it wasn't about the money but rather their attitude and greediness. Not sure if they had an issue with groupons or are they just this mediocre and entitled in general with their customers??? Overall, not a great experience and don't think I will ever return.",0
5,"Favorite Thai in the neighborhood! Great for takeout with excellent and diverse offerings. Love ending the meal with the peanut pancake, so glad to have found this spot and the curries are rich and thick (green is my favorite) filled with more types of veggies than one usually finds. Heads and shoulders above any of the Asian spots on the South St corridor.",2
5,"My husband, Kevin and I, had a lovely lunch today, July 18th. Dawson's food was Very Good. We ordered 2 orders of deep fried fish and a cheeseburger. Our server was Shannon and she was great--pleasant and skilled; we had a leisurely lunch and we never felt rushed. We ordered 3 meals because the lunch portions were smaller, and when we ordered a hamburger, as our 3rd meal, Shannon was nice enough to ask someone in their kitchen to half it and put it on another plate for us. We didn't ask for this courtesy but it was appreciated. It showed us her attention to detail. And our runner for drinks and plate removal was Karolina. She was very accommodating, and very pleasant, too. Dawson's definitely has some of the nicest employees you will find.",2
3,"Yes yes yes, I will review this place once i've actually eaten here! But, I just wanted to say that it's not the greatest place to grab a slice for takeout. Although there are tables and chairs outside on the sidewalk (nice touch), it's more of a sit-down place. There is a bar to chill out and have a beer while you wait, but since it was packed we didn't want to stand awkwardly next to a table and wait for a slice to come out. Interior is nice. I appreciate how clean and well-kept it looks.I think the fact that this place is busy means it must be doing something right. However, the wait staff we talked to was very awkward, not helpful, and made me want to run out of there. So, I did.",1
5,"Decided to try this out for a late morning Sunday brunch option.  Tried the classic breakfast, a nest egg and a hand squeezed OJ.  Firstly - super excited about housemade biscuits.  Its really shocking to me that very few places bother to do this.  Gravy was tasty, but could have used a little more.  Now, in all fairness, I treat gravy like an entree as opposed to an accompaniment, so for ""normal"" folk, you may find the gravy quantity acceptable.  I went with bacon, which was really good - thick slices, nice and crispy.  And my eggs were cooked perfectly to order.  I really liked the crispy potatoes, as well.  Two, small whole potatoes, well seasoned and seared on the outside.  The OJ was fresh and tasty - not too tart. My friend had the nest egg.  She thought it was really tasty, but since I didn't try it, I don't have much to say about that. I think the food is excellent.  I will agree with other reviews - not a fan of the community seating.  We didn't have an issue finding a seat and people did move along quickly, but since folks tend to want to catch up over a meal, you don't really have the privacy or the space to do that here.  I am hoping the excellent food results in more seating!!",2
5,"I enjoyed a wonderful dinner here with a friend from London and my mom and had a wonderful time. We called early in the day for a reservation at 5:30 but when we arrived they couldn't locate it. No problem. The place was not crowded when we arrived and we were promptly seated. When we left the place was full. I would suggest making reservations as I imagine on the weekend it is packed.Our waiter was very professional and helpful with recommendations. Our first wine selection couldn't be located but the recommended substitute was excellent.The fresh, warm bread we started out with was very good. We shared the toasted raviolis and the mushrooms with polenta. Both were excellent. I would say these are some of the best toasted raviolis around.  It's very easy to tell they were never frozen. I ordered the ""Hay and Straw"" and loved it. I even had leftovers which is a rare event. The other two dining partners loved their meals as well.I will come back here again when looking for a great Italian meal in a classy setting.",2
4,"Normally I don't like hipster places, or hipsters for that matter. I had to make an exception to policy and try this place due to the great reviews. Though the Topos menu was very very limited, the flatbread and sweet potato chips were excellent. The drink choices where ample was very interesting beverage options. I opted for the beer on tap, which was a pumpkin and it is the only pumpkin beer I've ever enjoyed. The options on tap are great. The ambience is pretty decent too. If you were just meeting up and want to snack and a drink, this is your place.",2
5,"Milktooth is the place to go if you want a good breakfast cocktail and a twist on traditional brunch. At first glance of the menu, you may think you've never heard of any of these foods for breakfast, and you may be right. I guarantee no matter what you order, you're going to enjoy it. Milktooth is one of the most popular brunch places in Indy, which means you will typically have a wait. Trust me, it's worth the usual 30 minute wait (on weekends). To make it go by a little faster, they've got a walk up bar for their coffee drinks and pastries. Snack on one of those to give you a preview of the amazing meal you're about to have.Their menu changes from time to time but they have a few things that stay one the menu but change ingredients. I love all of their variations on a Dutch pancake, and their raclette grilled cheese is to die for.  If you're making this a boozy breakfast, don't pass up on the michelada. And sit outside if it's warm enough!",2
5,"RANDOMLY stumbled in here one night and was blown away...food is so insanely good and the vibe was so neat. Really, truly a rarity...",2
5,"Fantastic place to get donuts, and their prices are amazing. This is definitely my go to place when I'm craving donuts.",2
1,"Was contacted by this company from an inquiry I did for a moving quote for North American Moving Company.  The representative came to my house on Monday and it took 4 days for actually to receive the moving quote estimate.  When received the quote saw many charges on it for services that I didn t asked for and things in it that never seen before on an estimate.  When called the representative about this had no clue about any of the charges.  To me seems that they are a rip off company and trying to make the most money possible the easiest way !  I advice anyone to stay away from this company and do your research well before deciding to hire any moving company.  Oh, I also forgot that the moving quote I received was outrageous and ridiculous !",0
3,"If you're in it for the scene, it doesn't get better than The French Press in SB. If you're in it for the coffee, go somewhere else.I really wanted to like this place because the vibe is awesome and I love supporting local businesses, but their drip coffee is over-roasted and WAY too bitter. Hot, iced, it doesn't matter. It's all super bitter. I wanted to like it so bad that I had one of their baristas personally french press me a 16-oz cup of coffee hand-chosen based on my desired flavor profile. It took 10-15 minutes to make and cost me $6. It was terrible. So. Effing. Bitter.To be clear, I'm specifically talking about their coffee in this review. Their lattes and cappuccinos look delicious, but I've never tried them. That's not really my jam. So if you're like me and just want a regular coffee, go somewhere else (Handlebar, SB Roasting Co.).",1
4,It's cheap and they have a good selection.I am not sure that you can expect much.  Lately the ppl who work there seem to be nicer.  Hopefully that lasts.,2
5,Ice repair center did excellent and quick job replacing my iPad's cracked screen. Personnel was very pleasant and informative-explained what had to be done and did it expeditiously. Everyone was very professional. Was a good experience and reasonably priced. Will be back and recommend Ice to my friends. Excellent experience. Thanks LJ.,2
3,"I really think Herbie's is more in the 3.5 stars range, and it could be bumped up to 4 after we try out their brunch (heard it's amazing!) or some of their cocktails that other reviewers raved about.Not sure if this place is ever crowded, but it certainly was fairly empty on a Wednesday night, so we were seated immediately.  I love sitting in the patio area with the view of Euclid.Food:1) Corn Chowder (special) - heard it was pretty good.2) Ligurian Shrimp Pasta - nice and fresh.  It def had a spicy kick to it, but not so much that someone like me who can't handle spiciness was able to enjoy a few bites.  Shrimp was cooked perfectly and were pretty large.3) Lobster Mac & Cheese (special) - pretty good.  Not swamped in cheese, though it lacked a little flavor (nothing some salt didn't fix).  Pretty big pieces of lobster.",1
5,"Comfortable beds!The hotel is overall very good, but most impressive were the beds... they're comfortable! Most hotels cheap out & buy hard (uncomfortable) beds because they last longer, but Drury's were great and we slept really well.The location is good for the value, and the hotel is very accessible.Bathrooms were very clean, and had LOTS of water... more water out of a shower head than I can remember at any hotel ever (usually it's just a trickle).Free breakfast and snacky dinner were good, though only an idiot would stay in NOLA and fill up on free hotel hot dogs.The only negative is the loud hall & door latches. All night long you hear other rooms' doors going KA-CHUNK.Free WiFi is nice... amazing that some hotels still charge for this.After the Royal Sonesta, this is my new favorite NOLA hotel (and it costs 1/2 as much).",2
5,"Wonderful company to do business with. We had two homes outside of Tucson that were left in questionable condition after a bad contractor had his way with them and needed a reputable licensed electrician to go over everything with a fine toothed comb. Bonnie understood our situation as we already had a buyer for the home, ready to move in and needed to address any potential issues ASAP. She sent us Anthony, a wonderful guy who really knows his stuff. He did a thorough job of reviewing the entire service, including the breaker boxes, lines throughout each structure as well as the outlets and switches. One week later he was out addressing each item that was a cause of concern so that we could hand over the keys to our buyer with confidence, knowing that the homes were safe and fully operational. I highly recommend Buddy Heilig & Sons to anyone in the local Tucson area needing electric service!",2
4,"I've been staying at this hotel for about four weeks (on work assignment in Trenton) and it's definitely one of the most modern hotels I've stayed in. The rooms are nicely appointed and the bed is amazingly comfortable. It's a really popular spot for business travelers and it's definitely seen a lot of hard use. That's why I can't give it five stars, because their facilities people don't seem to keep the rooms in fantastic condition nor do the housekeepers do a lot of the 'little things' (like dusting/cleaning the top of the enormous shower heads or making sure all the drawers are flushed and leveled) that set other places apart.The breakfasts are okay, for what they are... it's not the Ritz Carlton or W.A., so anyone who gripes about the food needs to lower their expectations a little. The coffee is kind of horrible but that's okay b/c there's a Starbucks in the lobby of the Courtyard across the street or one exit up in Ewing. I knew what I was getting (having stayed in other extended-stay type hotels) when I booked my stays and I was not surprised.All in all, it's the favorite hotel of my team and we'll continue staying here when we're on assignment in Trenton.Tips:-East Sushi and Palermo's Pizza are two really good delivery places nearby and the front desk folks will give you menus.-Metro Grill is a fairly good sit-down place nearby.-Masa 8 is a very good sushi joint about two exits up.-Mikonos (Greek) is iffy, probably should avoid it.-Buy your beer and wine at the liquor store one exit up (it's in the same shopping center with the Starbucks, plus there's a supermarket there too)... $6/bottle for a Sam Adams is a little steep.-There's also a really good Italian place in that shopping center - Piccolo Trattoria.-They have a huge gas grill on the patio at this hotel... another team from my company has done a lot of grilling here, so if you're going to be at the element for a while with a team, it's a great way to hang out and have dinner together.-If the lobby music is making you crazy, ask them to turn it down or off... especially later on in the evening if you happen to be in the lobby.",2
3,"Since my previous review they have more consistency in the quality of the food.  Staff is always great and there is now wifi, which was a major deficiency.  This place is friendly, comfortable and good.",1
5,"Was not expected much, until we arrived the it was packed outside. Not only was it packed but they were extremely efficient. The custard was great I did not think it was overly sweet and some what light. I had the tiramisu with pistachio and that was good. Kind of their version of it but none the less great! Would definitely go back when I am in town!",2
5,"What's not to love about Bing's Boba?  This place has everything:1) Freshly made boba with the right mouth-feel2) Fast and friendly service3) The prices are right4) Clean facilities and establishment5) Card games, board games, couches, and plenty of seating6) Loyalty card - buy 10 drinks and get the 11th free!They really do a fantastic job with iced teas w/ boba.  I'm talking about ANY iced tea: Thai, matcha, Hong Kong, hibiscus... you name it. I have tried them all without any sweeteners, and they are simply fantastic.  That's when you know it's good ;)",2
4,"Great bbq. I love their mac and cheese,  as well as their other sides. The brisket is extremely tender,  and so is the pork. You also get free ice cream so that never hurts, lol.",2
5,Tessie was a fanatic guide--a font of New Orleans knowledge. I really enjoyed the whole experience and took her advice on other city spots.,2
2,"welcome to mediocre (at best) cuisine.  they're a chain.  expect nothing more.  when I ordered a ""healthy choices"" chicken dish, it came SMOTHERED in pepper.  when I complained, the chef was very accommodating, but I was a little confused by her reply ""yeah, when I cook at home, I never use pepper on my food.  there's just a lot of pepper in the sauce.""  YES.  I KNOW.  and why would you serve food that you, as a chef, would never eat?  two stars only because they didn't charge me for the chicken entree.  otherwise, two thumbs DOWN.oh yeah- host service= idiot 16 year olds that don't know the first thing about customer servicewait service= incompetent",0
3,"What's up with your night? Well, why not grab a classic Tony Luke's Jersey-style cheesesteak and hit up the bar connected to the bowling alley. Bowling alley? Cheesesteak chain with a dive bar? Okay, I am cringing on the thought of how embarrassing that sounds for NJ, but regardless that's how the good old Garden State represents. I met up with my group of guys and gals, surrounded ourselves with our glorious looking cheesesteaks, filled up on drinks and sat around b/sing the night away at the bar. Aw, yeah! A laid back night with food and my buds.At Tony's you can order cheesesteak (substitution chicken steak available), burgers, fries and your standard fried grab and go grub. My cheesesteak was served on a fresh roll, with American cheese that complimented the steak with fried mushrooms. With a handful of fries, it was all washed down with a cold one from the inside bar. Now, it wasn't by far the best cheesesteak I've had but right square dead in the middle of good and average.Despite the sticky floor and fact that my shoes felt suctioned to the ground, service was decent. The cashier takes the order, lists your name and when they're ready it's announced on the loud speaker. The loud speaker shout out is clutch because there is no need to stand around awkwardly waiting. You are free to roam around and come or go. In the end, dinner is served and without ever paying a bridge toll to Philly's real Tony's.",1
3,"I could say that this is a touch of Italy in a strip mall, but even I recognize that is a little too precious. Stepping into the dark, cool interior of Sapore made for a refreshing change after the sweltering July heatwave. It was no problem for our party of three to be seated; the fact that we had a reservation helped, I am sure. We started out with drinks--bellinis for my two dinner companions and a classic vodka martini for me. I appreciated being able to customize my drink with a blue-cheese-stuffed olive and an anchovy. I would never have thought to put an anchovy in a martini, but it looks like this will be a new obsession for me. On to the food. We opted to skip the appetizers and go straight to soup/salad and entrees (all the better to save room for dessert). My mom went with the Italian soup and my other dining companion and I split the Caprese salad, a solid presentation that did not blow me away, but certainly does not provide grist for anything like the negative reviews of this establishment that I have seen on yelp. I didn't know what to expect in terms of pasta portions here, so I went with the Chicken Marsala. It might have been nice to have pasta to pick up some of the sauce, but I appreciated that the dish was hot by temperature and I even had enough for leftovers (to which I added pasta, in the comfort and convenience of my home).The dessert selection was excellent. We went with the tiramisu. I understand Sapore also has an excellent cannoli which I would like to try on a future visit. I would be tempted to come back, if only for another excellent martini, appetizers, and another run through the dessert menu.",1
5,"I will get straight to the point..... If you are ever anywhere near Camden NJ, In fact if you are anywhere in the State of NJ, get to Santana's for breakfast and pastries.   Their coffee puts Starbucks, DD, Micky D's and all the rest to shame!!   Their pastries are INCREDIBLE!!  You would have to fly to Boricua ( Puerto Rico) to even come close!!    My business is in neighboring Pennsauken, and we are there every morning!!!",2
4,The korean wings are really good I like that they use real fresh chicken even for the boneless wings. The mega fries were solid and I like the variety of sauces although I do wish they had a better garlic parm.,2
5,"Always fresh and fast, once you taste these it ruins the other places for you. Going back to a Starbucks, Dunkin, or grocery store bagel is just not an option. All the cream cheese flavors are mixed fresh in the store. The veggie cream cheese is awesome!The owner is also charitable and frequently provides local nonprofits with end of the day bagels. It bears mentioning that he does so because everything is made fresh each morning so there are no carryovers.",2
5,Referred to Josh by a friend and could not be happier with his service and care for my two puppies. My dog has sever anxiety when left alone but thanks to Josh I don't have to worry about that now she is always cared for and loves to play with all her new friends. He has great day care and overnight services and is awesome about working around my work schedule!,2
5,"Thank you Yelp for another good find. A great choice when in town. Just behind Busch Gardens, being from out of town I may have been skeptical being off the beaten path and not the best neighborhood. Don't let that hold you back. Went with my kids and glad we did. The service is very friendly and professional. Must be the owners, they take pride in their business and it shows. Food was delicious, perfectly prepared and presented.",2
1,"UPDATE to my used car purchase ..... it's been a little over a month, and the detailers wax and scratch remover has started to wear off, and wouldn't you know, scratches EVERYWHERE on the hood and trunk. Deliberately hidden by a professional detail job..... you seriously need to hate yourself if you are going to buy a car here. I guess this is why they were so hell bent on selling a dings, dents, and scratches warranty.",0
4,The first my hair was braided and I did not feel pain. I have a big head. My hair was completed in about 4 hours which was great time. Now the downfall is that my braider did not braid my hair pass the length of my natural hair which began to poof out weeks later because I do not have a relaxer. I used human hair because my scalp can no longer tolerate the synthetic hair that is normally used. I was a little upset afterwards because I had to take the braids out in 3 weeks time which was almost like a waste of money.,2
5,Best Cuban sandwich that I ever had. I love this place. Good prices and great quality food.,2
2,"Well, this hits the spot on things that I don't really care for in a bar.  What kept it from having only 1 star?  They had a couple of decent craft-ish beers on tap.  Otherwise, yuck.I came in to watch the end of a UK Basketball game (in which they lost...boo).  I got an immediate coaster and 1st beer.  She brought me a menu, then didn't make eye contact again for 15 minutes!  For a while, the bar was fairly full and I'm not sure why they didn't run 2 bartenders.  There was another waitress going around the room trying to sell shots in plastic cups.  That tells you something, right?  At that point, the game was close to over and I didn't worry about the wings.  Maybe she knew that I didn't need the calories.  For a while, the bar was fairly full and I'm not sure why they didn't run 2 bartenders.  There was another waitress going around the room trying to sell shots in plastic cups.  That tells you something, right?Anyway, not a fan of the service.The place smelled so smoky, ugh.  I forgot that you can still smoke in bars in some places.  The place that I was sitting had a broken place on the bar, like the brass rail for your feet was totally falling apart so that I could bounce my feet.  Maybe that was the plan.",0
5,"Another five-star dining review!  Fresco serves-up wonderful fresh and tasty pizza.  We tried this store as a change in our usual fare when we visit Tucson during the gem shows.  For what you get, their prices are very reasonable.  My husband and I were new, and the friendly young man behind the counter told us about their pizza, how it is made from all fresh ingredients, etc.  The restaurant was very clean and inviting.  We ordered the meat-special pizza, which included chunks of chicken besides the usual sausage, pepperoni, ham and bacon.  The pizza was GREAT!  Crispy AND tender crust, plenty of toppings, and a ""multiple-napkiner.""  We also had a nice talk with the young owner, and you can tell his business is his passion and only wants to serve the best and highest quality food to his customers.  We will definitely return next year!  Do I recommend Fresco?...YOU BETCHA I DO!!!",2
5,Excellent restaurant & service. Very nice atmosphere & friendly staff. I have tried the pizza & the calzone. Really nice and I loved it.,2
1,"I really wanted to like Sunday's. I mean I REALLLLLLY wanted to like Sunday's.  I had the opportunity to check in on a Saturday night and then I was also scheduled for a birthday brunch the next day. I have two seperate events I will describe. First, the Saturday night adventure. We had reservations for the evening and when we arrived, there were a few tables in there but the place was not busy yet. We get service from a waiter who was already scattered and overwhelmed. Not sure why, as it was not very busy.  He takes our drink orders and we wait for them. And we wait for them. And we wait for them. And we wait for them.   We can see them sitting there getting watered down for like 15 minutes.   I was tempted to grab them off the bar but I wanted to see what the issue was.  Well, I would have asked HIM but he never returned.  So a female server comes to the next table.   They are complaining they ordered their cocktails about 15 mins ago and asked her if she could check on them. I sorta piped in from my table and stated we were also waiting for ours. She came back and delivered everyones drinks.  Still - our waiter is a miss. Yet I have seen take care of like 3 tables that have since come in after us and who are getting appetizers already. Us... well we haven't ordered. So then about 40+ minutes, he comes to us as we are done with the small bread basket and says our meals will be right up and takes our menus.   WHOA - We are WAITING for YOU to take our order. So table next to us is complaining and I was fed up but not rude. Owners lady/server comes over and is very nice and takes care of things. She states that since they just won Best of The Bay in CL - they were not prepared to be so busy. I totally understand that but then you should have stopped with the 40 other people coming in if you couldn't handle the 25 already in there. Food - by the time we received it was ok. Not bad, but after waiting an hour, we were scarfing it down to catch our concert. I had a salad. Fresh but barely any dressing. I had the mussels and frittes app as a dinner with the salad. Would have been decent but was fed up at that point. -----  So then we left.  I was apprehensive about returning the next day but owners lady/server who was very nice made sure to let me know they would be FULLY staffed the following day and she guaranteed a better experience. So Sunday come's....   We have a large table (about 12-14 people). I have a feeling that Dugg (review below) came in when we were there. There were actually two large parties that day. The wait was crazy for people who came in even tho there were plenty of tables. They couldn't handle the amount of guests. Food for breakfast was subpar. Overcooked eggs, greasy bacon, super hard foccaccia as the base for the benedict.   Another bad day. So I chalk a lot up to the place being very overwhelmed while they are experiencing growing pains.  They are not able to handle the customers that are coming in with one cook.   I would call this place Sunday's Dining and NOT Sunday's Fine Dining until they can work out the kinks.   There were a LOT of unhappy people on both experiences. From other reviews, I think the place has definite potential but I just think they need to get in a groove. I MAY (or may not) try them again in a few months but for right now, I would rather go elsewhere when I am in Ybor.",0
2,I'm not impressed.  It's not like the food was bad or anything but everything we ordered was food that I have eaten at other Caribbean spots in the city and I've had better.  It all depends on your palate I suppose.  For some people this might be the best jerk they ever had.  The sweet plantains were not quite ripe yet so of course they didn't taste sweet.  The cabbage was ok.  The rice and peas was a little dry but at least the portions were good.  I know of at least one other Jamaican restaurant that is a little further away but with better food in my opinion.  I think I will patronize that establishment instead.,0
2,"Poor service but it depends entirely on which waiter.  We've gone there often and the food is better than average (with one exception see below) and had good service, but this trip, it was almost 10 minutes to even get a waiter to come by and give chips and salsa and get drink order (I was 1 minute from just getting up and leaving).  The food came for the 3 of us, but not a plate in sight to eat off of when we clearly stated in the beginning that we were sharing the 3 dishes.  Watching him with other tables, he was clearly only paying attention as it came time to leave a tip, but not at other times during the meal.  That being said, we have been happy with other wait staff on other visits.The Shrimp Nachos were a huge disappointment, the limp nachos and less than generous amount of shrimp were buried under a large amount of lettuce.  I've never seen lettuce on nachos.We'll be back, but we will watch which waiter serves us.",0
5,"Ok, seriously the best breakfast I've ever had! Totally enjoyed the scrambled eggs w salmon, cream cheese & capers...delishthe grits were the best I've EVER tasted, my husband doesn't care for grits and he liked them :) He had the banana foster French toast, sooo good. We will be back for sure!!",2
2,So disappointed...pho broth was just ok and they really skimped out on the beef brisket. My husband's bahn mi pork sandwich was mostly bread again with very little meat. We've had much better bahn mi and pho in Philly/NY/NJ area and were excited to try the local Vietnamese influence. Sadly did not live up to the hype.,0
5,"It's hard to put a label on this place as they have a pretty random selection of items from jewelry to beard oil to spices. Perfect place to pick up a locally made unique gift for that person you just don't know what to get. They carry gifts for him as well as for her. Hilarious greeting cards, tons of candles, elegant scarves, cute kitchenware. Also, seasonal and holiday things were available when I visited in December.Free spiced and spiked apple cider was available along with fancy cheeses and crackers. The staff was super nice and helpful. You can tell they are proud of their inventory. They carry several items that I've only seen at local art shows.I picked a simple pair of earrings that were made from stained glass windows to give as a gift. These were only $8.00, but most of the jewelry is much much more expensive as they are one of a kind.A wreath making class was happening out back!Overall a great little shop to get something different for those people in your life who are a little different themselves!",2
4,The food is great. A true taco truck.  I only wish they would set up recycling for the cans and bottles.  Otherwise a Tucson classic.. almost better than Guero Canelo.,2
4,Good ice cream try the Cinnamon (very) popular located in the Don Caesar Hotel but has a street level entrance.   One scoop is plenty,2
2,"After reading reviews, sounded like this place was awesome.  I've been to many nail salons and this is by far not so great.  The nail tech did not speak a word of English.  I chose a nail color that I get very frequently and it came out like a completely different color and my nails are rough on the edges (ugh).   I got the feeling that they had filled this bottle with a cheaper nail polish (non-OPI).  Beyond this, the place was filthy with toe nail clippings surrounding the pedicure tubs. Will not return.",0
5,"I was looking for Oliver Peoples Sir Finley in a discontinued color.  I couldn't find them at my usual optometrists office in California or at the local Oliver Peoples store.  My usual optometry place called Oliver Peoples directly and they confirmed they had discontinued the color I wanted and didn't have any in stock either in their stores or factory.  I found the glasses on The Eye Bar website but wanted to confirm that they had the glasses in stock so I called.  Stacey said she did not have the glasses at this location but she would call around to see if any of their sales reps had them in stock in their other locations.   I got a call back about a week later and they found the glasses.  I ordered the glasses online right away and received them today, it was perfect, complete with the limited edition case.  I just wanted to thank Stacey and the staff for going above and beyond to find me these elusive glasses.  Your service exceeded my expectations and I am a very satisfied customer.",2
1,"Worst concert experience I've had. Buyers, beware. They're only interested in your money NOT your experience. My husband spent A LOT of money on an Imagine Dragons VIP package and it left much to be desired. The ""gift bag"" was filled with a small, cheap crumpled poster, plastic sunglasses, a pop socket, and a phone charger fit for a circa 2015 android. The ""crowd free shopping"" consisted of about 200 people crammed in a small area with general admission goers, and the ""hassle free entry"" took 45 minute. So, all in all I sit here really pissed about the experience, feeling bad for my husband who wanted to surprise, and the concert hasn't even started yet. Bravo CID. Thank you for seriously putting a damper on my night.",0
4,"A definite go-to place if you're in Treasure Island! Love the char-grilled oysters!  Great staff!  Big outdoor seating area and best yet, it's pet friendly so bring your pup!!!  Coming from Austin where pets are accepted everywhere this is a real bonus for me!",2
3,Employees don't make the atmosphere very welcoming. Would probably be better for the business to train their employees at least to smile. Other than that the crepes weren't bad.,1
2,"This is an out of the way location, between the university and the train tracks. We arrived at 5:30 to an almost empty restaurant but a packed bar. The bar only holds about twenty people and the restaurant about thirty and they are both in the same small room. The entire tiny kitchen is visible from the dining room. Since there were no seats at the bar, we asked for a table and the hostess was very reluctant to seat us at a table since we said we wanted to start with a drink before dinner. She wouldn't even promise to have a table for us if we started at at the bar. We had to insist on taking a table. It was awkward. The waitress was very pushy and kept coming over and picking up the menus and slapping them down on the table pressing us to hurry up and order our ""libations"". She seemed to think that the beer selection was awesome but it was actually mediocre. The whiskey selection was large, but only North American whiskeys, nothing Irish or Scotch. We ordered nine dishes. The shrimp and grits were good, but not outstanding and the portion is small, especially since they are supposed to be shared. The waitress said they didn't like the word ""tapas"" but that is exactly what they are. The pork belly was excellent and a good size and the collard greens were well prepared. The mac and cheese was mediocre and the catfish was awful. The ""mississippi mud pie"" wasn't even a pie, but a 6 ounce mason jar half filled with chocolate pudding. None of us would go back when so many better options are available. It seems that the top chef status of the person who conceptualized this place is enough to get its undeserved publicity.",0
1,"I'm laughing at all the decent reviews for this place making fun of all the low star reviewers telling us this is Kmart and not Nordstrom. First off, last time I checked, Nordstrom does not sell toilet bowl cleaner, tissue paper, laundry detergent, etc. So you should come up with a better argument. No matter which way you look at it, this Kmart is the absolute worst. They never have anything in stock, the customer service is a joke, it's filthy, it's outdated, it's overpriced for a Kmart (I can drive down to Target in Ventura and get everything at least two dollars cheaper), and filled with absolutely unnecessary things. The only reason this Kmart is the second most successful in the country is because it is the ONLY option in the Goleta/Santa Barbara area and because kids moving to isla vista who need all new furniture and supplies do not know any better when they first move to the area. No one in their right mind should give this place more than one star. I am so EMBARRASSED and DISGUSTED that this is our only option in Santa Barbara. Someone PLEASE start a petition for Target. I am begging on hands and knees.",0
3,"I've eaten here several times over the past few years and I have to say their service has gotten progressively better. When I first started frequenting this place (mainly ordering takeout) it used to take a VERY long time for my order to be ready. I would order and wait about 45 minutes before picking up and then when I would get there it would take an additional 30-45 minutes before the food was actually ready. So, I stopped going there even though the food was worth the wait. It gets old. I've tried quite a few things on the menu though I usually get the fried chicken platter with greens and potato salad, or the fried whiting with the same sides. I have tried other sides like string beans (too soft), cabbage (good), greens (good), and garlic mash (good). Their fish hoagie is really tasty and their turkey chops are as well. What I love about this place is that it is Black owned. I also love that their food is seasoned well and their portions are big enough to feed a small family. Tonight I ordered fried whiting platters for my fiancé and me and both had 6 pieces of fish with a heaping of sides. Their prices are good and I did not have to wait forever when I went to pick up my order. Nice job on the changes. I will def patronize again.",1
3,Truly delicious and generously-sized burgers! The fries are superb-great pub food. The prices are a little steep. The service is fine. My go-to spot to dine and talk for hours and it's never been too busy where that would be an issue.,1
1,This place is dirty and the wait time because you order bacon with your meal is stupid and hair in food what can I say,0
5,"I walked in to an amazing set by an all-female bluegrass outfit (with the owner, Layla, on drums) and soon the talent segued into a tears-in-your-beer and honky-tonking country four-piece.",2
5,"I really enjoy this little restaurant full of goodness. Primarily a dessert place, Seasons also serves up some wonderful food dishes which are largely modernized updates on traditional classics. I always enjoy the shaved ice when I come here. The kind Seasons offers is a different type of dessert that I haven't seen anywhere else. The variety of boba tea that they have is also very good. Among my favorite shaved ice are the hula and the koko loco. If you want half and half flavors of shaved ice in your cup there is an additional $1.50 charge for a large size. There are pre-designed concoctions or you could create your own configurations of toppings and flavors. The pre designed concoctions are a better deal.Seasons is situated on the end of a strip mall (across from a large shopping plaza with Regal Cinemas and Marshalls) with plenty of parking. The store itself is clean, bright, and modern and is kid-friendly as there are high hairs available for use. The service has always been friendly, fast, and efficient. Seasons employs an order at the counter, take number, and food is borough out to you when ready model. I can't comment on the food exactly but my boyfriend loves the quail and our friends enjoy the chicken wings which Boon touts as ""the best food item"" there. The quail is small and very flavorful and the wings are a good size and seasoned with five spice which was enjoyed by all. I look forward to many more visits with friends at this location. Check Seasons out and enjoy!",2
2,"We came here for a conference and paid for breakfast and lunch. The breakfast consisted of bottled oj and aj, bread, and fruit. We got a salad for lunch one day, a sandwich the next, and a wrap the next. On the last day, we had a banquet. With beer at $7-8, we decided not to buy anything. I was not given a choice of how I wanted my steak and it came out medium and dry. I much prefer a juicy medium rare steak, thanks. Also my friends happened to have great areas of fat on their steak, which was unfortunate. We had a window room that overlooked the pool, but the window was locked shut and the balcony was unreachable. The 3 elevators are very slow and we couldn't even find the stairs the first day because they were hidden away. The trash cans in the rooms are small enough to fit one or two bottles of water. The only restaurants around are TGIF, some italian place, Burger King, and Papa Johns. The stores in the airport close at 8, so you'd best stock up on drinks before the night begins.",0
5,"Our first time to fly Alaska & we were a bit apprehensive due to the service we received from united - we just felt Americans just don't know how to be courteous to airline passengers because there really is a BIG difference in how passengers are treated when we fly via Korea Air, Japan Airlines & the BEST, All Nippon Airways - they are amazing. But to our delight, Alaska was great!  Not a whole lot of room but that they just treated people like...people. They did not act like gods & goddesses who treat passengers like slaves who are waiting for their mercy.  Overall, a highly-recommended airline!",2
5,Love it! Can't get enough of this place. Freshest dead fish in town. Make sure you try one of the chef's special rolls. They usually interesting and quite tasty.,2
4,"Great place to get out of the New Orleans heat. Great cold drinks, yummy appetizers and tasty Po'boys!",2
4,"Found myself here after last call. It was super crowded, but the staff was great and the food hit the spot. My burger was a little rarer than medium rare, but I was into it. Fries were good. Crowd was annoying, drunk and rude but the cook was CUTE, so no complaints!",2
1,"When I first walked in, it seemed an ok place but by the time I realized it was a mistake to get mani and pedi done here, it was too late.I got shellac done and they applied 10-12 coats of paint and gel.  It started peeling off in 3-4 days.  My nails look all rough after the nail paint has peeled off.Also, the people working there were talking to each other in Mandarin.  I felt really awkward there.They used some neon green colored massage lotion or something.  Ewww.  I am never going back!",0
5,"Hailing from Australia, I've had plenty of chances to put shoe to dirt and wander around surrounded by nature. This walk was magical. I don't know whether we simply got lucky but I've never encountered such an abundance of wildlife on one walk.The swamp and marsh were beautiful. For much of our first walk we were on a raised pedestrian platform. For the later walk, it was a dirt path. Along the way on our two hour walk we saw raccoons, gators, snakes, hundreds of lizards, frogs, dragon flies, birds of all kinds, and a family of four armadillos. Incredible.",2
4,"Hassan is definitely one of the most deserving businessowners I have ever encountered, and I'm extremely proud to keep going back to support Mood Cafe whenever I'm in the area or want to bring a friend to try out someplace they've probably haven't ventured to. I stop by probably at least once a month when business brings me to the West Philly (as in, past 44th street) area, and each time Hassan is extremely friendly and willing to explain new things. He even gives large samples of his famous lassis, and I think the first time I came here he gave mine to me free! Definitely made me come back again and again. By now, I just end up getting the mango lassi because it's one of my favorite drinks (not too sugarly, but sweet enough to satisfy me and cold enough to refresh me). I usually bring a gluten free chaat back for my boyfriend, and while I'm not a big fan of chaat in general because of its spices I do enjoy nibbling a few bites off his plate, since all the ingredients are crispy and fresh. The only reason this didn't get 5 stars is that it's slow sometimes to get your order when there's a line, because there is only one employee and he painstakingly makes each order by hand (and with a smile!), so it sometimes gets me a bit impatient..but I would not compromise the fantastic service for all the quickness in the world, because that's what makes this place so great!",2
4,"Was expecting a little cheaper given the ""$"" rating on yelp. In reality two sandwiches, one cheese fries, and two standard (small!) drinks came to $29.Still the selection of sandwiches was very different to other places, tasted very good. Given the price point though we won't be coming back too often.",2
2,"As much as I like chicken wings and local restaurants here in Tucson, I don't know how many more times i can stand WOB. As for the wings they are great, always large and perfectly crispy, and totally drenched in sauce. I haven't tried anything else on the menu that I can vouch for. My issue with this place is the service, on the phone it always seems like an inconvenience that I am calling in an order and the call is always rushed. And in person when we are feeling daring enough, the staff always looks like they are in the weeds or behind on all their work. What has brought me to write this review is the mid 30 looking, tall server. Her attitude is unnecessary, her guest interaction screams lack of training and her aura if this counts for anything seems like a black cloud moving through the restaurant. I don't usually let service bother me as long as the food holds up but I just don't like her. And that's that. I'll finish up this dozen of hot, wipe my fingers and contemplate dining in again.",0
5,"I love this restaurant and eat there at least once per week. I try to get something new every time I go but every time I try something new I love it so much I want it again. The general manager Shannon is very accommodating. I usually eat at the bar and the bar staff is very friendly and will go out of their way to make you feel welcome. Today I had the blackened  redfish etouffee which was awesome.  The crème brûlée is pretty good too. There's a great happy hour in the bar from 3 PM until 7 PM weekdays, and from 11 AM to 3 PM on weekends. You really can't beat that.",2
1,"I'm only giving this place a one star for the convenience since it was next to my hotel.  I should have either saved my money or eaten at the gas station down the street!  I ordered the Asparagus soup with crab meat, green beans, and chicken salad wrap.  Well I couldn't even swallow one taste of the soup, yes I had to spit the mystery goo out. Tasted spoiled!!  The chicken salad had no flavor at all and was very dry. As I picked through it I found a lot fat. A total waste of money. The food ruined my appetite!!",0
2,"This place is conveniently located adjacent to Geno's Steaks.When the weather is subzero, go here, get a coffee and eat your steak in warmth.",0
4,"I REALLY enjoy the food here.Pros:1) lots of seating and spacious - you're never scrunched up against other people2) outdoor seating3) food is FABULOUS4) TONS of variety of food and drinks (e.g., more than 15 varieties of hot tea, four varieties of iced tea)5) discounts if you bring in your own cup as well as a punch card to earn free stuff6) free wifi7) seasonal foods as well - including a great blueberry season (O.M.G.!!)8) clean and well stocked9) lots of parking - always able to find a spot (and right next to a FedEx)10) locally/family owned - gotta love and support thatCons:1) with so much seating they need to invest in some sound dampening materials.  It is SO LOUD when there are many people there.  And when there aren't - you feel like other people can hear you.  I never feel like that at Bread Co. - busy or not.2) the prices are a little high.  Not a lot.  Just a little too high.That's it.  I love going to the Daily Bread.  I love how lovely they staff are.  They're very helpful and patient.  I try to meet with people here as often as possible.  My kids love it and we have never had a bad menu item.",2
1,"No stars. RUN from any thought of eating here. It has been at least three years since I was here for a very enjoyable meal. Last night I should have known things had gone downhill when I arrived on a Saturday night and only two tables were full. Twice we asked the waiter to turn the music down. We both ordered the special cream soup. It was literally cream with a bit of soup but generally tasty. The bread tasted and looked like a low cost soft wheat sandwich bread accompanied by a few moderately interesting relishes.Then things went terribly wrong. I ordered the paella. THe dish arrived coated in what seemed like tomato paste right from the can. The shrimp was good. Everything else had a bad, and hopefully freezer-burn taste. It was inedible and I am a clean plate clubber with extreme tolerance. Since I have arrived home my entire digestive tract is in an uproar. The two employees, waiter and cook, were unmoved but did offer a free dessert.After dinner I meekly and stupidly paid the bill. I went to the rest room to find that the plumbing was backed up. It was disgusting. DON'T WASTE A SUNDAY MORNING RECOVERING FROM THE EXPENSIVE MISTAKE THAT I MADE. The worse dining experience I can remember in decades.",0
5,"Great friendly staff. Store was clean. Flavors were filled and diverse. Toppings were filled and clean. Prices are reasonable. Floors are clean. They offer some nice deals and have coupons. There are 8 flavors and 26 dry toppings along with 21 wet or fresh toppings. Just to be clear, they DO NOT charge by weight, it's a flat rate per cup size. I posted a picture of the sizes and prices.",2
5,"These donuts were amazing, nothing negative I have to say about this place. I was a little sad that they didn't have my strawberry donut I was looking forward to very much. & I did get a bit of a hard time about wanting a chicken sandwich with a glazed donut, being told they couldn't do that, but hey I ended up with a chicken glazed donut sandwich which I really appreciated after being told they couldn't do. The staff was very kind and I loved walking in back to use the restroom & seeing the huge deep fryer full of their freshly made donuts!! Biting into one of their donuts was nice because they're so freaking delicate they almost melt when you eat them!!!! The texture was amazing and the chicken was even a good quality. I was very impressed & I will never look at Krispy Kreme the same",2
5,"By far the best cinnamon roll I've had in life!!! Make sure to get it heated, because they heat it ""Cream Brûlée"" style and that's the best part!!",2
5,"A menu that satisfies everyone's cravings! Clean, trendy, and delicious! I definitely recommend going early (before 9 am) as the wait tends to get longer after 9 am! But honestly, it is soooo worth the wait. You will leave there feeling so incredible satisfied!",2
2,"I didn't care for this place at all. I heard that food quality has drastically decreased since Katrina but man...  I don't know what sauce they used for the ribs, the fish and chicken were underseasoned to me, and the etouffe was watery, red beans and rice were... I don't need to go on. :(",0
4,We had my husbands birthday there. They were nice to give us a party room semi private area. Our food came promptly. Occasionally had to ask for refills but they were pretty busy and doing their best. They took pics for us on our phones when we asked and were very sweet to bring him a cake with candle in it. I ordered the Granny Smith apple salad and it was delicious,2
4,"If you are looking for a good, fresh, satisfying meal then this place will meet your needs.  If you are a pizza snob looking for the best pie, then you should probably go somewhere else.  I started with the pear and gorgonzola salad which was crisp, fresh, and rather tasty.  My entree was a personal size pepperoni pizza that was good.  The tomato sauce, pepperoni, and cheese were all high quality ingredients.  The crust was just average.   I wasn't looking for an all natural, organic, locally grown, etc. establishment when I went to Pizza Fusion.  I am much more interested in good tasting food than I am with an all natural restaurant.  That being said, I actually went to this place out of shear convenience and it ended up being pretty good.  I always enjoy a nice selection of local beer and Pizza Fusion has several on tap to choose from.  I will eat at here again.",2
5,"Where to start. The coleslaw was amazing and fresh good fresh crunch. Fries seasoned just right, tartar sauce and the FISH the  fresh, clean, battered perfect and meaty.",2

4,"I've lived  a few blocks from this place for nearly three years now, and I thank Yelp for letting me know what I'm missing out on.  I went in for lunch earlier this week to try out the vegetarian hoagie... i had the veg special. It was delicious. The roll very crispy and fresh, the flavors very strong- jalepeno, cilantro, sauteed veggies, tofu, and some sort of yellow mayo that I always think is a dessert (mango pudding?) when I see it in the case.  Anyway the sandwich is delicious, and although prices are now $4 for a sandwich (up from $1.50) its still a steal for a quick lunch.  I also tried the rice and mung beans with coconut milk for dessert- delicious, an excellent way to add a little protein to a yummy dessert. Next time you're in the neighborhood I'd recommend stopping in to support this local business.",2
4,"Very good food, good service, I felt it was rather pricey. Atmosphere was very good as well. Had the pancakes and eggs. Everyone in our party thought that their food was good.",2
1,"Arrived at 6:55 for a 7pm reservation for 8.  Waited at the host station for 10 mins while servers walked back and forth ignoring our group.  Eventually we were seated at a BBQ table with 2 grills and provided with menus, then the server (who looked miserable to be there) vanished for 20 minutes.  When he returned we were more than ready and began to order only to be advised that the BBQ grills at our table didn't work.!  Wouldn't it have been nice to tell us this when we were seated?  Since 90% of the menu items are BBQ, and that's the reason we came to this restaurant instead of the other local Korean restaurants, we asked to move to a BBQ table that worked.  We waited 15 more minutes and were seated at another table with one grill and placed the order, 7:45 at this point.  All the food came out but many of us  waited eagerly for food since they are grilling for 8 people on one small grill.  Finally everyone is served but then we sit for 20 more minutes waiting for someone to check back, offer boxes or the check.  They actually didn't ever come until one of us got up and requested it and it still took a while.  All in all a disaster of a night and will never go back.  I'd rather skip the BBQ and choose one of the many other excellent Korean restaurants in the area then sit through that again.",0
5,"Awesome meal and service. We ordered small plates and shared large plates paired with a  superb wine. The flavors were incredible and all I could say was ""I couldn't do this at home.""",2
5,"The Pancake Pantry is a great place. Expect to wait in line for .5 - 1 hour, but it's worth it. Also, if one is unable to stand for this amount of time bring something with you. If you haven't tried the Pancake Pantry, these pancakes need to be in or around your mouth as soon as possible. I recommend trying the hash-browns  with your meal.",2
4,"Far superior to Cafe du Monde in two aspects: the staff is friendly and smiles at you, there is live jazz almost always.The staff is very nice, then brings you your food if you're sitting down and there's a little wait for a next batch of beignets or whatever you ordered.Their beignets are as huge as my hand and spectacularly delicate-tasting and delicious. The chicory coffee is served in take-away cups and very flavorful. You put milk and sugar in it yourself from the little nook by the pick up section of the counter.There's quite a bit of seating in the open courtyard but it becomes very hard to come by when there's a great live jazz performance going on (which is often!). I was able to sit quickly both times I visited.Excellent, excellent music by the way.My favorite place in NOLA for chicory coffee and beignets.",2
3,Please don't be in any hurry here. Way to long to get a sandwich. The employees have no direction and take there sweet time to even get the food out to you. The food is always good. They need training at this location. 6 employees and seems only one is working.,1
5,So good. Real Mexico City style. Alambres are amazing and few Mexican restaurants have them. Very authentic. My new favorite place in Santa Barbara!,2
5,This was my first visit. Their food and service exceeded my expectations. I ordered a Greek salad with a chicken skewer and it was a generous serving and so fresh! I didn't realize it at the time but the owner was the cashier at our visit.If you are a member of the L.A. Fitness in the same complex you also receive a 10% off discount which is what I received. You can order online at their website for take-out or call in your order for take-out too if you prefer. I opted to dine in even though we planned to take out.Really fresh. Really happy. Really pleased. I will be back.,2
5,"Just another delightful stop during my New Orleans visit. Loved the look of it when we first walked in as it resembles an old fashioned ice cream parlor, Next the plethora of unique flavors. The hardest part was deciding on which flavors to choose. The mini scoop samplers are the way to go, that way you can try a variety. I got a sampler and I cannot say there was one flavor I did not like. This place is a must stop. Oh, and the staff was super friendly too, even with a line out the door. Cash only",2
3,"With all the hype and positive reviews, I made a point to check this place out. I have to only give three stars because I was not completely impressed. I got the half rib with a side of mac and cheese and sweet potato casserole. The meat was definitely tender and soft but lacking on flavour. Even tried it with the sauces they have on the tables but I still felt like the ribs were missing something. I enjoyed the sweet potato casserole more than the ribs. Overall, thee meal was good but I think over hyped.They were out of brisket when I got there so maybe my review is skewed.",1
5,"Very good pizza The owner is wonderful The place is renovated , everyone seems to be friendly really want you to enjoy your food French fries are good salad and also the chicken fingers i'm a vegetarian so I don't know too much of the other meals but I do know everything else is good and my kids love the chicken fingers",2
5,Great place. Hot dogs are really good. My kids love it. Spreckter root beer on tap is brilliant. Fine family owned small business. You can grab some good food and ice cream and not break the bank. Which is hard to do these days.,2
4,"I appreciate Midas being open on the weekends. Also, they looked over my vehicle for a fair price and were quick about diagnosing the problem. I couldn't afford to fix it there, but eventually I was able to figure out an alternative.",2
5,"From the second you walk in the door, you're greeted by the adorable woman at the counter. It seems if you come in here more than once a week, she'll know you're name but I haven't been so lucky since my visits are a bit more sporadic.My most recent discovery are the vegetarian breakfast sandwiches, which are served all day! I particularly enjoy veg. sausage w/ havarti on an everything bagel. I could actually go for one right about now... I've also had the veggie club sandwich and my other half has enjoyed the chicken cheesesteak hoagie and the chicken salad on a croissant. Everything always taste fresh, they are priced really well  (I think my favorite bagel sandwich I mentioned is $2.09-2.99- cheaper than wawa!). The people at the deli are super helpful, offering menus if you can't read the one on the wall and will make great suggestions and accommodations to your needs and want.Don't forget to grab a really great snack too while you're there- they have amazing chocolate bars, an incredible drink case, tons of chip varieties and those addictive hi-chew candies in every flavor.I know i'll be back here, who doesn't like fast / delicious / attentive service?",2
1,"Never been to this location before, never had a problem with any other location. It was almost full but there were a handful of tables open. We began to seat ourselves and was told we could sit anywhere. They came and took our drink order pretty quickly and we received them within a few minutes, the girl who delivered our drinks said they would be back to take our order.  I'd say it was almost 10 minutes before they finally came and took out order. I started to wonder who our waitress was because 2 different females took the drink order and delivered them. Finally, one of the females came and took our order, so we must have been there for 15 minutes at least before our food order was taken. 10 minutes had gone by and a lady got sat in the booth next to us. Another 10 minutes later, she got her food before we did. So she got there after us, ordered after us, but received hers before us. Our waitress refilled my husband's coffee twice the whole time and she asked if I wanted a refill on my soda, I shook my head no and she could tell we were wondering where our food was, she says your food is almost ready, the kitchen is overwhelmed right now. But there was only maybe one new customer that came in since we had been there. I told my husband if we didn't get our food in the next 5 minutes, we would just leave.  So, 40 minutes and no food, we walked to the register and asked if we could pay for our beverages and our waitress said our food was almost ready. I said that we didn't want to wait anymore and she said we didn't have to pay for our drinks and we left. No apology, nothing. Im thinking either our waitress forgot to enter our order, or, the 3 cooks in the kitchen just wasn't concerned about how fast the food was being cooked. They did not look flustered, so I honestly don't know what the issue was. Won't be returning. Waste of our time.",0
5,Very surprised as this was by far the best butter chicken and aloo goobi from any Indian restaurant in the past. Service was a bit slow but worth the wait once the food came.,2
5,"If there is any place that will give you a taste of quintessential Santa Barbara, this is the place.  The location is amazing, the service is excellent, the food is fantastic.  If you like burgers, the Paradise Burger with cheese is for you.  But don't think this menu is limited.  The offerings are varied and each is excellent.  This is my go-to spot in Santa Barbara and I highly recommend it.",2
5,Randy did a great job on the tour and incorporated some sights regarding the history of the city as well.,2
5,Got a new muffler and tailpipe. Service is top notch. Price was extremely fair. I have already recommended this place to several of my friends.,2
1,"Our server was awesome. Very tentative and extremely nice! That is the only thing saving this place plus the maple wings were delicious. Now for the bad part. We paid 35 dollars for the ""piano guys"" to sing a song to the birthday girl. We had 3 options of songs that we wanted to hear. They called our birthday girl on stage and began to sing a rendition of Aladins whole new world. (Which was not one of the songs we had picked) The song quickly turned to a absolutely disgusting remake. The piano guy sang so our birthday girl about opening her thighs,tying her up, filling holes, splurging on her face, and cumming in her hair. It was even worse than that. Her husband and family including parents were in the crowd but luckily couldn't hear to well because the sound system is terrible. Our birthday girl even stopped the piano man and told him to stop and he continued and made it even dirtier. It was disgusting, offensive, and embarrassing. Trust me we are not prudes by any means but this was way too far. It completely ruined the experience and we all immediately left. We spent our time and money there only to have the birthday ruined. Also for 35 dollars we paid we only heard 1 of the songs which they only sang  part of.",0
4,"The customer service was great. Only rating this place 4/5 stars because the pita was a bit hard, which made it difficult to chew, and the setting was a bit crowded (which they obviously can't help)! But a nice thing is they deliver or you can get pick up. The smoothie was SOO good. Also, you can tell falafel sandwich had fresh ingredients! And the portion definitely met the cost. I would order from here again!",2
5,"Great environment, wonderful owners and great food. I tried the tortilla española and ate it ""cuban style"" where you put portions of the tortilla on Cuban bread with a layer of mayo. Delicious!",2
1,"Wholeheartedly agree with the other 1 stars. I ordered my graduation attire that I had to buy (if you are an academic, just need to have them). I signed an order form with an already outrageous amount on it (approaching $1000), and then they charged 15% more than that, unannounced. I tried to contact them but no response. I ended up filing a complaint with the division of consumer protection. Avoid if you can.",0
2,"This bar is such a disappointment. It has a great location, the decor is cool, the food and drink menus are fairly extensive but it is all ruined by the two miserable bar tenders who's face I suspect would crack if they dared smile. I don't need my bar tender to be all up in my grill, but preferably not scowling at me would be a nice start. After giving it several try's I won't go back there now for fear of getting the hairy eyeball from one of the two poisoned dwarfs. They seem to expect us to pay them to ignore us, get our own cutlery, give us evil stares, get the order wrong and not bother them while the stand around with each other.As I said above this place has great potential but is ruined by the servers.",0
4,"Menu is small, but the was pizza delicious.I think the paper dishes and plastic cups could be replaced with real dishes and glasses since it's an eat-in restaurant.",2
3,"I was in town for business and too tired to venture out and find something. Since I was staying at the Hilton next door, I decided to go out of convenience. I thought I would keep it simple with a burger and a beer. I'm always a sucker for a good burger!  I'll say that the burger meat itself was cooked to perfection (medium) with some great smokey flavor. However, the accompaniments were not so impressive. The bacon was limp, there was very little cheese, the bun was dry and crumbly, and the fries were barely warm and limp. If they had taken the time to prepare everything properly, it could have been amazing. For an $18 burger, I expect there to be a little more attention to detail.",1
5,"Armando was magic! We recently got married 08/29 at Bacara Resort and Armando (along with Shauna) were an integral part of our dream wedding! Armando was a pleasure to work with along the whole process and offered so much advice that was truly KEY in executing our vision. Armando worked well with us and was a true professional. He is very well known in Santa Barbara and it was always reassuring to hear that he was great to work with! His recommendations and sage advice kept us in line and on target with what we wanted. We were very particular about A LOT of aspects of the wedding and he really was amazing at negotiating and compromising with our goals in mind. Shauna and Armando really were very organized and on-point come wedding day! We couldn't have asked for a better experience! Thanks!Plus, Armando can get down on the dance floor! ;)",2
5,"Had such an amazing FIRST visit here today, the staff were very nice and enthusiastic. Did the entire bottle option for mamosas and it was such a deal. Breakfast was AMAZING. We will defiantly be going back!!!",2
4,"I enjoyed Grand Isle so much that I came back twice during my one week stay in New Orleans!  Highly recommend sitting right up at the bar so you can watch the oysters being shucked - very cool!Trip One:It was my first night in New Orleans and I was starving!  I went on Yelp to see what was around my hotel and noticed that Harrah's casino was right across the street.  Having been the Harrah's in Atlantic City several times (more times than I'd like to admit), I knew that there had to be good restaurants associated with the casino.  I strolled into Grand Isle around 7pm on a Tuesday night, and thankfully it wasn't busy.  I took a seat at the bar and ordered my first local beer - the Nola Blonde.  For an appetizer, I ordered the shrimp gumbo - how touristy of me!  It was really good!  Everything shrimp gumbo should taste like.  For dinner, I decided on the house made gator sausage po boy.  OH MY GOD amazing!  The flavors worked so well together and the gator sausage was delicious.  I knew instantly that I'd be getting this again before I headed back to PA.I'm not sure if martinis were on special that night, but I saw a ton of them being ordered.  The ladies next to me got louder and more hilarious as the night went on, so I'm assuming the martinis were pretty good haha.Trip Two (two days after trip one):My boyfriend arrived in New Orleans and I told him I had to take him to a few, great restaurants I had tried earlier in the week.  We headed over to Grand Isle!  For an appetizer, we got the Isle Sampler of oysters.  All of them were delicious, but the oysters fulton (with bacon, cheddar, and onions) was my favorite.  So good!  For entrees, I once again ordered the gator sausage po boy and my boyfriend got the shrimp caminada po boy (which had apparently won an award at the po boy festival in the past year or two).  You've already read my review about the gator po boy, so let me tell you about the shrimp caminada:  IT WAS DELICIOUS.  Asian herb slaw was amazing and the shrimp was plentiful.  I can see why this won awards.We spoke with the bartender a little bit, who was a super nice guy.  Turns out he's from NJ, so it was nice to run into someone from our homeland.In short:  Go to Grand Isle.  Get some oysters, shrimp caminada po boy, the gator po boy, and a lot of beer (and maybe some martinis? haha).  You won't be disappointed!",2
5,"Visited Mr. B's on the last night of a bachelorette party. Walked in at 8pm with 5 people and were seated immediately. It is definitely a splurge, but well worth it. Between the 3 of us we ordered a moderately priced wine, 3 filet's (you can change around the side orders if you want. The potatoes and asparagus were awesome.) Another friend ordered the pork chop, which was about 5 inches thick, and came with a soy/ginger sauce. I wasn't impressed with the pork chop but the filet was a great size and excellent. Only thing I should have requested more of the sauce that came with it as it was great as well. This was a great dining experience and I'm looking forward to going back on my next NOLA trip.",2
4,"We stayed at the Four Points for 3 nights in November, while here on business.  Nice hotel, and a good experience. Check in was a breeze.  We had a good price on the room via my Sheraton/SPG member and AAA discount, which included the free breakfast.  The hotel is literally 5 minutes from the airport, and there are several other hotels right on the same block.Staff was friendly and helpful.  Room was fine, parking easy, quiet at night.",2
5,"Paragon BJJ and Kickboxing is hands-down an amazing gym. I decided that my daily routine needed a little something extra to keep me motivated, while still getting in a great workout. I looked online for kickboxing classes in Santa Barbara and stumbled upon Paragon. After reading the various Yelp reviews, I decided to sign up for an orientation class, initially for the Kickboxing program. Sean Apperson, the co-owner of the gym, quickly responded to my email and worked around my full-time job to schedule a one on one class. I then expressed through email that I was also interested in the Jiu Jitsu program at Paragon, and he was extremely open to provide an introduction to both sports.Let me start off by saying that I have no background in martial arts or wrestling. I am female who has stayed active my entire life, but starting a new sport with no previous experience can be very intimidating, especially when there are a lot of guys taking the classes. When I walked in my first day, Sean was in the midst of a training session and was rolling with a female purple belt.... it definitely intrigued me. Sean looked up from the mat and proceeded to introduce himself with a big smile on his face and right away I felt at ease. We started with an introduction class in Jiu Jitsu and my nervousness disappeared when I realized how Sean went out of his way to make sure that I was comfortable. He was extremely encouraging throughout the training, we worked on basic technique and even laughed when I made a fool of myself (which happened a lot that first day). When the introduction class was over, I was so excited that I had found a new sport and signed up to join the gym right away.After that first orientation class, I continued to attend beginner classes with nerves about how the training would go and how other athletes would perceive me. However, those nerves quickly faded after building a friendship with my fellow classmates and instructors. Everyone at the gym is extremely welcoming, approachable, and willing to work with you regardless of your level of training. 'Family' is the word that comes to mind when I think of the athletes at the gym because there is a feeling of love and respect for each other, while still pushing each other to succeed. It's a great feeling when you walk into the gym and the instructors and other athletes greet you by name and have actual conversations with you.Also, Paragon is a very clean facility. They have a huge mat space, boxing ring, weights, cardio machines.. and they have just expanded into a bigger space, which is very exciting!! The large mat space is great for the classes and the locker rooms are clean and tidy. The shower area may be nicer than my shower at home! It's open 7 days a week and they offer classes at different times throughout the day, so you can work around your schedule.I am so glad I joined Paragon BJJ and Kickboxing. Not only have I embarked on a new lifestyle, but have met an amazing group of people who are inspiring and fun to be around. I would definitely recommend Paragon to anyone, don't hesitate and sign up!",2
5,"One of my favorites in downtown Franklin! Tried a bunch of stuff on the menu but the rusty bucket is always my favorite.  Everything I've ordered has tasted great and been of high quality. I've also always had good service and usually recommend it to folks from out of town! Neat atmosphere, especially when the weather is nice and you can sit outside by the wine bar area!",2
5,"I LOVE Katies.   This is a neighborhood locals place with a serious chef and a great menu.  I've been there at least 6 times.    Definitely have the grilled oysters.   The veal with a marsala cream sauce over pasta is one of my faves.  You can create your own pasta ingredients and there have to be 15 or 20 choices.   The po boys are great too.   The same goes for the pizza.  I'm from Chicago and I'm a snob on pizza.  This is the best pizza in NOLA.  The ingredients are super fresh in everything that they make.  It's a great sauce, quality cheese, etc.   They were the only place where I had a pizza that was perfect.   I had sausage, shrimp, and red peppers on my pizzas.   Pizza in the south generally has a doughy crust.  In Chicago, the only pizza you'll get like that is a $5 pizza pizza or pizza hut.    Katie's was the only place where I got a great pizza with a crispy thin crust.   It was the only pizza that stood up to my faves at home.   If it's nice, sit at the 10 or so tables outside.  After a few visits, they welcomed me and my dog as family.   Say hi to Murphy, he took great care of me.",2
4,"Bailey's range yet another great product from Mr. Bailey. The choice of burgers is great whether you want beef, bison, or chicken.  The beer selection is great loaded with alot of local craft beers. The homemade dipping sauce are all unique and awesome.This restaurant is great for kids....I repeat great for kids....",2
4,I love milk and honey! Big sign right in front. Walking inside to see some great designing. The store build out is very clean and great attention to detail. The menu ranges from brunch items to cold pressed juices. We got the fried chicken biscuit and the mean & green juice. It was really good the biscuit nice and fluffy. Chicken juicy and crispy. The juice was lightly sweet. I would definitely recommend this spot for brunch. Recommendation: fried chicken biscuit / mean & green cold press juice,2
4,"We consider Marathon to be Philly's diner. Yummy comfort food at a good price. Tonight, sweetheart loved the matzo ball soup, which is 5-star. I really enjoyed the turkey plate with mashed potatoes and cranberry sauce.  Sweetheart's salmon salad had a lot of yummy ingredients, but the salmon was a bit dry. Marathon is a perfect go-to spot for basic foods that I could make at home, if I cared to cook!",2
4,"Great wings and fries here. They have about 8 different wing flavors (e.g. lemon pepper, garlic Parmesan, hot honey, teriyaki, etc.) It's a real dive place, but if you love wings give this restaurant a shot. I would definitely eat here again.Tip: Tuesday is $.30 wings up to 15 wings with a purchase of a beverage. Line gets busy between 7-8:30 p.m. so expect to wait 20-30 minutes if you have a party of more than 2 people.",2
1,"BEWARE!  ZERO STARS! Do not buy here! Only received part of my order.  I called to advise them that I did not receive all of my products. The small box had 8 of the 9 items, and a blow dryer would not fit. They told me to send a picture of the invoice they sent me, and they would respond by email.  72 hours later I received an email that they confirmed that all items were shipped and they could not assist me.  I called a second time and the lady told me to call the Post Office for further assistance and that the post office is responsible for my lost item.  I asked how many boxes were shipped, and she replied ""one"".  I informed her again that the box I received had the small items in it and could not hold a blow dryer.  She said there was nothing she could do.  They reviewed a video and it showed the items being packed. I was placed on hold several times. She told me to take a picture of the package box used to ship the items and email it.  I sent the pictures of the box with a Capri Sun package beside of it to show that a boxed blow dryer would not fit in the box.  Have not heard anything several days later.  Very frustrating!! Horrible customer service and very offensive. They accused me and the post office of stealing items.",0
4,"In short: Nice atmos, great food, nice portions. Mexican/ Spanish fusion Latin cuisine I suppose you could call it. On a recent getaway with my sig other in Montecito we came to this place on some Yelp recommendations. 5 stars for the food and portions. Wine list a little overpriced...They lost one star and ended up with 4 because the waiter didn't quite know if the plate had anything hot on it which I specifically asked NOT to have on my plate. Not into hot and spicy foods... Sure enough on a bite my head was nearly burned off to the neck from some burning hot green pepper in the mix... so I didn't appreciate that. That's a slack oversight on the part of the waiter. He obviously didn't mention it to the kitchen.For lunches and brunches they have a nice outdoor seating area as well. Also a full bar inside. They also have a totally separate cute little building, a private VIP dining area for parties / meetings and such but with a $500 min spend.We had a salmon and a seared sea bass entree. So, for two with an appetizer, two glasses of fine Napa Valley wine, a port and dessert to finish up our total bill with tip came to $100.",2
3,"Disappointed.Cons - champagne raspberry cake was not good...at all. So dry,bland, not sweet (maybe meant for a refined palette, not a sweet lover like me) Frosting was whipped,very bland, tasted like shortening. My mistake for not reading that it was a whipped frosting (I prefer buttercream, unfortunately almost all of the cakes that day had whipped frosting.)- Very pretentious, you probably need to be a ""somebody"" to be welcomed here- Plenty of workers, but did not seem very organized. Yes they were busy, but not THAT busy Pros - absolutely gorgeous, detailed decor.          Favored the berry bar we had over the cake, glitter was a special touch    - pies looked amazing, but the people next to us said their cherry pie was very jelly.          A really beautiful place, but unfortunately that is what you're paying the high price for, not amazing tasting cakesPlease note // this review is coming from someone who lives for cake :D",1
4,"Been here a couple of times and it's never bad. Crab fries are always a good choice, but I think they might want to try to remake the cheese so that it doesn't harden so quickly for dipping. Awesome sports bar for the guys and the place is always packed. I love the atmosphere. Can't ever go wrong with their huge portions of mussels for such a good price! Got the chickie's riverboat clams before, not really worth the money and they were okay. chicken parm sandwich is alright. The magooby sounds weird (contains shrimp, pickles, fries, onions, cheese), but it was actually a very interesting combo and i liked it. the lobster cheesesteak is alright (lol doesn't really taste different from the regular cheeseteaks though)will be back from time to time!",2
5,"Checking in again. Just got my road bike in and out on same day service. Admittedly I couldn't get my brakes dialed in, but they did!I feel welcome when I'm here. Thanks again Reno Cycling!",2
4,"This place was perfect for kids of all ages. There are so many great things to see and everything was very modern and up to date. I was impressed with all of the exhibits and information available. There were so many things for the kids to play with. Lots of family restrooms, which made it easy for our large family and free parking was definitely a plus.The only con was the cafeteria. It is not set up to be very user friendly at all. I think it's needs to have a better lay out with better information to explain where to get all the different kinds of food or just make one area to get the food instead of having to wait in 5 different lines.",2
5,"Of all the restaurants we tried in New Orleans, this was by far our favorite. I had both lunch and dinner on two separate occasions. The service was wonderful, the ambiance is cozy but alive. Make sure to call ahead and get a reservation over the phone if opentable looks booked. Their lunch special spicy fried chicken is a must have! If you are a party of two or three, ask for the corner booth by the window. Best table in the house.",2
5,Lunch special is a great deal. Jaguar roll and Shrimp Tempura roll were fantastic! Best sushi place in Indy.,2
3,"I know I know, silly as it seems, I have not had the pizza here!  but I did get a tortilla soup and 1/2 a Mediterranean salad.  The soup was really yummy with a sprinkle of cilantro and avocado on top.  the salad was more ""eh"", I think the dressing that comes with it is too salty.  But I am looking to go back for the pizza!  Hopefully they can make a cheese-less one!",1
5,"My family and I have been going to this restaurant for a few years now and my parents are very good friends with the owner, Eddie and his wife, Mary. It used to be know as Long Wong's but just recently had a name change because of it's location. You can go to this restaurant and have the very best wings in several different flavors. Ranging from Teriyaki or Honey Hot to your traditional Mild and Very Hot these wings are crispy and juicy all at the same time. If you are not up for wings they have great hamburger, hot dog, or chicken strip baskets served with very tasty fries. I absolutely love their fried zucchini and fried mushroom appetizers with ranch dressing. The atmosphere can get pretty wild during any Arizona Wildcat game as the owners are big fans. You can even just stop in for a drink at the bar and some chit chat. We have ordered their wings in very large numbers for special events and they have always had our orders ready on time and just the way we ask for them!",2
5,"A coworker took me to lunch here; this was my first time visiting a Firehouse Subs restaurant. The restaurant was clean, and the servers were very friendly and attentive. My sandwich (meatball) was served promptly and was very fresh and hot. The wheat bread was awesome. They have one of the new pop machines that lets you pick from several dozen flavors. The variety of subs leans to the healthy side. They have only white and wheat bread. There is a slight bit of uniqueness to their subs, but mostly they are pretty standard (more like Subway than like Which Wich). I think the price for a medium sub and drink is a bit high: $9. A great place to eat for a change up on sandwiches.",2
4,"When I decided that St. Joseph's wasn't the university for me and I was going to leave the area, I knew really the only thing I would miss were the friends that I made (obviously) and cheesesteaks from Larry's.  Being that it was just across the street from campus, it was the easiest dinner one could find if they missed dinner in the dining hall.I think I gained much of the beginning of my ""freshman 15"" because of Larry's!  Popular among many SJU students, you will find a younger crowd usually occupying the tables chowing down or waiting for their order to be done.  The cheesesteaks are big for the price that they charge and they are always stuffed!You can't find cheesesteaks like that anywhere but Philly!",2
5,"A nice group who are serious enough to make sure our kids are safe during the lessons, but fun enough that the kids still love it.",2
5,"I don't often eat ice cream. But, when I do; I go here. The first time I went there last year a neighbor told me about the pumpkin. I tried it and it was the best ice cream/custard I had ever had. The staff are pleasant, courteous, and energetic. On my trip there yesterday they were giving 10% of proceeds toward a dog rescue I'm involved with. I was impressed how comfortable the seating area is despite being on a busy road. Cute find here in tarpon springs. Check out the way the cone lights up at night with cute sprinkles.",2
4,Really loud live music...but a much more subdued bar on the second floor where you can actually hold a conversation.,2
5,"I am a huge fan of Gennaro's. It's got a thin crust, sweet and rich tomato sauce along w fresh mozzarella cheese. Also, the meatballs are excellent. Can't say enough about how much I love it here. Also, the decor is vintage and adorable. I have yet to be disappointed with Gennaro's",2
3,"Okay, we were off to a bad start.  Party of 9 (4 adults & 5 kids ages 8-12).  It wasn't packed ( but we were packed in a kind of wrap around booth).  We were there an hour before our food was served.  The waitress kept up with drink refills and apologies.  5-stars for her!When the food finally arrived it was hot and impressive in both taste and presentation.  The burgers were mile-high with toppings, and the kids meals satisfied our big kids. I would say worth the wait but that wait was way too long with no visit from the management.   I'll come back for the Cowboy Burger and hope for the best.",1
4,"Calzones were awesome, going to order the apple pie calzone next time.Alison may have ordered the Duke, and I went with the Meat Me in St Louis. Both were good, and they had a good beer offering.",2
3,"3 stars for food, 4 stars for service.  When we walked in, we were greeted by friendly, welcoming staff.  They gave us menus and answered any questions.  We ordered and sat outside.  The inside has only has a few tables and there are a few wooden picnic tables outside.  Very relaxed atmosphere.  They have tacos and bowls. They have small selection of beer, only bottles and cans-no drafts. I had the sangria and it was very average. The food came out super fast.  I had a bowl that had shrimp, rice, beans, guacamole, salsa, and queso fresco.  Nothing to write home about.  It came with a side of tortillas and those were delicious- actually the best part of the meal.  The bowl reminded me exactly of Chipotle, but I think Chipotle might actually be a little stronger.  My husband had tacos.  Again, nothing special.  I do feel the tacos were a bit over priced (3.50) for what you were getting.  Taco Bus taco's cost the same, but the taste is head and shoulders above.  The food was fresh, but it was just ""missing something""... Would not return with the amount of other authentic Mexican options in the area.",1
5,"Bought my beautiful new bike from this shop a few weeks ago then promptly crashed it (curse you, trolley tracks!). I brought it back to the shop this afternoon to see if there was any way they could try to fix the front basket, which was pretty mangled, and to give the bike a once-over to make sure it was safe to ride. I was expecting to have to leave the bike with them for a few days, but the whole process took less than a half hour. Not only did they fix the basket (not perfect, but pretty damn close), but they also fixed the gear shifter that was a little out of whack... FOR FREE.  I couldn't believe it. I also want to note that everyone in the shop- from the owners, to the sales people on the floor, to the mechanics, to the dog that greets you at the door- is so friendly and welcoming. I am so happy I found them.",2
5,Coming from California it's been hard finding authentic Mexican food but my search is over. This place is delicious  I live far from this place but it's worth the drive for sure. Everything on the menu is good! Plus the service was excellent  unfortunately I didn't take pictures because I was hungry and the food looked amazing lol next time,2
5,"My daughter was married at the Presidio Chapel in May, 2015. The wedding was magical and we were all treated really well by Rain Longo(she coordinates special events in the Chapel). She was very patient, supportive and enthusiastic. The chapel itself made for an outstanding and very authentic venue. My daughter and bridesmaids were able to get ready in a beautiful adjoining room. The rental of the Chapel included use for 6 hours and it was very affordable. Thanks to all for making this special day so perfect. Thanks!!!!",2
4,Great location and a great staff.,2
5,"My fiancé and I stayed at this hotel for 3 days and 4 nights for the Epicor convention. Stunning view is an understatement. Every square inch is covered in indoor lush tropical gardens, rivers, ponds with koi, and several waterfalls. Being the incredible size it is, you must carry a map or stop at their map stations to figure out where you are. Every where you turn, is an incredible photo opportunity. This a place of intriguing explorations of multilevel curiosities. It takes a small village to keep this resort running. Truly the Disney world for adults. Staff is trained to smile and offer warm hellos as you walk by, offer professional prompt service, and jump to their feet if you say ""boo"". I don't know how the staff does it. I wouldn't be able to do it. I don't know able you, but I don't clean toilets with a peppy smile. Perhaps supergluing their faces with a permanent smile and a secret record button they press when you walk by. There are many many different bars and restaurants to choose from. Anywhere from fun casual to trendy to fine dining. The banquet food offered everyday was a hit or miss. The quality was there, especially for banquet food, but it mostly depended on your personal taste preference. We visited 2 restaurants and even room service. Each was very good and service was on par. Downside is that everything is extremely expensive. A dollar store type of cheap tre semme travel pump hairspray was almost $7. So don't forget your hairspray or deodorant people. I was already expecting inflated prices in the stores and bar because of the location, however, we almost peed our pants when we got our drink bill. $67 for 4 cheap bicardi and cokes. I'm scared what the bill would have been had we ordered a high end liquor. So back to the convention for the free drinks we went. I visited the spa. 20% gratuity was included in the bill. Which is ok. I would have tipped 18-20% anyways. The anti aging facial was more expensive than most spas, but I'd have to admit, it was worth it even tho I broke out in some kind of rash under my lower lip. I swear I'm not allergic to any products I've used before! Oh well. Nobody's fault. I would still go back. My skin felt radiant afterwards. The downside is that the resort is nowhere near downtown Nashville. The entire inside of the resort is a giant greenhouse for their incredible species of plants. So expect it to be very warm and humid. Expect to dish out a lot of money on food and drinks. I was not able to stay over the weekend, but I would have liked to seen a bit more entertainment walking the miles and miles of tropical paths. It would truly be comparable to a Disney resort, with no reason to leave, for adults if they had some kind of entertainers. They definitely have the room and atmosphere to accommodate some nightly entertainment. Perhaps some live music in one of their wonderful gazebos? Actors in costume greeting guests? So after my ridiculous blabbing, I would say that the staff is unbelievably amazing, there is no reason to leave the resort if you are staying only a few days (unless you are seeking entertainment) I don't recommend this for children. They would definitely be bored.",2
3,"Went to the newest addition to Japanese food on the north side, early on a Wednesday evening. It's nice to have another option in the area, that isn't Sakura or H20, and who doesn't love a restaurant where their ""mascot"" is an octopus dressed as a hibachi chef?The decor reminded me of something out of a Sims game - black, red and futuristic, a refreshing style for a city that is often full of stale interior design for restaurants. Lots of fancy LED lighting and a bit of tacky fish oriented decorations too, but, it's nice and comfortable and contemporary.  Even the music playing over the loud speaker was downtempo, providing a ""big city"" feel to the establishment.We were greeted instantly, and seated in the dining area, being that we were here for sushi and not hibachi. All the hibachi tables were being used though, either by groups or couples.  They also have a larger hibachi in a private area for large groups.My friend had some spicy rolls and really enjoyed them. The presentation was clean and crisp. I had some sashimi and the fish was fresh, generous and delicious. I went to Sakura two days later alone, and the nigiri tasted fishy, when the salmon I had at Tomo was fresh and sweet, as salmon should be. I also had the shrimp tempura appetizer which featured two very large prawns (biggest I've had in the city!) and a nice mix of veggies. They were tasty as well. The service was a bit slow, but, needs were met when requests were made. They also have a somewhat vast (for Japanese) wine list and they make fancy cocktails such as mai tai's. I look forward to trying their hibachi and furthering my menu experience, glad to have Tomo here!",1
5,"I've been in the Carollwood/Tampa area since 1988 and it surprises the heck out of me that there are still great places tucked away that I've not only not been to but also not really heard of.  I saw Gio's listed on a list of italian restaurants in the area and decided to try it out.  Gio's is towards the back of the set of strip stores anchored by Marshalls just north of Waters.  In fact, coming from the north, I was directed by the GPS to take the left off of Dale Mabry onto Humphrey, then a right on N. Himes and a right on Waters and pull into the area by Gold's Gym.  This actually turned out to be the best way there considering the work traffic heading north around 6 pm on both Dale Mabry and Waters..  We got there around 6 pm on a Wednesday night and the place was somewhat empty.  There were about 8 other customers seated at one table and that was it.  By the time we left, around 7:00 pm, another 20 customers had piled in and were seated.  My wife and I started off with two glasses of California (Foxbrook?) Cabernet wine and a Caprese salad.  The salad was 3 slices of tomatoes and mozzarella in a vinaigrette dressing and chopped basil on a bed of mixed greens.  The dressing was a perfect mix of balsamic vinaigrette oil.  I hate it when the vinaigrette is over powering and too sharp.  This wasn'tMy wife had a entree of eggplant parmesan with a side of linguine pasta.  Half eaten and half came home.  Was it good?  ""yes, indeed"".  She is a Tiramisu groupie at heart and finished with that as dessert.  Timamisu?  ""excellent, creamy, flavorful"".My entree was the Veal Bellavista which was a veal scallopini sautéed with mushrooms, artichokes, capers in a lemon butter sauce with a side of sautéed mixed vegetables.  Excellent.  The cabernet was a subtle cabernet, not an overpowering one that tastes great with a large grilled steak so it complemented the entire meal.  I finished with a double expresso.  Service:  attentive but not overbearing.  helpful and willing to hold a conversation with you if you so enjoy.  Otherwise, respectful.  Atmosphere: great, simple decorations and pictures, background Italian music at this time of day.  Price:  somewhat pricey but worth it for a special day or that once a month visit.  Going back:  Definitely.  While we were there a friend of mine facebooked and said he would be in the Tampa area next month and wanted to hook up.  Why not here?",2
4,"Custard was pretty good! What's shocking was, it was 8pm on December 30th and there must have been 50 people in line! Seems the locals love it.",2
4,We got free tickets to the W&W show at the tiki bar this past Sunday. Our expectation were pretty low being we've never been to a party in Clearwater but we were pleasantly surprised.  While there were tons of people there was still plenty of room to move around and places to sit and just chill. Yes people were wilding out but majority were respectful and friendly. Drinks were cheap (at least to us Miamians) $5 for beers and $7 for cocktails. The dj booth is elevated on a deck over the water which allows for some amazing views. All in all it was a good time!,2
2,"Came here with some friends during Mardi Gras. Even though it was a busy weekend and lots of people everywhere a lot of places aren't over crowded. The bartenders were just awful. The service was lacking and the pizza sucked. PROS:-They had Port-O-Potty (2) put back which made it easier for a bathroom break-Outdoor seating area-Near the parade route (convenient) CONS:-Bartenders don't take drink orders properly: they skip people, ignore you at the bar when you walk up (it wasn't that busy), lots of standing around-Bartenders didn't know what microbrew meant or IPA beers (no joke)",0
5,"This hidden diamond is fabulous and the reason going out to eat can be so fun. The food is delicious, interesting, and plentiful! I ordered the chop chicken which was a real treat. If you dine in you also get unlimited soup, and after I finished my meal, the kind owner brought me another big bowl of rice with sauce for free! (Could have just been my good looks.) this place is a diamond in the rough.",2
5,"After spending the night at a friend's place in NoLibs, I was in search of a place to grab breakfast and coffee, so I gave Red Cup Café a shot.  I settled on a coffee and an egg and cheese sandwich on an English muffin.  The café definitely lives up to its name in that hot beverages are served in red mugs, and the atmosphere is homey and low-key, just like the corner coffee shops we all know and love.  Much to my delight, as I was enjoying my breakfast (which was well prepared, by the way), the very friendly owner (?) Rick made conversation with me and we chatted for a good while, since it seemed to be pretty slow for a Monday morning.  Will definitely be back next time I am in the neighborhood!",2
5,"Where do I even begin? My coworkers and I came across this place when we ventured out of our hotel one evening. It ended up being the only place we regularly went. The staff at this place are incredible. They always seem to have enough bartenders behind the bar and they know when it's going to be busy. Service is prompt. You can tell that the management has placed an emphasis on customer service. employees are very friendly, and outgoing. speaking of the management, I had the pleasure to meet the husband and wife that own this place. They are extremely pleasant and very fun to talk to. as for the smoke, yes as mentioned in previous reviews there is smoke inside the bar. You will however find that it's not the typical smoke you find in a rundown 80's dive bar with some cover band in the background. This place has adequate ventilation, and the smoke is not overpowering.  The patrons that frequent this establishment all seem to be very cordial , and are there to just have a good time. I highly recommend paddywagon to anybody in the area!",2
5,"May be the best frame selection in Philly. Competent advise in frame selection. I've been coming back for years, even though it's a hike from South Philly.",2
3,"Your average bar and grill. Standard ""pub food"" and standard bar/beer selections. Nothing special, nothing bad. We'll go if we're in the area and want a brew, but won't go out of our way to stop here.",1
1,"One recommendation: STAY AWAY FROM THE MARGARITAS!For $5.00, you get a small cup of artificially flavored, watered down liquid that reminds me of the restaurant cocktail mix bottles sold at Bed Bath & Beyond.  A Mexican establishment, with a bar and expansive drink selection, should always serve decent margaritas - no exceptions.  And the service was just as awful.  Our waitress didn't fill up our water glasses once in the 3 hours we were there, and for our table of 4, she repeatedly got our drinks wrong (but because it took forever to get them, it wasn't worth asking her to correct the orders). For the same price, I can go to Bakersfield and drink freshly squeeze lime juice with premium, smooth tequila, and it comes in a substantially larger size.  So you can guess where I will be the next time I have a hankering for margs...",0
5,"I'm fussy about breakfast places. I have to say, I don't know of a better place to go.  Service is super fast, the portions are the right size and everything tastes fresh.  The home fries are not super greasy like other places, the scrambled eggs are always cooked perfectly, bacon is thick and cooked right and the pancakes are awesome! We have been there a couple of times and I have not been disappointed.Forget the big impersonal chains. For a great LOCAL place, come here.",2
4,"Best thai food in the city! Don't expect the traditional americanized version of this cuisine though. This is as authentic as you'll find around here.I've only had it to go; never actually sat there to eat, and I can't say I would want to. Every time I come in to get my food, it is extremely hot and dampy. But in any case, this is fantastic thai food!",2
3,"Eh....Let's just say I'm glad this was not my only Jose Garces stop for the weekend.The best thing about this place is the music. Absolutely awesome rock from the 60s, 70s and 80s. Tunes you know, tunes that sound like the hot sisters of tunes you know, tunes that take you back to when you played doctor with a Fisher Price stethoscope--yeah, music like that. I definitely did my fair share of Shazaaming and ""I gotta go back and listen to that album""-ing.The food itself was pretty mediocre. The boy and I did a weekend-long food tour of Philly and this was stop #65 or so, so we weren't extremely hungry coming in.We came for the duckfat fries. But, well, they looked and tasted like normal fat fries except possibly on the drier side. The cheddar sauce helped a lot but I love french fries and believe good fries taste good without condiments of any kind, so the cheddar sauce wasn't too comforting to my fry-loving soul. We then split the chicken-fried steak. Holy oversalted batter, Batman! Waayyyy too much salty batter, about 0.23g of actual chicken. The gravy was okay but nothing remarkable and the biscuits were tender but too dense.I did love my cocktail, though. Got the Philadelphia Fish House Punch and it was a good, strong, sweet cocktail. Between that and the frat boy/bachelor party table next to us, I had a pretty good time here but definitely won't be coming back next time I'm in the city of brotherly love.",1
5,"If there is a sandwich shop in heaven, it would be a lot like Blues City Deli. The wide variety of sandwiches are so delicious and the service so fast, friendly and easy, and affordable, you'll be back for more. Guaranteed. On top of the sandwiches, they have a great selection of chips and rare, cane sugar sodas. And because I'd recc. almost everything on the menu, I'll refrain from doing so.This place is exactly what a neighborhood sandwich shop should be.",2
5,"Quick service, yummy food, and a sweet view! You can't beat this place. A total local gem!!",2
5,"Our Mother's Day flowers were just delivered to my mom and I got this text from her: ""I've never heard of Kinzel Flowers but these are by far the nicest flowers I've ever gotten and they smell wonderful.""  When you make my wonderful momma happy, you get 5 stars!!!  Thank you Kinzel's!",2
5,"If I could give this place six stars, I would! They honestly have some of the best vegan food in the city. The vegan chicken po-boy rocks my world. I don't think I've ever had a vegan meal here that I didn't absolutely love. They have a spectacular beer selection as well. I also enjoy that despite being in Old City, it does not attract the douche-baggery suburbanites. Very hip and low-key. Highly recommend!!!",2
5,"This place has the best Chinese food that I have had.  Strongly recommend Wonton in Chili Oil, 3 cup chicken, and Beef with Scallion.  Always order off the authentic menu.",2
4,"Plain and simple these Tacos are the BOMB!  Never been disappointed when I visit the West Coast Taco Truck where ever they may be.  You'll think you're in Austin, TX (home of truck food) when you bite in to one of these Authentic Tacos served the way they should be.",2
5,"This place is freakin' incredible.  Atmosphere is understated and elegant.  Vibe is dressy casual with the service of a $$$$$$$ establishment.My favorites are the onion brûlée appetizer (Carmelized onion stuffed with crabmeat), the lamb (with pumpkin risotto!) and lobster ravioli.  The salad they include with every meal is also delicious.Everything is beautifully presented and just delicious.  Dessert is also amazing- I had the cinnamon roll cheesecake with was decadent but not too heavy.  Highly recommend this BYOB!",2
4,"Excellent boba, happy/friendly/helpful service, spacious dining area.I've had the mango snow smoothie with boba and matcha milk tea with half boba and half pudding at half sweetness. The matcha milk tea was perfect. Strong matcha flavor, just the right level of sweetness, perfectly cooked boba, and good pudding. I was really happy that the barista asked me about sweetness level because I didn't realize they allowed customization.The mango, I will probs not get again. Was syrupy and overly sweet (before I knew to ask for reduction in sweetness) and tasted a bit too artificial for me. I will have to  stick to the milk teas. Also wish they added a few more bubbles.The baristas are exceptionally friendly and always patient with my indecisiveness. Service is quick and drinks are always served with a smile. A smile and good milk tea definitely make my day!",2
1,"We booked a big party there and requested one particular chef way in advance. When we arrived, they would not even seat our first guests even though the place was empty. Then they finally seated everyone, and we got the worst waiter one can find. He did not get our orders, did not refill glasses, when I asked to replace my fork because there was old food stuck to it, he did not bring me another one. After waiting for our hibachi chef for an hour, I finally went to talk to the manager about this. He was the rudest, most unprofessional person I've ever met! He yelled at me, and told me he did not care if the 12 of us walked out of there, and interrupted me every other word. Seriously, I could not be more appalled at his behavior, and did not know that ""customer service"" like this existed in America. Do not profit this guy by going to this place unless you like being treated like garbage for a very mediocre food and very high prices.",0

On top of needing the smog done, I needed an oil change and the transmission fluid changed. As soon as they were done, I needed to get back home to California and I was going to register online. When I got home, i realized the smog was never performed and I had to call out of work and drive 3 hours back to get the smog done!! 0/5 rating. I shouldn't have had to pay for the smog. Never coming here again.",0

3,"Great to have a new spot in Temple Terrace. Food is good. Service is good. However, I'm not sure if they are trying to be a night club or a restaurant. The Music is so dang loud it's hard to think let alone carry on a conversation w/ folks I'm hanging out with. Turn down the music & you will get more business!",1

5,"This location is by far the best of all the Café Du Monde I've tried during my visit in NOLA. The beignets are consistently not oily and freshly cooked whenever we came here. (Been in this location 3 times in 6 days back in Dec 2017) what's more, there ice mocha and cafe mocha are also really good it's not too sweet and works well with the beignets. Wish they would open a location in SoCal.",2
5,"I visited this yummy place last weekend and still can't get the food off my mind, so I thought it was necessary to share my love of PP's food!! My family and I arrived pretty early, around 8am, on a Saturday, with two kids in tow. There was a little bit of a line but it moved along quickly and I'd say the wait was about 15 minutes long to get in. Once we got in, we were taken care of quickly by very kind servers. I ordered the Grill Cook's Medley and it was DIVINE!! The potatoes were fried up nice and crisp with a little bit of soft potato layered within the crust and covered in grilled veggies and meat. I ordered the meal with a side of pancakes and those were simply delicious-fluffy and sweet!! I'd wait an hour to get into here!!!!",2
1,"Pretty slow service and the waitresses aren't very kind. I guess I was expecting something different at a diner with high ratings but I understand it's in the middle of a tourist area. However, service should be a priority. Something that really bothered me was how much trash was left on the floor of the outside deck- it all has the potential to blow right into the ocean. NOT OKAY. I had to stand up several times to grab straw wrappers and napkins before they blew into the water. If you're going to have a waterfront/beach front business, be responsible about it. It would be a very easy fix-just a screen on the bottom of the fence. The food was good but I won't be back.",0
4,"I like this Sam's Club because it is in an excellent location and has great prices ranging from Gas, Liquor, Food, and Electronics, Tires etc etc. Their warranties are also great and are not difficult to take advantage of when you need it. I love that I can go in there and spend less than 20 dollars and have a dish for a party that will serve well over 10 people. I also like that I can drive 2-3 extra blocks and find gas significantly cheaper. For example today the gas was approx 3.70-3.79 on 86th street. I drove a few miles down the road and got gas for 3.51 there. That is extremely well worth it when you are in a budget and drive an SUV. The gas alone is worth the membership. The only reason I gave them a 4 star rating and not a 5 is because for all the hard work they do they could pay their employees a bit more. Additionally their lines tend to get a bit long at times which can be nerve-wracking especially when there are employees who want/need extra hours. Other than that kudos from me.",2
4,"I feel like such a snot complaining about a Starbucks. The staff here is great. My issue here is the guests. There are a couple people that live here. So if you were planning on sitting in one of the cozy chairs think again. They've basically claimed them as their own. Take a close look and you can see their ass prints in each seat. Seriously. And on a nice afternoon there's usually 5-10 too many highschoolers hanging around. They tend to sit outside around the Cold Stone next door which is a little bit of a relief. Where do these kids get money for Starbucks everyday? I was counting change to share a $1 slice at the local pizzeria! But otherwise, drinks made right- every time- also friendly and quick drive-thru.",2
5,Went here for a drink after dinner at Kuma's and loved the teki bar!  The $4 house margarita special on Tuesday is well worth the visit.   The painkiller is a wonderful cocktail!  Highly recommended.  Staff is very friendly and service is great!,2
4,Enjoyed traditional bowl... service good... food hot and tasty... Price was reasonable as well... I think I found a new regular lunch spot...,2
4,"This place has moved around a few times. I'm glad it's closer to where I live now.the bread is great. Get it and make it with your breakfast. It pulls apart into little bun shape rolls that is perfect for toasting or dunking. The sweet breads are just as good.  They have a ""shell"" sweet bread and a ""kiss"" sweet one that is my top picks. The ""tongue"" is more like a cookie wafer crossed with a light sweet churro. It's a nice snacking one.Butter loaf and bundt. Same buttery dense bread but in two forms. These are good as is, which is a little sweet but very tasty. I take it and fry it on a pan with butter. Yes, I go there with it and make it like a corn bread dessert.They have day old bread which is still perfect for the next few days. Stop by and ask questions if you have any. The workers are always super friendlyOH TAMALES? Yeah, they have them! Give them a call when they'll have them and come get them.They are Guatemalan style so it's made with banana leaves instead of corn husks. Much more most than you'd get elsewhere.Plenty of parking, lots of choices, perfect for just picking up a few sweet buns or a few breads for dinner.",2
5,"For the first time for Mother's Day, my hubby took me to the Civic Theatre for Les Mis.  I have seen it three other times and I was blown away!  The theater is a great size and all the ticket prices were the same and somehow he managed to get us fabulous second row middle and I could see the lines in the actors faces as they sang my favorite songs. During the final scene when the rebels are killed, I was so close I could watch for them to take a breath (they didn't!).  It was incredible how well done this show was.  The sound was AMAZING, the orchestra blew me away and the intimacy of the theater was awesome!I would definitely be back to see another show.  They host an amazing array of choices throughout the year for affordable prices and they serve snacks, beer/wine and soda/waters upon entering.  It's easy to get parking and it's very simple to find. The theater have a program for kids who are interested in the stage and they offer local actors great opportunities.  Other than being a little chilly (bring a sweater, ladies), it was a perfect experience.  I truly think this is a great place for anyone to see a show live.  It is accessible, easy and affordable.  Don't miss out on this if you enjoy theater.  I am looking forward to the next time...",2
5,"The shrimp tacos and margaritas are reason enough to come.  I have a Local Taco next to my house (on Fatherland), but drive to this location because the cook is top notch.  The bartender explained that he tweaks some of the recipes, and it works!! Haven't had anything bad here.  The margarita mix is made in-house, and you can tell.  It is super fresh.  Don't even bother getting a top shelf margarita, the house is that good.",2
2,"The staff was courteous and friendly but the prices for a battery replacement was very steep.  I've been to several places that do it for free if you buy the battery from them-here I paid over $70, plus a $30 inspection, for a service that I have gotten for free elsewhere. The work was good quality but outrageously expensive.",0

3,"Pretty good.  Fresh food, pizza had a nice crust.  LOVED the salad with the grapes in 'em.  The only thing that was a little weird:  ALL of their pizzas sounded phenomenal...exactly the way i like, with neat ingredients put together thoughtfully, as opposed to a pile of cheese and meat on a crust.  We got the mushroom pizza and the green lantern.  They each had a nice array of toppings that sounded so scrumptious.  But when I bit into the pizzas, the flavors just didn't come through for some reason.  Maybe it's just me and the stupid medication I'm on (for acne, not the crazies), but the flavors just didn't gel for me...on those two pizzas...I will DEFINITELY go back and try the others.Bottomline:  A great place for fresh food without the ""luxury"" tax.",1
5,"ONE OF THE BEST AND FRIENDLIEST INDIAN RESTAURANTS IN THIS AREA AND TAMPA. I live nearby and eat a lot of Indian food between California and Florida in my life.

I order out or eat in almost every week.",2
3,"The staff is really friendly and the facility is mostly clean but all the equipment is extremely outdated. I like a hardcore gym, I love a hardcore gym, but this one was too archaic for me to enjoy or to get a good workout. The staff was really nice and really friendly.. so I don't like to say anything bad about the gym, but I have to be honest about the facility.",1
1,"If I could rate them less than one star I would. I had the worst experience here. I felt discriminated against, disrespected, and attacked. The place was over crowded because they over sold tickets. We were asked to move from where we were standing because it would block the dancers from walking by. However, they brought out chairs from the back for other people to sit in that same exact spot. The second time we were asked to move because a couple wanted to sit behind us and couldn't see. A woman then turned a chair around and told one of my friends that the seat wasn't for her in a very rude tone. Next, two girls came in and stood directly in front of me which was also directly in front of the doorway where the dancers were supposed to enter, a server came to us and asked us to move again but said nothing to the two girls. We stated that we could not move where he wanted because then we would be blocking the view of the customers already standing there so he then asked us to move to the back of the bar where we would not be able to see anything. After that the rude woman (who told my friend the seat wasn't for her) had her husband tap my friend and ask could she switch places with me because she was too tall and blocking everyone's view. There was no room for us to switch spots so I said no and continued to try to watch the ""show."" He then tapped her again and asked did she want to sit down, she said no she was fine. He proceeded by pushing the chair into the back of her legs and forcing her to sit down. There was no staff around to assist us with these issues and there was hardly any room to try to find someone so we left before things got anymore out of hand. As we stood outside getting ready to leave a couple that lived next door overheard us talking about how disrespected we felt they chimed in and said that many of the people there are impolite and rude. I will never again in my life recommend nor visit this establishment.",0

2,I needed a diagnostic screening.  I was in and out quickly because I had a reservation but there were a bunch of mad customers in the waiting area and only 2 employees.  They were overworked.  They at least need a receptionist and another back of the house employee.  I gathered that walk-in customers were waiting LONG.,0
5,Delicious food and impeccable service by James. Won't eat octopus anywhere except here; marinated for a long time so it's very tender.   Ask for James to be your waiter. His service was as good as at a 5 star restaurant.! Don't  miss bakery attached to restaurant.,2
5,"Probably the best coffee shop I've ever been to. Everything they make is great. Their pure black and draft latte are the best iced coffee drinks I've ever had, full stop. Their drip and espresso are also very tasty and strong. If you are in the area and love coffee you need to stop by this spot. Only complaint: the line can get absurdly long. However, the staff here is some of the best around and the line moves very quickly. On that note, service here is also very friendly.",2

I ordered it ""Thai Hot"", but I don't think they really believed me. Good thing they brought extra hot pepper flakes. I hate to leave a Thai restaurant when my mouth isn't on fire. The dish was good, but just a bit dry. I really did enjoy it, but it couldn't earn top marks.",2
4,"We just spent 3 nights here in a Royal Salon suite. It was a nicely appointed, spacious, clean room. Not really a suite in that it was a single room with upgraded bath (separate jacuzzi tub and shower). The bathroom, extra space, and view were worth the 30 extra bucks per night (rates were super low the week before Xmas).The Carousel Bar was open and bustling. We stopped here twice for drinks. The first time we closed the bar down and enjoyed chatting with the bartender. The second time was around 10pm and we lucked out to snag a couple of seats that had just opened up. The Monteleone cocktail was our favorite.Prime location in the FQ to stroll down Royal and window shop on the way to St Louis Cathedral/Jackson Square/Cafe du Monde, a skip away from Bourbon St and 2 blocks from Canal for those of you who want to hit up Harrah's. It was convenient for us to venture to our favorite spots: the Sazarac Bar at the Roosevelt Hotel, the Davenport Lounge at the Ritz, and Frenchman St in the Marigny (a bit of a walk that felt good after stuffing ourselves full of gumbo).The only area that left us unimpressed were the service (or lack thereof) of the front desk. We've had better service from 3-star hotels and this place considers itself on par with the Ritz. Not so much. The perks outweigh this aspect, though, so we would stay again if another good deal comes up.Also, we used this hotel as our home base for our out-of-town wedding guests back in 2008. All shared positive reports about their stay and it was easy enough to coordinate with their special events/group reservation personnel.",2
4,"Great prices, especially being locally owned. It's obviously not going to be cheaper than, say, Walmart, for most items... but it's a muuuuuch better alternative. The employees are unusually helpful and friendly. They have a huge selection of everything. The produce is fresh. They have the usual cuts of meat, plus a section of freshly made options like stuffed pork loin, stuffed chicken, cajun burgers, blue cheese burgers, stuffed mushrooms, stuffed peppers, etc. I also feel that I should mention the alcohol selection, because I don't think anyone has brought that up in a review yet (kidding). So good... and cheap!!!The bakery is amazing, as is the deli. As soon as you walk in, you can smell the fresh-baked goods. Oh, and in addition to their regular King Cakes during carnival season, they have sugar free for those diabetics out there. It's actually pretty darn good, too, but a bit on the pricey side compared to their usual competitive prices. However, this is a novelty IMO, so I'll let that slide.The only downside for me is the narrow aisles and the parking lot where I feel like I'm going to get rear-ended, side-swiped, or possibly both at the same time by the old people in LARGE cars trying to fight over parking spaces. Do yourself a favor and park on an adjacent street, or in one of the side parking spaces if at all possible.They need to open a location on the Westbank... just because it would be more convenient for me (no, I didn't deduct stars for this - just a suggestion).",2
2,"I usually try hard to not judge a place first by reading people's reviews but instead my own experience at the place. However, today, I would have to agree with the rest of the members who rated this place 2 stars.Let me first state that this review of 2 stars is based on personal incident.-----------My husband and I arrived when there was two other tables occupied and sat down with our menus.Another couple came in after and was waited on no longer than 5 mins. I looked at the young girl who was the only one out there and kind of let her know that we were ready to order.At this point, I was already thinking: ""Wow, she didn't bother coming to us to even ask if we needed water or anything, yet she walks over to the other table who came in after us and offered drinks?!? ummm""She came over after she was done w/ taking that table's orders and bringing out their drinks to them.We told her our orders and things went smoothly during the process. After we were done eating, it was time to pay. I walked to the counter to let her know I was ready, and also showed her my groupon. She told me that the bill came out to be $3.16. I promptly and politely handed her a $5 bill and waited for her to give change back.She stared at the $5 and RUDELY (and I mean, with attitude and a scoff) said: ""What, you don't have 16 cents?""I was a little taken aback by her scoff and said: ""I do have it, hold on a sec!"" and pulled out 16 cents and laid it out on the counter.She then takes all the change, scoots it towards herself on the counter, picks up her cell phone and starts texting on it while completely writing me off/ ignoring me. The whole next 30 sec, I was shocked at her rudeness as she knew I was standing there, waiting for change of $2 back.Now, I always tip people, and I was def. planning on tipping this girl even for  poor service, but what REALLY killed me was that she EXPECTED a tip from me. The fact that she also didn't even bother asking me if I wanted change back really got under my skin. She literally just took the money out of my reach and left me hanging and started to play on the cellphone like: ""You aren't going to be stingy enough to ask me for $2 change now are you?""I obviously figured out her conniving plan and basically decided it wasn't worth my time to deal with her bullsh*t and walked out. She may have thought she ""won"" her $2 tip, but I was actually going to tip her more than $2. I guess being a bitch waitress sure can bite you in the back! --------------------FOOD RATING---------------------------Food was decent, and was well worth the Groupon purchased, for $10+ $3.16 = $13.16 we were able to get egg rolls for appetizers, a large bowl of Pho, a bowl of cold vermicelli noodles and meat with a mango drink. If it wasn't for the service, I would have given this place a 3 star, but because of the waitress and her attitude and just plain RUDENESS, I can only give it a 2 star, and I will DEFINITELY NOT be coming back to this place again.",0
5,"I thought they had closed shop when I learned they were no longer at their old location. When we saw they had only moved we had to try them out in their new down town location. I don't the know owners name but he is the nicest guy. Very friendly. The food was delicious but it might have been wise for us to confirm what we thought we were ordering. Indian food is delicious but I am horrible at remembering what I ordered before. Unfortunately this review is another victim of my not being able to remember the names of what we ordered. One dish was mostly spinach (a total hit), another was some red chicken dish (perfectly cooked but looked like it was dyed red), and naan which is everyone's favorite. If you know your Indian dishes you won't be disappointed. Kids are always welcome there. Be sure to enjoy downtown while you're there.",2
4,"Great service and amazing food. Will always go back here. The first time we went we didn't realize it was a dressy restaurant and showed up in jeans and t-shirts. Anticipating being at least relegated to a Siberia-like table we were pleasantly surprised to be put in the center of the dining room, and the servers treated us really, really well. After several return trips ( dressed appropriately!) I can tell you that all their servers I have had are very knowledgeable about the menu and the wine list, and the food is ridiculously good. Their turtle soup alone is worth going for. We often will order a bunch of their small plates because their menu is too damn interesting! Highly reccomend.",2
2,"I really wanted to like this place. Like really wanted to. But after a few trips, I've sadly come to realize that I don't love their donuts. The flavors are great and very creative, but they're just too doughy and dense for me. To be honest, when I read reviews mentioning how light and airy these donuts are, I'm a bit taken aback.Maybe I'm missing the hype and have been heading in on bad days. Maybe they just make their donuts in a style that doesn't match my taste.",0
3,"Greasy food after a night of drinking. Burgers are cajun spiced, and expect a minimum of 2 patties per burger. Kettle chips are excellent, but hard to screw those up. Service wasn't great, but not terrible either. Wish we would have known about this place earlier in the day to watch a non saints game.",1
5,"Simply the best stay you will ever have in the French Quarter.  The Royal Sonesta is conveniently located off Bourbon Street and right near everything you want to see or do.  The staff and employees are the most detailed and positive people you will visit while in N'Orleans.   I will have to say that Jabari was the most dedicated door man that you could meet on a daily basis. He was always attentive with a smile, a greeting, or a quick bit of information to get you what you needed around town.  Each day I went out of my way to greet him and thank him for helping, he always went out of his way to ensure that it was ""no problem.""  This was our first stay at the Royal Sonesta, I personally have stayed in other hotels, but this place has won me over; I will be coming back.  The rooms were cleaned with care, the beds had fresh linens daily, there was never an issue with amenities that could not be resolved.   For instance, we had a bulb burn out moments after we were in our room. Without pause or hesitation it was taken care of. All I simply wanted to do was inform them to attend to it at the leisure since we were not going to be there often anyways.. that was not good enough, they addressed it with urgent care. Wow, all for a light bulb! I am confident that if I required any additional services they would have responded the same.  It is such a contrast when you stay  there. The marble hallls, crystal light fixtures, water fountains in the lobby... all about 12 ft away from the loud noises of Bourbon street.. something you just do not expect.. but it is a welcome place when you spent most of the day carousing the area on foot, or coming in from a good night of jazz clubs and drinks.  The Royal Sonesta is simply a great place to stay at while visiting the French Quarter.  *Note* As you would expect, the parking is VERY TIGHT, so leave your big vehicles at home.. if you need to bring a big vehicle or have concerns about parking.. use the Valet, they will take care of you. For our mini-van parking was about $36 a day, but worth every penny for security and convenience in the Hotel.",2
5,Fantastic service from Jo Jo! Recommended through my insurance company there is a reason why they prefer this excellent vendor. Jo called to ask if he could show up EARLY which was great as it freed up my day. Work was performed perfectly and in record time. I hope if I need another windshield that Jo Jo shows up! Thanks Safellite!,2
3,The food was amazing but i never got everything in my order. I ordered the cheesesteak lunch special and it was suppose to come with a drink but i never received it. Cheesesteak was amazing and was cooked to perfection. The meatball parm is to die for. No other comments on the meatballs. The milkshakes i ordered they only brought me one when i ordered two but i still never got the other one. I would order from here again but afraid of not getting everything i paid for.,1
5,"Al's is located in ybor one block south of the busy 7th ave. I've passed by it so many times in the past but never realized it was a BBQ restaurant because every time I passed it previously, they've been closed. Also, the building just looks like a regular residential home when its not opened and packed with customers.  Last Friday, I made it to Al's around 8pm and they close at 9pm. Unfortunately, since it was late in the day some of the food items I wanted to order were sold out. In the end, I ordered the sausage and ribs platter with collared greens and okra, The food was so amazing and the staff was very helpful and friendly.  I will definitely be coming back very soon to try the other barbecue and side options.",2
5,"The Habit is my weekly habit. I love this place. they are fast, inexpensive, and delicious. I could eat here everyday of the week and not get tired of it. Teriyaki burger is the  greatest thing invented.",2
2,After all the great reviews I looked forward to trying Smiley's. The staff was friendly and polite. I had the falafel pita. The sandwich was hot but the seasoning was not as good as many others I have had in the Philadelphia area. I was dissapointed,0
4,"I stopped by Veekoo on my way to the Outlets. Nice Asian fusion restaurant. The sushi was unexpectedly good and is made fresh to order. The sushi bar is separate from the regular dining area. The menu is a mix of Chinese and Thai, in addition to the Japanese. The soft shell crabs were delicious considering they're not really in season. Service was excellent! In this neck of the woods I wouldn't expect to find a better Asian fusion restaurant.",2
2,"Ok here's the deal - I REALLY wanted to like this place, especially with all of the great reviews.  It's not close to me but I made the trip because it is supposedly great!  Sadly it was underwhelming from the minute we walked in the door.  There were only a few customers, and the two waitresses were watching TV and barely acknowledged us.  One of them approached but didn't say anything, she just grabbed some menus and took us to a table.  She didn't ask for drink orders or anything, just brought us some waters without saying a word.  We selected several items from the sushi menu and waited for her to return.  And waited some more.  And some more.  Finally after about 10 minutes I got her attention and she came back and took my order sheet, again without saying a word.  The miso soup came out pretty quickly but it just wasn't great.  When the sushi arrived, I noticed it was only about half of our order.  I wasn't too worried about it though, because there was only one sushi chef behind the bar and it's not uncommon for places to bring out parts of your order over time.  Still, the service was just plain bad and I won't be back!",0
5,Came here for lunch on the last day of our trip to New Orleans. It was amazing. I had the gumbo and the gulf white shrimp and cucuzza stew. The perfect way to end the trip because I really wanted to take in New Orleans' cuisine and this was just the restaurant to do it.,2
4,"Great Cambodian food in South Philly! I've been here three times (once to eat in and twice for take out) and haven't been disappointed once. The must haves: Mussels in red curry sauce (Cha Mussels): creamy, savory, and a little spicy. I poured the red curry sauce over everything.Prat-Hee: Minced pork with raw veggies to dip (eggplant, peppers, cucumbers, etc.) It's a little bit oily and a little bit salty but extremely flavorful and satisfying Chicken Curry (or whatever they have as a special): potatoes and chicken and a delicious warm soup. Perfect for winter days. Papaya salad is also great for something light and fresh!4 stars instead of 5 because I pass out every time post-meal. Pretty sure there's some MSG in there.",2
5,"Not only was the food excellent, but the people here are beyond nice-and genuine. I had eggs Benedict. The poached eggs were good but the toast they were sitting on was excellent. We were given a cream pancakes to taste test by our awesome server, Tina. I can honestly say it was the best pancake I've ever tasted. So full of flavour-vanilla, and soft aa pillow.  They melted in my mouth. I didn't even use syrup. Stellar!",2
3,"Smash burger is pretty good. They have TONS of different options - from pre-determined combos to build your own. I got mine with guac last night - YUM! It was great. They also over avocado slices, and I like that you can get either. The girl taking my order was SO NICE and awesome. She was great. The smash fries taste delicious - garlic and rosemary. However, they were oily and soggy - probably were not fried at the correct temperature. The onion rings were great. Prices are good, sizes are good. Passed a salad on my way out - they're giant!!!!",1
5,"Freaky fast as always.  Got the JJ Gargantuan and it was made within 3 minutes.  Barely had time to fill my own drink.  Love the new location with this Jimmy John's.  It is clean, the associates are very friendly (greeting me on the way in and on the way out) and the place is full of funny and entertaining signs to read while you eat.  I am sure that this place will stay busy being located right off of I-465 and by many work places.  My only regret...I forgot to get a pickle!",2
5,I've been coming here since I was a kid. Always great. Stopped by for lunch and was totally ignored. While I was not in her station Sue took it upon herself to assist me and got my drink order. The waitress I was supposed to have finally came over and asked me what I wanted. I told her I was already being helped and Sue finished the service. I was just about to leave when Sue approached me. Thank you Sue. Now I still have great feelings about this wonderful Florida institution that is Ted Peters.,2
4,"Cramped feeling, but very friendly staff! We know that WF is always a great place to grab a healthy snack or drink (today it was just a GIANT bottle of 365 Brand Bottled water for 69 cents!) when we're traveling, and this visit was no exception.",2
4,"One night my significant other and I came here by accident and drank a whole bunch of really, really ridiculous cocktails, all of which had suggestive names. We're still like, ""Remember that time we went to Absolutli Goosed and drank a bunch of really, really ridiculous cocktails? THAT WAS SO MUCH FUN."" The place looks like it used to be a bar and grill. It's been gussied up (goosied up?) with some red walls and HomeGoods artwork. I feel reasonably certain that on any given weekend, you could run into at least three bachelorette parties here. You don't go there for the decor or the clientele, though. You go there for the really, really ridiculous cocktails with suggestive names.",2
5,"GREAT brewery! This was the 201st brewery my husband and I have been to and it ranks right up there! GREAT beer! GREAT vibe! Friendly and knowledgeable staff! And perhaps most telling of all, there was a diverse crowd of beer drinkers - not only young or older or men or women! Looking forward to returning in the summer, chilling outside and making new friends!",2
2,Sad but fellow citizens in this area have no idea what good Chinese food is. Go down to Chinatown in Philly or find another spot for Chinese. Not sorry to see this place go. Hope something better moves in.,0
1,Don't go!!!! Walk a couple more feet and go to the Boardwalk Grill! Crowded crazy and definitely not clean.  We left immediately after being seated and walked a few steps to the Boardwalk Grill and had a great Lobsta roll with hand cut french fries.,0
2,"After reading a lot of positive reviews, we were really excited to try this place. We were extremely disappointed in the food. I'm going to give the place the benefit of the doubt that it is not always like this as we came in at 10 PM, but if you cannot offer quality food at that hour then don't have your kitchen open. All of our food came out within 5 to 10 minutes of ordering which leads me to believe it was not made fresh. The Caesar salad was room temperature and overdressed. The hush puppies were flavorless, and the chicken wings (3 full wings is a serving) were undercooked and barely warm. The only redeeming food item was the chicken and biscuits, which had a nice flavor profile- the biscuit was again, cold in spots. On the positive side the place has a nice hip atmosphere and the service is friendly. Unfortunately, the food was so sub par we would not consider dining here again.",0
2,"When I used to live in Philly and did not have a lot of money I went to this Indian restaurant, its cheap and you get a lot of food. While the quantity is great, it lacks quality, there are much better Indian restaurants in Philly this is not one of them. You get what you pay for, there used to be 2 other buffet Indian restaurants near this one.",0
5,"My wife and I stayed here on a Saturday night, ate a great breakfast at the cafe and then spent all day on Sunday at the spa. The massages were great and we basically just pampered ourselves all day. Chilled by the pool, ordered some wine and hummus, had a great time.",2
5,Had a gyro plate! Was delicious! Bear hummus and gyro I have had in a long time!  Lebanese tea was perfect also!,2
4,"We have and do like this place, the pool is dirty. We use this koa as a few day stop over in our travels. Hit the town etc. First time this beautiful was used by us as the weather has allowed it. And really can't buy a pool cleaner for at night to clean leaves, sand and dirt out. Cement deck is covered by dead leaves. Koa man walks around looking at women like a rooster. Lol internet is weak and a battle to use. Strange as they have really did up the place and it's that or this way. Must be weak management. Paid almost 70. For a back in",2
5,"Ohana means family, and as soon as you enter this restaurant and meet the owner teresa you will truly feel like you are just that. The food is delicious and healthy, from the meat options to vegan, you will not be disappointed with anything on the menu.",2
3,"The food was good, not great, the atmosphere was fun and lvively. Drinks were large and wine list was pleasing.",1
5,"Tyson is on point, sharp and follows through on his word. I brought an RV with a ford front end to him not only did he get me in right away but he finished ahead of time. Parts were ordered and in shop and the guys were working on it next day. I had my RV bumper replaced on the ford front end in 3 days and back on the road. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Only place I will take my vehicles, as a business owner it's important for great service. Manny and Tyson are great!",2
3,"Really good burger. I had the Bourbon Black and Bleu. It was cooked like I wanted and very tasty. I gave them 3 stars for the wait. We had a big party - 4 adults and 5 kids - and it took over an hour to get our food. Shouldn't have taken that long, regardless of how many people were at our table.",1
4,We had a calzone and the margherita pizza.  Both were delicious with a thin light crust.  Service was excellent and incredibly fast.  It will definitely become a regular stop.,2
4,"hulamom and i stayed here during her birthday jaunt and it was actually pretty lovely.  the location is pretty good, especially if you're a newbie and you don't ever want to leave the quarter.  commander's palace (hulamom's fave) was booked her b'day night but the concierge got us in...and added a free bottle of bubbly.  yay, royal sonesta!  plus there were rolling blackouts (it was july, y'all) and they loaded us up with lightsticks on our way back in every night.  very thoughtful!",2
4,"I was walking on Delaware Ave looking for an ATM and a cup of coffee and wandered into the ING Cafe. After tapping my account, I walked around a curving wall and stepped into a very open, lively and orange public space. I had an excellent cup of Peet's, free WiFi, but honestly, the people watching was so good, I got very little real work done. Great spot to crash and get a cup, excellent vibe. So nice, you will wonder if you are really allowed to just walk-in like that.",2
3,"Not a fan of cafeteria food so I will go easy on this place since it is well liked by the elderly masses.  The average age of the customers is probably close to 65. The staff is efficient and there are a decent amount of menu choices.  Not impressed with the quality of the food.  The pies look better than they taste.  Didn't try the fried chicken, but wish I had since it looked golden crispy and smelled delicious.",1
4,"i had the seafood combo-catfish (and im talkin like 5 pounds of it), red beans and rice and coleslaw.  the food was pretty damn good.  well, the real reason we walked in to this place was due to the big sign out front: ""happy hour, mon-sat, 4pm-7pm, 2 for 1""  Now THAT is what im talkin about.  i ordered a margarita...and being that i'm from California, i have extremely high standards for marg's.  wasn't bad, but really wasn't great... but food made up for it!",2
4,"I made an appointment for 2 pedicures just a few hours before for my 6 year old and I. When we got there we waited 10 minutes, which I'll admit I was irritated by, but it's fine. The ladies doing our toes were very nice and they attempted to engage my daughter. They were very sweet to my other 8 year old daughter who doesn't care to be touched and so didn't get her nails done. I got the basic pedicure, which I liked, but I think next time I'll go one up. My daughter had little flowers painted on her toes which she LOVED. The ladies were very patient and nice, and that goes a long way. The only thing that would really make this place awesome was if they acquired a couple of cute kid pedicure chairs. My girls and I love going to another salon where they have 2 pink kid-sized chairs, which they can sit in more comfortably in as they're made for their size. If that happened, we'd be here all the time!",2
4,"Nice Steakhouse in St. Louis. We went here for a client dinner and was pleasantly surprised. You get a nice view of the arch on the way in to the restaurant as well. The Apps were OK. We ended up getting the Carmine's trio (crab cakes, scallops and toasted ravioli). Crab cakes were above average. The scallops were a little saccharine for my tastes but the ravioli was good; and let's face it...one doesn't come to St. Louis for the scallops. Thankfully the filet mignon was exceptional. It was the perfect size, not too salty and rare just like I had requested. This was partnered with an above average wine list to make a great night out.",2
5,"My wife and I really like this place. Today was the first time we have eaten their, it won't be the last. We got the #49 which was a 3 meat dish with rice. It's made for 2 people and we had leftovers to bring home. The food was very good. The 3 meats were all cooked just right. Everything had a great taste as well. Their is a spice on the table to use on anything you wish. It was also enjoyable. The bottle of wine we got was very good and priced very fairly. The waitress was attentive and the rest of the employees were all nice people. The inside of the restaurant is clean and pleasant. We thought it inviting. We also had Turkish coffee and ice cream after dinner that was a nice end to a enjoyable dinner.",2
5,"I needed a quick eyebrow waxing and was skeptical of where to go. My eyebrows are thin already and I didn't want someone to ruin them. I walked into European Wax Center and got my eyebrows perfectly shaped, in under 5 minutes, for $10. It was honestly faster than getting in and out of line at Starbucks! I will definitely come here in the future.",2
5,"Delicious! Short wait, but the food was more than worth it. Good decor, nice staff, all together a great experience.",2
5,"Roxanne was terrific - a full leg wax while my hair was color processing. I love the convenience of Alston being the ""salon-within-a-salon"" (Walter Claudio). It makes it very easy to multi-task your treatments.",2
4,"I live down the street from the M.L. Rose's 8th Ave. location, so I haven't had a need to drive over to this location. But I'm glad I did! The vibe -- especially the outdoor seating areas -- are great and fit the surrounding area.I ordered the Five Alarm burger, my M.L. Rose go to. I ordered the burger medium well, and it was served medium well -- a feat that seems to becoming less common. The spicy jalapeños and habanero jack cheese provided the classic kick that makes this burger so great in my books. The accompanying sweet potato waffle fries were delicious as always.I'll still default to the 8th Ave. location, but this is a fine substitute if I'm ever in west Nashville.",2
4,"Our second time to Cafe Fleur De Lis!We went to their other location a couple days ago.  The food was so good (had the shrimp n grits) that we had to come back for more!The prices were reasonable for what you get.  The quality of food were good with service to match.  I loved their shrimp and grits, but this time I had to try their Seafood Benedict (Seafood cakes made of crawfish and crab mixture).  It comes with a choice of hash brown (has a slight little kick) or grits.  My friends had the traditional breakfast of eggs Benedict and vegetable omelette. The coffee was good,  and so was the mocha coffee ( piled high whipped cream with drizzled chocolate on top). Overall, our second dining experience was great.This is a little hidden ""Foodie Find"" and gem of a place.  You won't be disappointed.",2
5,"So glad there is a Zupas in the downtown area! Great selections of sandwiches, soups, salads, and protein bowls. Every time I go, I always have a hard time deciding what to order. Pictures below are the chipotle turkey sandwich and Mexicali protein bowl. Delicious. I'd recommend to the management to offer 1-2 more vegetarian salads. Love the chocolate covered strawberry with the combo! Sweet treat",2
5,"I absolutely love this place. The food is superb, the wine is great, the atmosphere is cozy, but still feels trendy. I've been here several times now and each time we closed the place down. It's just a great place to sit, enjoy your meal and have a long conversation with your friends. One of my favorite dishes is the skirt steak ($17). It's a tasty, perfectly seasoned cut of meat. Just the right amount of salt and fat and lime on it. I tried the chicken empanada and the mushroom one and by far liked the chicken one better. I've also enjoyed the paella with shrimp, which I had during Devour Indy. My only complaint was that the serving was a little small for me, and I was still hungry afterwards, but the delicious chocolate flan and the churros that followed that meal remedied that problem. I would recommend this place to anyone, whether it's for a business meeting or an evening out with friends.",2
1,"Okay I JUST got here and am extremely unimpressed. As I type this I'm sitting in the lobby waiting for our room to be cleaned because it wasn't ready for check in time. Our check in time was 3 o'clock (which is already late as it is), and when we got to our room, the place was AN ABSOLUTE MESS. The bedsheets and pillows were thrown on the floor, there were beach towels (not belonging to the hotel) lying around, and KFC food on the table. It was as if someone had just left. Aside from that, the people at the front desk could really care less. When we went up to go talk to them, they didn't even apologize. All they said was to wait HALF AN HOUR for the room to be cleaned. AND they offered us another room... A smaller one. For the same ridiculously priced rate.Primarily upset with the lack of hospitality, not so much for the clean room. People make mistakes, which is understandable. But the way they handled the situation was terrible and I'm definitely not coming back here. **update it's been over thirty minutes and I'm still waiting for a room.",0
1,"Arrived here early for our ghost tour, hoping to catch a bite to eat and a couple brews but was totally ignored by the bartender. So we ate elsewhere then returned. Took advantage of the ghost tour's 2 for 1 Hurricane special. $12 for the most disgusting sugar powdered alcoholic beverages I've ever tried. Ended up throwing them away and getting a couple beers. I would not seek this place out if it weren't for the ghost tour, which was great btw.",0
5,The price was as advertised. The service was top notch and the room was better than expected. Located right next to Bourbon Street and the Absinthe house. I will definitely stay here again.,2
2,"Not a great first experience at Pastorcito. I had three tacos - two pastor and one asada, they were all very underwhelming. The pastor was bland and there was very little meat in the filling, it was mainly made up of fat. The asada was a bit better in that it wasn't just fat. But it still lacked flavor. The saving grace of this place was its salsa. The red one was petty good and if you drench your tacos it's hard to taste the crapiness underneath.Tacos were 1.85, which puts is a bit more than anyone should pay for below average tacos. You can find much better tacos for 1.50 or less at many other places.",0
1,What a disappointment. Not what most expect with jazz bar/dining establishment. Not dark or comfy seating. I got a mojito and I do not think they could spare the mint. They had a sign about a cover charge at 8. They came over and said if we were still there at 8 eating we would be charged. The food was nothing special. It was about equal with Zattarans box foods. The shrimp they served in the jambalaya and gumbo could not be smaller. Service was lacking. They may want to look at improving the food and entertainment to fill their very empty establishment before they focus on a cover charge. To add the music was not worth the five and was not really jazz bar type. The bar was also cheaply done. If they do not change they will be gone in six months.  Hmmm trying to find a positive kids menu was decently priced.,0
5,Very good pizza wife and I loved it so did my picky ass kids definitely will be back.,2
5,Worth it we have been going to the Crabby Bills Group for over 30 years! And its still pretty damn good!,2
4,"We loved this place. The wine flights are a great way for hubby to sample wines unfamiliar to him and for me to graze through some deliciously made cheeses.The atmosphere is upscale yet cozy and the servers are professional, friendly and on time.",2
4,Firehouse is one of my go to places. This new location  is right near my house. The staff here is friendly and doesn't rush you even if they are busy. I like all of their toasty subs so I can't recommend just one. If you're tired of the boring subs from from Subway you should give Firehouse a try. You will love it and this new location.,2
5,"Great place. Came here after Christmas parade, very busy, did a good job keeping up with the rush of people. Food was great. Salsa should be sold on stores. Will be back.",2
1,The margarita tasted like lemonade. It was AWFUL and tasted like it had no tequila in it at all. I asked to either switch it out for something else or for them to remake it and they wouldn't do either. I won't ever be back! Terrible service.,0
4,We dropped in because the wait was too long at another spot and our party of 5 were all very satisfied!Gumbo was bomb Seafood platter can be shared Crawfish etouffe(sp) was better than the shrimpSkip the soft shelled crab....DON'T MISS THE PRALINES! Grab the rum.,2
5,"This place was frickin' amazing! Some of the best, if not THE BEST mexican food I've ever had, and I've had a lot of mexican food. First off, the service was very polite and helpful, recommending some excellent dishes.  I had the tortilla soup, which had everything under the sun: tortilla strips, avocado chunks, sour cream, cheese globs, other good stuff that I don't even know about.  My brother got the cheese soup, which was really good also.I also had a shrimp quesadilla, which was really delicious, due to the spices they put on the shrimp,  nice blend of pepper and other unknown spices.  But the cous de gras, was the chiles, stuffed with shrimp, wrapped in bacon, and sitting in a soy sauce-esque liquid.  UNBELIEVABLE! I have no idea what it was called, but it's an appetizer, just ask the server.I would go far out of my way to make a trip back to El Merendero, I suggest you do the same.",2
5,"Delicious food, quick, efficient and great service. The owner is really nice and always helpful. A must try.",2
5,"Buying a car at Thoroughbred was the easiest experience I've ever had at a dealership, and I've bought and leased cars all over the country.  Michelle Lipinski and Rod Gillis made this transaction as simple as it possibly could have been.  I found Michelle through TrueCar, and she offered a discount even deeper than what TrueCar told me Thoroughbred would give me.  I'm still astounded by how easy it was to get a price that was way cheaper than what I expected.  The whole thing took less than an hour.Seriously, I don't have a single complaint.  If you want a completely hassle-free experience AND the best price you'll find anywhere, email Michele.  She's the only person I ever want to buy a car from, for the rest of my life!",2
5,This restaurant is always amazing!! The atmosphere is so great. Always get refilled on chips and salsa unlike other restaurants. Staff always dressed to the nines. Food is great too,2
2,"Have had better Gyros before. My wife tried the Doner plate, it came with a nice salad,4 different sauces, fresh fries (which for me were the highlight of the meal), some lamb meat and 2 breads. I tried the Doner Berlin which had almost the same contents (except the fries) stuffed inside a Pita-like bread. Pretty simple. Nothing to really brag about.We went on a sunday evening around 6:30 pm and we were the only ones there.Plenty of street parking available within a blocks range.Staff were friendly but that doesn't compensate for the taste.Didn't really live up to my expectations I must say. (Maybe I had high expectations to begin with).",0
5,"This place might be small and tucked into a small strip mall, but it's got great customer service and food so far. The guy that has always been working there is always nice about answering questions regarding the cuisine here. My husband knew he loved Vietnamese food, I however assume it would be full of fish based dishes or stuff a picky water wouldn't like. I could not have been more wrong! oh how I love the pho soup here with beef. I like that with the mint and hot sauce so that I can taylor my flavor. The sweetened iced coffee is yummy and so are  the fried bananas! My mom and my husband love those fresh spring rolls. They smelled amazing! But I don't eat cold food, so that is only second hand! But she said they were the best she's eaten in Indiana ever! We finally got to try one of the dumplings that are normally special order only, it was so savory and tasty! If you are ever there and see them, try them! If you aren't sure you will like something ask what is in it! They are more than helpful.",2
4,"I was on my way to Pho & Beyond with my mom when I was like, ""Hey do you want to try 'La Fusion' instead?"" So we gave it a shot. I gave it a 4 star for one reason: Crispy Duck. It was phenomenal. I asked for both sauces (thai curry / raspberry sauce) on the side - I definitely prefer the thai curry sauce while my mom mixed both sauces together. The duck was seriously cooked to perfection. We also had the shrimp pad thai - it was okay - it wasn't great but it wasn't bad. It's pad thai  - I think the $18 price is a bit much for pad thai. The decor is really nice inside and the server was pleasant. I saw on the outside that there was a 2 course special - but the server never explained it to us or brought it up as an option.  It's all good though. Cons: I think it's a bit overpriced given it's location. If we were in the city it would make sense, but not at Willow Grove. Lack of parking - maybe like 6 or 7 spots? We parked at the Pho & beyond shopping complex - and walked over. I think they should add another door near the back of their restaurant (just a suggestion).  If they have a deal with the bank to park there...they should have a clear, huge sign that parking is allowed at the bank after a certain time. I don't know if it is lack of parking, the weekday, or the $$$, but it was really empty inside the restaurant at 7 p.m. on a Wednesday night. It was a bit awkward. The Olive Garden across the street was overflowing with people waiting outside. It was just awkward. Maybe they should have a groupon deal or something so more people can come to this place. Would I go back again? I think for the Crispy Duck - yes.[Edit]: I received a message from a fellow yelper that on the Saturday they went, there was a 30-45 minute wait. Since I loved the Crispy Duck so much I've decided to have my birthday dinner there. Will keep you posted.",2
4,"Nice pub! First of all the sliders are amazing!! We also had nachos and it was a lot of food for two.  It was enough for four but it was so good!! We had lunch on a Saturday and I can imagine that Friday and Saturday nights are pretty busy, they have room for music and a great bar.",2
5,"We recently checked out GM Bistro off La Canada and Lambert, and it was cramped, noisy and the food was average, only so-so.  What a pleasant surprise to find Chopstix and have a really superior experience!  I'm very strictly gluten-free, and they have a real gluten-free menu with about 6 pages, not just a handful of choices.  My husband ordered the orange chicken, the same meal as he had at GM for a true comparison, and raved about how much better it was at Chopstix. I had a lettuce wrap appetizer - almost $2 off during happy hour - consisting of a large mound of various chopped items and about half a head of iceberg lettuce that was basically a full meal in itself, and was incredibly tasty!  I loved it so much I ordered a second one, had about 4-5 more wraps out of it, then had to have them box up the rest.  I hated to have to stop eating, it was so good but I was so full!  I have a medical situation where I have to eat quite a large quantity of food for dinner, and I can't remember ever having an appetizer that was big enough for an entire meal for me - and most of the time, it's rare that I can even eat any appetizers anywhere because of the gluten in them.So the service was excellent, the food was **outstanding**, and I had a lovely conversation with the manager, whose last day it was.  He has worked with the Southern Arizona Celiac Association, so the employees at Chopstix are extremely well-educated re gluten issues there, which is great because I got glutened just a few doors down from them last week at Native New Yorker, due to poor education on gluten cross-contamination (they served me wings that had been fried in the same oil as stuff with breading.)If I could give more than 5 stars, I would.  This is definitely a restaurant that is getting put high on our list of ones to frequent often!",2
1,"The hotel room service is terrible cause they skimp on shampoos, conditioners,body lotions,tissue and on the toilet paper .You would think they want to keep the customers happy,well they're very cheap on everything. My sheets and towels are often stained. I booked the hotel for the week, and spending the alot of money on my vacation this will never be the hotel I'll ever stay at.Thats a feed back toward better service for the future customers!",0
5,Oh..my...goodness.Recipe for a great dinner: A perfect evening to sit outside + good friend to catch up on gossip + solid beer menu + tasty pizza + small plates galore + NUTELLA GELATO. I left one happy smiling piggie. Service was friendly but respectful of our need for space to enjoy our meal. Would definitely recommend this spot. Next time I'm going to walk there with my pup and enjoy pizza in the puppy area!,2
4,"By fluke I had lunch at Lit Italian Wine Bar. First, I love this downtown area. There are some many shops to peruse and such a great outdoor cafe scene!My diet these days is pretty strict. Gluten free-vegetarian you would think makes dining out difficult. Surprisingly not the case. I am discovering that most restaurants now have gluten free options.Sine it was lunch time, and the sun was out shining, and there happen to be a table available outside, my lunch date and I opted for salads!I had the caprese salad and my date had the ahi tuna salad. The caprese salad had a beautiful blend of juicy red and yellow tomatoes with fresh basil and bococcini and the most flavourful olive oil I had ever tasted! It was the perfect size and was so satisfying!The tuna salad had beautiful lightly seared tuna medallions with greens and raspberries. We were also given complimentary popcorn too!They do have gluten free pasta as an option for their pasta dishes.The place is small yet perfectly laid out and situated downtown. The service was pleasant and quick and the price was RIGHT! I would definitely go again and recommend this place for a nice outdoor lunch, after work wine, or weekend relaxing!",2
4,"Great coffee, great donuts, great place. There was a line the whole time we were there which is a good sign.",2
3,"Ahh, my not so secret  love affair with cupcakes deepens with my experience at Jimmies Cupcake truck. Stopping at one? I would LOVE to see you try my darling. The day I came upon this truck I was all about some cupcakes and they had a pretty amazing variety. I was torn but not for long. I started at their James Bond (red velvet) cupcake and was immersed in a moist and creamy cupcake heaven. Just the right amount of sweetness for the frosting and the cupcakes were not too dense and not too light. It was perfection. I took out the cookies and cream cupcake next. The little Oreo cookies in the cupcake batter...genius. The frosting tasted JUST like Oreo filling and I was taken back to my childhood. I finished off with a menue special - apple cake cupcake. It was buttery, cinnomon-y (what?) and all the things that taste like Fall. Hallelujah! My only regret that day was that I could not eat any more.",1
1,"Pros: - Convenient for when you're looking to feed an overworked sleep-deprived film crew at 6AM on a Sunday on a tight budgetCons:- Food is so bad that even overworked sleep-deprived film crew would rather starve - Eggs tasted like paper, toast tasted like cardboard, potatoes felt like decomposing fruits (not that I would know)I cannot understand how they can mess up the most basic sides.. but hey, I guess they're not exactly known for their eggs, toast, and potatoesPaying a bit more for Dunkin' Donuts sandwiches/croissants is much more worth it.",0
5,This is by far my favorite Chinese place to eat. And my 5 year old LOVES their sweet and sour chicken with lomein noodles.,2
4,"This place was dead as a doornail for midweek lunch, and it shouldn't be.  It's sheik, trendy, has tv's, a bar, and my waitress was very nice.  I had the steak sandwich with sauteed vegetables, and the vegetables were probably the best I've had in Nashville.  The $8 sandwich was awesome, too.",2
2,Not that great. We went for breakfast. The drinks were fantastic but the food....not so much. Everything we have had in new Orleans has been fantastic up until this place. Don't go here.  There are so many othet better places.,0
1,"So here recently the staff has apparently decided to just close up shop whenever they feel like it regardless of posted business hours, sometimes 7:30, sometimes sooner.  Makes you wonder if the owner or franchisee knows that.   The place improved for awhile and now it appears to be headed down hill again",0
1,"I had the worst duck that I have ever had.  It was so tough that I could hardly cut into it.  The cherry sauce was uninspiring at best.  My wife had a curried sole, in which the turmeric was overwhelming.  The only creditable thing was that they agreed to take the duck off my bill.",0
1,"The steak is okay. I give it a 1 because it's not worth the price. Very expensive. You can find a much better steak at other restaurants in town. Plus, my experience was dampened by some annoying couple trying to sell me real estate as I ate at the bar.",0
5,"Home Wine Kitchen is hands down one of the best restaurants in St. Louis, and its ""No-Menu Monday"" is a must try!After giving our sever some insight on our food preferences, my boyfriend and I were presented with dishes that were SPOT ON to our tastes.  The food was absolutely amazing, and the restaurant was super accomodating to my stricter-than-usual dietary preferences (vegan).  Actually, they gave me the best vegan meal I have had in STL to date; my boyfriend was also super satisfied with his meatier fare.  Thank you, Home Wine Kitchen; we will be back!  (Note:  Make sure to make a reservation!)",2
1,This place is terrible. They wouldn't serve me because of the color of my skin. We ended up waiting for our shitball ass food for 2 hours and one 8 oz drink took us 45 minutes. Very polite and courteous waiter though,0
1,"Heard about the history of Dirty Frank's bar, thought it'd be cool to check it out, walked in and met what was a heinous bitch! Can't miss this old bartender, she has long stringy gray/blonde hair, full of tattoos and apparently liked some lumberjack looking man in the corner that day. She paid absolutely no attention to us and was full of attitude from the moment we sat down.Unless you were this tree trimmer you received the bare minimum amount of service. She was offended having to get you a drink because she had to walk away from the brawny man. If this was my bar she would be on the spot FIRED!!! This is supposed to be a historical bar and original speakeasy which could get a lot more business if this troll wasn't manning the place. It says a lot that on a Friday there were only three patrons when we walked in. I am tempted to paint over the murals of Frank Sinatra, Pope Francis even the frankfurter. This place is an embarrassment to all people named Frank and don't get me started on Frank Rizzo...",0
4,Fresh....Greek. Authentic.  There's a reason this place is number one in Tarpon Springs just watch out for dropping olives into the liquid... You willsplash your shirt!  Isn't  that the sign of a good meal is that you wear it on the front of you?,2
4,"LOVE the building itself and all the fab art on the walls. One of the things that makes Eagle unique. Very fun place to grab coffee with a friend! I pass on the food though, because its really not great.",2
5,"Great breakfast spot, bisquits & gravy are great.  Friendly service, daily specials.  Good fir lunch too. Located in quaint fowntown Safety Harbor. Ask for Judy, outdoor desting, doggie friendly, they have goidies for doggy too.",2
2,"We just happened to drive by and saw this place so we decided to stop for lunch. Once we sat down I realized this is not a place for families because it was filled with men. I soon realized the over population of male customers was because of the attractive, all female servers. The menu looked good and they had a kids menu so we decided to stay. We ordered the pretzels sticks, chicken bites, yard bird sandwich and lamb burger. Everything tasted ok nothing exceptional. The worst part was the two men sitting next to us who were drunk (literally doing shots) at 1:00pm on a Tuesday. They were older/middle aged, every other word was a swear and they were obnoxious to the servers. That's the sort of clientele this place attracts. The best part was our server though, she was very efficient and nice. Lastly, the bathrooms were disgusting! Mold all over the sink like it has not had a thorough leaning in a loooooong time.",0
5,"This place is great.  I brought by dog there at night during the week.  They were pretty busy but a nurse came out right away to assess my dog.  The nurses and doctors were terrific.  The cost was obviously a little more then my local vet, but being that it is an emergency room, I expected this.  The wait time (about 2 hours total I was there) was reasonable since it is an emergency room and they had some serious cases come in while I was there. ( I did chuckle at one of the other reviews who wouldn't give 5 stars because they waited an hour- its an emergency room!)  I wish my wait in the human emergency room was this short.  Anyway, great overall experience and I would definitely come back if I had to.",2
5,"I love these burgers.  The fries are pretty good, too.  Don't even get me started on the cheese steaks.  Try to go during daylight hours.  The street is a little on the rough side.  Fitting more than one baby in there who needs a high chair is pretty tough.",2
4,"I am a thin-crust kind of gal so this place is perfect. The pizza is fresh and the toppings are really creative. You can really taste the coal fire in the crust, it is perfectly thin and crispy. Also, the night I went, they were passing out ""new"" appetizers. I don't mind serving as a guinea pig as long as the food tastes good. I deducted one star because the place can be a bit cramped.",2
4,"My co-workers and I all had a hard time understanding why this hotel receives such mediocre reviews.  The shuttle came as soon as I called, had much needed A/C and the driver chatted non-stop with the other passengers the whole trip about Colorado and snowboarding of which I know nothing.  But that just gave me the advantage when I leapt from the bus and made it to the counter first.  This is another Hilton with online check-in which works quite well.  They found my key waiting and handed it to me, so I was literally only about 3 minutes from the shuttle to the room.  As mentioned in my review of the Bay Café, they have a Happy Hour they call a ""Manager's Reception"" in the 2nd floor restaurant which features a roomy deck you can see through the glass doors and many windows that line the west-facing wall.  The snacks they offer change daily and the day I visited they had out dressings, hummus, fresh raw vegetables, potato chips and goldfish crackers.  But you can disguise these meager offerings as a meal with disproportionate amounts of alcohol to supplement.  The breakfast they offer in the same dining room is leaps and bounds better.  One wall has toast, milk, cereal, coffee and pastries.  The other side of the room is a kitchen that has free made to order omelets (only as flavorful as you pile on the calories), scrambled eggs, sausages, biscuits, gravy and hot cereal.  I can only down a plateful but think of how much you'd normally spend for breakfast in an on-site restaurant hotel.  The rooms are standard, with nothing that stands out from other Hilton locations.  One co-worker had a few of the skyline while my room looked out at the city.  It's right across from the Westshore Mall if you're looking for something to do but Florida cities seem much more driveable than other East Coast cities, so most visitors probably have a car to ferry themselves to anything else Tampa has to offer.",2

1,"I thought this was a great addition to downtown St. Pete and was thrilled to have a local place with an extensive selection of spices being that I am a cook. However, the owners are gay hating bigots! This isn't a review on the shop or the product, but a review to let the LGBT community to stay away! I have shopped a few times and each time have been treated differently than the straight people shopping in the shop. The only reason I returned was to make sure my feeling was right. The male owner each time refuses to come from behind the counter to assist me. Its as if he fears he'll catch some disease by talking to a homosexual. Furthermore, I have been there with straight friends and each time have been ignored even though I am the one who need assistance in locating a certain spice. The one time his wife was around she intentionally (and randomly I might add) brought up a conversation about Chick-fil-a and MItt Romney. Again, this isn't a negative review on the shop and its contents but on the owners who cannot refrain from hiding their hatred towards a large part of the Tampa Bay community.  For those wanting to support an anti-hateful local business there are plenty on central and if you need gourmet spices visit The Fresh Market, Rollin' Oats or Earth Organics.",0

5,"Here during MLK weekend 2015.  Clean room, good location, free wifi, comfy bed, and a quick breakfast is what you should expect.   Staff members are friendly.  Rooms are very nice.  Be sure to walk to the beach, marina, or state st.  Parking is convenient. We borrowed a pack and play for our son during our stay.  Very convenient!   I would recommend they provide a flat sheet for the bottom to be folded around it.  We brought our own sheet but it would be nice if there were already one on it.  Will definitely be back.  Thanks so much!",2
4,"Came here from out of town for a graduation dinner and the staff was very accommodating to hold a cake in the back for us to surprise the graduate which was very nice. There was a group of 10-15 of us and the restaurant was spaced out well to where we did not feel crowded. We started off with the chicken 65, veg pakora, and shrimp Manchurian. All came out with good timing, hot, and fresh. The chicken was quite juicy and had the right amount of heat, the shrimp were plump and buttery, and the veg pakora were crispy and did not have that super oily taste that they sometimes can have. We ordered the lamb tikka masala and the tandoori chicken for our entree and I will have to say the lamb melted in our mouth. There was no gamey taste yet it definitely still had a nice lamb flavor to it which was accompanied well by the gravy. The tandoori chicken was good but I would not say anything special- it was lacking in the umami department although it was a nice pieces of meat. We ordered everything medium and it had the perfect amount of heat ( I would say we like heat but not anything that is going to make us sweat). I probably wouldn't visit here again since I am coming in from out of town but if I lived near by I am sure it would be one of my indian food take out spots.",2
4,"If a very loud dining room bothers you, stop here. I will return but with ear plugs. The place is stunning, the service is impeccable and the food is some of the best ever. Hub had ""bayoubaisse "" their take on the French classic. I had the drum with crawfish relish which was large enough to feed two people easily. We shared the bread pudding. We both thoroughly enjoyed our well-prepared beautifully-presented meals. For me , though, that noise level, which was the same in all dining areas was exhausting. My husband was able to tune most of it out.",2
5,"This is a great place to stay. I picked it because of the full kitchen, it was very helpful. We didn't spend as much money on food. Its very clean and cute!",2
4,"Axis Pizza is very convenient- its 24 hrs and within walking distance of two universities. With that being said, it still manages to produce meals that are surprisingly quality. This place boasts about using fresh ingredients, and you'll see what they mean after your first bite. The food is simple, good, and fairly priced. Its my go to for late night meals and it hardly let's me down!",2
5,"I mean, it's a chain, so it's not particularly exciting to write about. But I was in need of a new battery, and they showed me my options and were honest about what was a good deal. Then, they installed it quickly and disposed of the old one. It was quick and hassle-free which I appreciated. Also, the cashier and the guy who put in the battery were very friendly.",2
4,Great pizza! The place is beautiful and the atmosphere is truly inviting. The service is very nice and fast.,2
4,"I travel to Boise at least once a month, if not more.The fact that you have to hit the counter instead of walking out and popping into a car is kind of annoying, but not too terribly out of the way (bottom of the escalators on the way outside)Staff has been friendly and helpful to me on each occasion. Once i had to grab the car instead of a co-worker due to a delayed flight, they were able to switch the reservation etc. with no problem.The signing of the no damage slip is only if you have not reserved on line or ahead of time, and it was indicated to me that i could circle any issues and tell the staff at the booth before i left. Definitely weird, but it all worked out for me, so far.Drop off has always been a breeze, but i head out around noon and always bring the workers a treat! (i have to stop at taco time for the hubby and that location always gives me cinnamon chips - so i leave it for the little fellas that have to be out in the cold collecting my car, it's the least i can do!)It is a small operation at a small airport, and i think they do ok in my book!",2
4,"I love this place! It's an adorable little coffee shop on third street in Old City. It's a small but fairly well designed space with plenty of seating and room for people. The seating area has all your typical coffee house style seats such has tables, bars, and reading chairs. They have all your typical coffee house fair as well; bagels and sandwiches. I have been here quite a few times and it's all pretty good. Very friendly staff as well.",2
3,"Just your typical place where all the clubs get there ""free food offered"" from haha",1
4,Good sushi at a good price as long as you stay away from the specialty rolls. Nice atmosphere. I'll be going back next time I'm in town.  The interior is nicely decorated. The warm wet nice smelling towel before the meal to rinse your hands and the comp vanilla ice cream at the end is a nice touch.,2
2,"I Really really absolutely wanted to like this place. Maybe the kitchen was having a bad night? It was our First try so went with the basics: chicken quesadilla appetizer, Bacon Cheeseburger and Waffle Fries. Quesadilla had no flavor.The burger was way over cooked, dry and flavorless. So sad.  Husbands ""Smashy"" burger was overcooked too.The Waffle Fries were OK. Service was good, it was not busy at 7pm on a Saturday probably due to the rain.A burger and beer joint with so so burgersI really wanted to like it",0
4,Dinner was pretty good. Fish was cooked perfectly. Charbroiled oysters could have been cooked longer. Shrimp and crab pasta was good. Burger wasn't good.. flavorless and over cooked. But our server Devin was outstanding! Felt like he was part of our group!,2
5,"Short Take: Been doing business with Maple for several years. Highly recommended as service and work are exemplary!Detailed Review: Updating after another positive experience at Maple Collision. It may seem odd to say that it's pleasant visiting a collision repair shop, but I know from experience that when they repair a vehicle it will look and function as good or better than before the incident occurred. That's very reassuring.I have had the pleasure of speaking with Pete (the shop's owner), Ed, and Kathleen multiple times both on the phone and in person. I have spoken to on the phone, but have not yet met, Karen and Kevin, also multiple times. Everyone I have dealt with has been very professional, pleasant, and knowledgeable. Pete is very detail oriented and this shows in the way he runs the business as well as the finished product.At Maple, everything is very upfront. The work required is explained in detail, and any questions are happily answered. During the repair process, communication is great, and the work is completed quickly. As for price, I shopped around quite a bit prior to my first visit, and found that Maple's pricing was right in line with what other shops in the area were charging. (I no longer shop around, as Maple's expertise and customer service keep me coming back.) When the work is done, everything is again explained in detail and questions are welcome.This is the only body shop I'll go to or recommend to family/friends, whether the job is big or small and whether going through insurance or paying out of pocket.Edit: Whenever I have taken a vehicle to Maple Collision, I've received a thank you note in the mail afterwards. Nice touch! See pics for most recent note. (First name scrambled by me for online posting.)",2
2,"Me: ""Hi! Which of your smoothies are made with fresh fruit?""Woman behind counter: ""Oh, the pineapple and peach.""Me: ""Great! I love fresh pineapple.""Woman: ""Well, it's canned fresh fruit.""Me:  . . . (Thinking: What are your other fruit flavors made from if not canned fruit?) Our bubble tea (I ordered almond milk tea with boba) comes out, and the almond flavor is waaaay too strong.  I end up throwing it away.Fox News is playing (LOUDLY) on the TV in the corner.I was really excited about this place, because I'm a bubble tea addict and the new location is close to my house! Visions of nightly mango milk teas danced in my head...only to be dashed.  Bings, I'd love it if you could have real fruit in your smoothies, and let's try some music instead of Fox News.  Make some changes, and I'd love to try again!Response to the Comment Below: It's great to know there is real (even if canned) fruit in other smoothies--I'd love to know which ones, because all I had to go off of was what the woman behind the counter told me, and those were the only two she mentioned.  It's too bad the owner asked me not to try again instead of clarifying, because I love to give places another try and update reviews...guess I'll just keep dreaming of Joy Yee's coming to Tucson...",0
1,"Came for all-you-can-eat, and ended up waiting for over half an hour to get our order in. The servers completely ignored us, while taking orders from the tables around us. And on top of that, all of the rolls contain ""extras"" not listed on the menu. One roll surprised us by having sweet mustard sauce on it, which did NOT taste very good....On the bright side, once we actually got our orders in they didn't take all that long to make them.",0
3,"3.5 stars total. If you're used to Philly brunch this is not going to be entirely comparable.  However,  other than diners this is a great breakfast choice in the area. You may need to wait 10-15 minutes for a table on Saturday and Sunday.  There is outdoor seating available for when the weather is nice. The coffee menu is amazing.  This is the only restaurant that I know of (other than coffee houses) that brings a French press to your table.  Variety of beans including Costa Rican,  Hawaiian,  and Jamaican.  Gourmet iced coffee with coffee iced cubes- hell yes! Plus refills free to go. The menu is simple focusing on eggs, hot cakes,  and sandwiches.  Nothing has totally blown me away but the food is good and fresh. Random sidenote obsessed with the red pepper soup.Definitely one of my to go to breakfast spots in south Jersey - recommend.",1
3,"I had been debating on reviewing ML Rose.  But here we go.  I eat here at least once a week.  As with most places when it first opened it was awesome.  Great service and solid food.   Today, it's meehh, OK.   The servers seem entitled, and they are going out of their way to serve you.  I don't understand shitty service.  The food has been luke warm at best when we have gotten it the last 5 trips. Luke warm fries, and cold burgers.  Not exactly worth the 45.00 tab for two burger, fries and two beers.   They have scaled the menu back to the point it's only burgers and cold fries.   If it came out hot and fresh, it'd be the best burger bar in Nashville.   I really keep hoping that the quality will pick up, and I keep coming back.  I think I'll give to two more shots, before I call it off, and just head to 12 South Tap room.",1
5,Great beignets and chicory coffee. This location is closing it's doors after 40 years. This will be my first and last time here. I would have liked to have come back. I think I am now addicted to beignets.,2
5,"Food quality is great, even for lunch time specials (as you know most establishments use specials to use up supplies). The salmon was cooked perfectly. The angus ny steak and filet migon are meat, so cook to your preference. I chose medium well and I got that exactly. Serving size is a bit small, but maybe its because lunch special (so benefit of the doubt). Great place to eat. This place is byob.",2
5,Excellent food and service. The place is functional and funky at the same time. Great choices for breakfast and lunch and a welcoming environment and staff.,2
5,"I went to Audio Itch to get my windows tinted (with warranty) and a front bumper camera with rear mirror display. Their work was reasonably priced, clean, quick, and professional. They have a mini movie theater waiting room with comfortable lounge chairs. I will be taking my cars here from now on.",2
5,Love the interiors. Makes the whole place really interesting! The room was very clean and service was great.,2
5,"I really can't think of anything bad to say about this place! I have eaten there twice and verbally (and loudly) moaned in food pleasure over each meal!Meal One:We Appz'd on the Assorted Breads.  Safe choice, but wonderful selections!My dinner entree was the Amish Chicken. Very tender and juicy and the potato hash was wonderful!Meal Two:The Appz was the Potted Pig, and the Flash Fried Brussels Sprouts.The potted pig was plated creatively having to use a spoon to dive into the pork (texture of a country pate) and then add your toppings from the pickled selections of veggies they gave you either on a cracker or bread.  It was good.... BUTIf you REALLY want a surprising treat, get the Flash Fried Brussels Sprouts! Holy YUM. If Brussels Spouts could ever be considered candy.... you found it here.  They flash fry them and put them in a dish with onions, almonds and bacon! What a TREAT! I chose (after tasting my buddies last visit) the Pork Chop. And I remembered correctly, it was fantastic! The pork was perfectly seasoned and cooked and they put it over a bed of  sweet potatoes and topped it with apple slaw. So many flavors that melded together perfectly! and YES I ate my entire plate!Dessertwe each got one and shared - table of four here-just for reference ;)We got the S'mores pudding. They topped with semi burned marshmallows. Holy yum. and the pudding  was topped with candied pecans.I can not recall the name of the dessert our friends got, but we tried it and it was good as well! I do remember it had cinnamon ice cream.One of the things I like about The Block is you can also purchase fresh butchered meats here!Great place!",2
5,"New favorite spot in stl. Make a reservation and make it early. Place gets crowded. Best burger in stl in my opinion. Share some sides, you won't be mad.",2
1,Don't go here during late night. Fast food resteraunts in the city love to not give a shit at 2:00am and not take your order even though their open 24/hrs. Terrible.,0
5,Coffee and tea done properly. First time here and i was not disapointed. Will be going back.,2
4,"This makes my 6th or 7th time to Jackson's in the last 2 years and I thought that after tonight's visit they deserved a review. I had the panini Reuben.  Panini was amazing. Great use of garlic. Loved the cut of the meat. Not stringy but nicely chinked in thin slices. Cheese was well melted throughout the mix of kraut and meat. Rye Bread was wonderful. Would love to have it as a staple in my house. Salad came out same time as sandwich which was not good.Presentation was a little sloppy. Like every other place I have had a panini (except Panera where they do it right), the sandwich was served directly on a plate. Why don't they serve on a napkin? Particularly when they bring the salad out at the same time as the sandwich?  If the sandwich sits for more than a few moments, the bread gets soggy from the steam.  Nothing serious, but for the price, which is a little high, it seems lacking.  While the price is a little high, i think it is justified considering the food and drink quality. They have a great selection of wines and beers that are likely to fit any palette.  Wait staff have always been friendly. But you can tell this is a place where people are expected to hustle. Sometimes short or even distracted the service can be lacking. The second time I visited was during a medium lunch rush and the wait time was 15 min to get drinks. My trip tonight it was about 8 min. For a sat night this is not bad. But not great either. My bartenders were awesome and never left me wanting (except for getting my salad with the main course).Overall a good experience and I will be back.",2
5,"I had a great experience at the West Beach Inn.  I blindly booked it online because the rate was great and the website mentioned recent renovations.I was immediately pleased upon check-in when we were greeted with wine and cheese in the lobby.  Once we got to the rooms we were even more impressed.  Everything was completely redone - new furniture, fixtures, bed, bathroom, floors, everything was beautiful.  And the beds!! ahh the beds, soooo comfortable.  I got a great night sleep.The hotel is located across the street from a public beach and is walking distance to many restaurants and shops.  I said it many times during my stay and I'll say it again - I'll definitely stay there again when I come back to SB.  I couldn't have been happier with my stay.",2
3,"Coach Andy Reid has to have the worst clock management of any coach. Donovan McNabb is fine but looks like he'll never win the big one. The fans get a bad rap for some incident ages ago when they booed Santa. That aside I like their passion. They care, man!Problem I have is the Iggles never seem to be a super exciting team to watch. Interesting, yes, but not exactly a high-powered offense at the best of times. Did love Harald Carmichael back in the day, though.",1
4,"Can I first confess that while I'm a Top Chef fan, I'm mistakenly thought Kevin Gillespie was Kevin Sbraga? Imagine my surprise when I sat down to my New Year's Eve meal and I saw a brown bear instead of a ginger bear.I've been excited to know a Top Chef winner has opened up a restaurant a few blocks down my place but I haven't gone for months because I felt somewhat intimidated. The price is of course a little higher and I've always had a distaste for restaurant that only offers taste and not fulfillment. So when it was a few days before X'mas and the few restaurant newsletter ever so ""gently"" reminded me that the New Year's Eve dinner is actually a big deal, I started soul searching for a restaurant that I always wanted to try but haven't had a chance to do so, my mind landed on Sbraga.The place has the very same decor that the hipper restaurants in Philly and New York favors, walls lined with wood planks, the very urban wood cabin feel. Silver and black balloons filled up the ceiling for NYE, the place was packed with people. On New Year's Eve, they offered a 4-course champagne menu. While it is nice, it's 3-times more expensive with no selection whatsoever and I'm a light-weight drinker, and it was early and I like to choose, so we opted for the regular four-course menu.I indulged in the rich and surprisingly sweet Foie Gras Soup. It's velvety, almost like a sabayon. For the second course, I had the Sea Bream which I recommend the dish wholeheartedly. The Sea Bream has a really crispy skin, the fish is well cooked. The same can be said about the piece of pork belly in the dish. I also love the squid ink sauce and the calamari ""noodles"". Love it. would eat it again, would even try to make it in my own kitchen. For the third course, I had the fettucine with the perfectly cooked 62 degrees egg. the egg is indeed perfectly cooked, but it's not much different from a pasta carbonara. Maybe even less, since the amount of pasta is little and the dish is recommended to be mixed up, the pasta to egg sauce ratio is a little out of whack. The whole dish is a little more ""decomposed"" than I like it to be. The churro/coffee creme brulee is a nice finish to the meal. I wish that the whole meal is more filling, but at the end it wasn't too bad. Me and my friend was debating whether we wanted a sandwich after the meal, but it was fine. Service was good, our server is charming even though he spilled some water. I had a Sbraga Punch which to me tasted very much like cough syrup and he had no problem switching it to the Bell Hop for me which was quite unique and pleasant. Being sat right next to the kitchen also has its perks, other than being right in Sbraga's face, occasionally you'll hear they yell ""Service!"" which it's almost like they're putting on a show for you before you hear it enough and you wonder whether they are having problems with their wait staff. The couple next to us were obviously not a Top Chef fan, since their waitress told them that she'll ""relay their compliments to Kevin"" and they were murmuring to themselves that they had no idea who Kevin was.Will I go back? I would probably, if a friend hasn't been and suggest to go. Personally, I still like to have a meal that fills me up, especially if I have to pay almost $100 per person.",2
2,"As others are writing, the atmosphere is great.  I'm surprised this has as high a rating as it does.   Probably because many are only drinking.  The service was extremely slow on a pretty empty early evening week night.  (5:30).   Food was mediocre at best.  Several people in our party feels it was all microwaved.  And to have $$ for the menu price is deceiving.  Most everyone in our party thought it was way too pricey.   We are quasi-local and will find another place next time.  Ps.  Waitress was very pleasant.",0
3,"So after I posted the review about the receipt goof  up they did,  the manager reached out to apologize and refunded the money. I'm updating my review to only mention the effort they put in to fix the issue at hand. So hoping they have better practices set to avoid future such incidents.",1
3,"So much to see and do... If you are age 4-11. My daughter is one going on two and can only really play in the infant/toddler area which is fun for her but maybe only for an hour before she gets bored. It annoys me that the parents are forced to pay $21 a piece to sit and watch your child, it's ridiculous honestly. So, to take my parents and myself to watch my daughter play for an hour it cost me almost $70.   Besides them robbing people, I do think the concept is cool for other children who are in the age range mentioned. There are lots of things to explore and play with. Only really skimmed most of the museum the past three times we have gone since my daughter isn't old enough to really play in any of the other areas but I'm sure this will be much more worth while once she's older :)",1
4,Never go during the week.. They like to try out new cooks.   Fri sat sun sooo good :),2
5,"Don't let the generic food-court-style name fool you; there is nothing generic about this Korean outpost of awesomeness in the culinary wasteland of Brentwood. I love the sensation that I'm underpaying for my food, and the chef here whips up Korean dishes of a character and quality that is likely matchless in Tennessee, and they turn around and sell 'em for $10 or less. The Korean tacos are all diabolically good, the fried rice side dish is good enough to be an entree, and the daily specials surely hold the key to paradise. If the great food isn't enough, and it usually is for me, STB has a great community vibe. Many of the customers appear to be on a first-name basis with the folks working here (sadly, my impatience with traffic on Franklin Road means I do not come here often enough to count myself among them), and I am always addressed heartily upon arrival and departure. Without question, this one of Greater Nashville's elite cheap food stops.",2
5,"What a cute, quaint place!  The service was fantastic and the coffee was fantastic.  I went with an iced coffee that tasted very nice and wasn't bitter at all.  Will definitely be back for more!",2
5,Great great oysters. Some of the best I've had in the Tampa/St Pete area. Casual. It's easy to go right by.  Stop if you can. Make sure you tell Carley (bartender) that Bruce Lee says hi!!!,2
4,Went there for their anniversary event. They have a pool table and some arcade games. All their beers are on tap and for sale. Great place to hang out. Tours of the brewing area are also available,2
4,Love this place.  I always come here for quick delicious donuts.  Chocolate cake with chocolate frosting is delicious.  The place itself is TINY though.However I am not giving this place 5 stars because last saturday night I came here around 10pm to grab late night donuts... the lady who waited on us was not friendly at all.  Didn't even say HI or welcome or anything.  Not a fan of that type of customer service.,2
5,"I found this little gem while passing through TN to see family during a move. LOVED IT!! 1. I'm a greater Seattle area girl at heart, so I love finding these little drive-up coffee stands. No matter where I'm at, if I spot one I have to try it out. In Hendersonville you will not find better coffee than this place. 2. Manual machines. If you really appreciate espresso, then you'll appreciate the importance of what a manual espresso machine does for the taste of your drink. 3. Great location. On a main strip, easy to get in and out of.4. Double-sided drive up windows. And no call/order box. The best coffee stands put you face to face with your barista right from the start.5. After coming here twice, the OWNER had me (an out-of-towner) and my drink memorized. If you love GREAT coffee, don't pass this place up.",2
4,Came here for brunch with family and friends and we really enjoyed our meals. I had the chicken and waffles and it was decent. Looks like I missed out and should have order the burger instead because that tasted awesome. Cool atmosphere and nice service. Definitely will return to try their dinner menu!,2
5,"When you combine (Ambiance, Service, & Food) ~ Kimberton Inn has the Best Sunday Brunch in the area!  Reservations are highly recommended! ~CD",2
4,"Yet another fine hipster coffee shop in Reno! I am telling you kids Reno is the new Portland. They have all the choices you would expect from a third wave coffee shop, beautiful fully manual espresso machines that are intregrated into the counter and are droll worthy in their beauty and function. Chemex and V60 for pour over fans and freaks, a selection of teas that is decent and some really gross versions of ""cronuts"". They also have some blends and concoctions that are good for the fans of the sugary bombs of Starbucks and that ilk.The space is pure hipster, simple clean, subway tile and wood, just a handful of tables inside and out and they have free wifi and clean bathrooms. Baristas are way friendlier than the surly folks in SF and the west coast and the prices are cheaper too than in the usual hipster towns.",2
5,"This place is amazing! The food  meets every expectation. The staff is very friendly.  Sandy , our server , treated us like family . This is our go to place !",2
4,"My husband and I were headed to Chili's, when we noticed that Barrel 55 had just opened, so we decided to give the new place a try. The interior of the restaurant has been transformed from a Mexican restaurant. It was well lit, and quite comfortable. We were their first customers of the day, so no waiting, we were shown directly to a table. We couldn't have asked for better service! Every need we had was met almost before we knew we needed it! The menu is a little limited, but we found plenty of dishes that sounded great. We finally settled on the beer cheese fondu and the prime rib sandwich with fries to share between the two of us. The fondu was delicious, served with cubes of bread and roasted Brussel sprouts. The good stout cheese held up to the Brussel sprouts, and was very flavorful. The sandwich was very good, moist flavorful thinly sliced prime rib, covered with caramelized onions and au jus for dipping. I thought the flavor was very good, but the little condiment cup of au jus was way to small to try to dip the sandwich in. We suggested they look at a different container for their au jus. But the fries were wonderful! I don't eat fries often, so I consider them a treat! Barrel 55's fries are real potatoes, well seasoned and cooked just right! My only disappointment was they didn't offer fry sauce to go with them! Our server immediately promised to go make some for me, but alas...the kitchen didn't have any mayo. I'm not sure how they prepare a burger without mayo, but I'm sure I'll find out eventually! I have to say, we definitely enjoyed our meal and will go back for the prime rib sandwich, I loved those caramelized onions! Our iced tea glasses never ran dry, and our server was attentive, but not annoying. I suggest you give Barrel 55 a try, I hope it will be successful and be around for a long time! It is a welcome change from the big chain restaurants.",2
2,"First off all the really good local restaurants are closed on Sunday nights so we ended up in the tourist trap water front area for dinner. Went to Oliver's with a party of 8. We had a variety of entrees from the menu and all I can say is for $40 per person (total bill including the already added 18% gratuity and tax and a $40 bottle of wine) what a disappointment. Took 45 min to get our food, and of the 6 different dishes only 1 had any real flavor (ravioli). If you're looking for bland and slow close to the quarter this is the place to go.",0
4,"At Barnett's, its all about convenience.  I lived behind Barnett's for about a year and a half and it was great having a place to pick up beer and other essentials.  They have a really nice non-alcoholic beverage selection as well as a deli. The staff is also friendly and tend to remember you, especially if you frequent it like I did!! I always felt safe going there, which is important in this area.The hours would be the only thing I would change. They close at 8 p.m. on weekdays and at 4 p.m. on Saturday. Also, they are closed on Sundays which was a bummer. Barnett's is more than A-OK in my book! In fact, I still find myself stopping here when visiting friends in the neighborhood. The convenience got me there but the selection and staff kept me hooked.  I can't quit you Barnett's!!",2
1,"One out of three dishes was good. I ordered what was highlighted on Guy's show. The chargrilled oysters were fine. The pizza and the crawfish beignets looked like they should be amazingly delicious, but that fake white American-tasting cheese ruined it for me. End of story.",0
2,"We went to Germantown Pub for trivia night. So - I'm a bit of a trivia snob. And the trivia at Germantown Pub seems like it might be just getting off its feet, because it was a bit disorganized and a bit slow (but still fun - it's trivia after all)! Now to the Pub! Food was pretty typical bar food options. Beer options are okay, but it doesn't have the great beer options! Service was pretty good.All in all - it was a lot of fun to hang here with friends, but it wasn't a place I'd go back to! Just a typical bar!",0
5,"I wasn't sure what to expect walking up to this place. It is in a strip mall, and they have AstroTurf on the front patio.  My wife is very skeptical of places like this, but she decided to give it a try with me.  We both ordered kebabs one lamb and one chicken.  I lived overseas in college, and would eat authentic kebabs regularly, so I know what to expect.  My wife and I shared our meals and she absolutely fell in love with kebabs! Great place and the owner seemed genuine, I would recommend this place all day long!",2
5,Great gyros and burgers. Probably the best gyro I have ever had in the metro east area. Food is prepared fresh and fast.,2
4,"Great spot for big groups! Order at least $400 dollars worth of food in the large 3rd floor karaoke room and get the room for free (for 3 hours). The karaoke machine is fairly up to date, plus they have the actual music videos. Food is good as well! Went on a Friday from 8-11 for a friend's birthday. We had probably 40 people in the room and we fit pretty comfortably. You have to order for the whole group (and they'll bring out the same dishes to each table) but so much food comes out and it's all pretty good so there shouldn't be an issue where someone has nothing they want to/can eat. The food is pretty standard for Chinatown in terms of taste and options, but if you're not sure what to get some popular dishes are: walnut shrimp, salt baked squid, steamed pot fish, and any veggie dish. Just get whatever you want, it'll all be good.*They're also really nice in dealing with drunken/rowdy groups, so this is where large groups go to get smashed.",2
5,"I always enjoy my treatments and the time I spend at Ame.  I have had both prenatal and regular massage, nail treatments, waxing and facials.  By far, my favorite treatment is the Ame Touch Facial because the products are wonderful, the atmosphere is so relaxing and they massage your hands and feet too!  I can't wait to go back.",2
4,"OK sooooooooooooooooo I'm not a chicken eater; as a result this review will be about the service on the 1st day of opening:Signs provided a countdown to the opening, I found this to be a plus, no need to stalk the building, you know. AnyWHO, on opening day, in the drive thru, I found the cashiers to be efficient, friendly (speaking to my 11month old niece), timely &  swift in their transactions. I placed two separate food orders, one for my granny & my sister. Pricing was fair, you can get a whole meal &  drink for less than $7; one of those 3 chicken fingers deals; that's cool, I've become so accustomed to $10+ for fast food meals until I was pleasantly surprised at this event. The lemonade is very tasty &  since I only got a sip of my sister's, I vowed to return for my own. As stated, the drive thru line moved rather swiftly considering this was the 1st day; I was impressed. Only thing I would've liked to see was the store set a little more off the street because the drive thru line hung out into the street making passing as I exited a very difficult feat. Glad it's here in the area; adds to the community in many ways.",2
3,"I purchased a Groupon for a night stay here in a Jr. Suite & the room was 50% off & ran $200 with the discount.  I was already heading to TN to visit some family so my mom & I decided to use the Groupon the night before I left so we'd be close to the airport.  We had both been to the hotel in the past (prior to the flood) and thought it was so gorgeous & we couldn't wait to actually stay here & see what the room would look like.  According to their website we were in for a real treat in our room but when we arrived that wasn't the case at all.  First off, their parking has gone up & is now $18 per night to park in a lot that doesn't shuttle you & your luggage to the main hotel, you have to walk.  If you choose to valet the cost is $24 per night which I have a huge issue with...the parking is outside in their own lot, this is not a major city like NYC where parking is limited so I feel that charging people to park & walk is a bit ridiculous, I can see charging $5/10 for valet but charging me to park my own car & shlep my own bags is a slap in the face especially considering the room rates.  How are locals supposed to be patrons to the businesses inside if they have to pay that much just to park?  The hotel itself if gorgeous but the room was pretty boring...it was a large single room with a 4 person dining table & 2 armchairs, it was not at all what was explained on their website which indicated ""Our suites include a moderate-size living room and optional connecting bedrooms with endless possibilities for entertaining or for small corporate meetings"".  This led me to believe that we wouldn't be sleeping in the moderate sized living room & have no bedroom at all.  At no time during booking or check in was I asked how many beds I wanted & since I thought our suite had bedroom(s) I didn't ask & when we got to the room we had 1 king.  I called down to the front desk first to ask why we were put in a standard room & why it only had 1 bed & I was told ""our Jr. suite is just 1 large room & you should have specified when asked how many beds you wanted"" I replied ""I was never asked during booking or check in what I wanted"" I was then told ""well, if you want to change to 2 beds I can transfer you to the front desk & you can see if they have anything available"" and I said ""no, I don't want the hassle I guess we can just share the bed"" and was told ""OK, sorry you are disappointed"".  The guest services person didn't offer to find out the 2 bed availability for me, she didn't offer to move us to a garden view room (which is still cheaper at its standard rate than the discounted rate we paid for the suite) or offer any other solutions either & I was really disappointed with that.Once we got over the disappointment of our room we got dressed & hit the hotel to shop, eat, cocktail & check out the murals & water shows.  First off we tried to find the water show & weren't having any luck so we proceeded to shop & asked the woman working in one of the stores where we could find them & she said ""oh, they aren't running tonight"" so that was disappointing but we moved on to exploring the murals when we were then asked by a lovely gentleman to leave because of an event that was going on behind the closed doors of the area we were in.  After a couple hours of being at the hotel we were 0 for 4 so we decided to start drinking...we hit up Fuse & each had 1 drink & our bill was $19 so we moved on to dinner at Jack Daniels which was so good & reasonable priced.  I think our total bill was under $40 & we didn't have any drinks but we did have leftovers!!  After dinner there was nothing left to do so we went back to the room for some shut eye which was great until we got the luxury of listening to our neighbors have sex.  After all of that I took an Ambien & slept really well until about  7 am when I could hear people talking in the hallway & room doors closing one after the other.  My mom said she slept for s**t because of all of the noise & it was a shame too because the bed was so comfortable.  I'm sure that if everything we wanted to see & do would have been available to us this wouldn't have seemed like such a let down & the boring room wouldn't have been that big of a deal but considering that we weren't able to do anything that was on our list I would be hesitant to stay here again unless we had an atrium room so we could at least sit on the balcony & people watch.  Don't get me wrong, the lush greenery & the beautiful architecture as well as the shopping & food are all amazing but as a guest I left feeling pretty let down.",1
4,Good choice of appetizers and entrees. You can choose the level of heat for spicy dishes. Nice quiet venue.,2
5,"Wow, wow....just wow.  So after a year of dying to come here, I finally made it.  My girlfriend treated me for my birthday.  We made reservations for 2 at 6PM on a Wednesday night.  This place is BYOB so bring your wine!  The place is SUPER tiny, so be prepared for that.  This isn't your standard Italian place by any stretch.  There are only roughly 12 tables here, which I'm sure undoubtedly ensures the highest quality food coming out in a timely manner.  The wait staff were pretty darn good.  They worked more as a team as the 3 person squad were all constantly at our table either delivering food or checking up on how we were doing.  We never had to ask for more water and were helpful and choosing a perfect menu for us.We decided to go with 2 orders of the antipasto and an order of the shrimp/beans appetizer.  The antipasto was AMAZING, almost everything on it was unique and flavorful.  My girlfriend was obsessed with the fresh arugula.  I loved the roasted red peppers, frittada and asparagus.  The shrimp were expertly cooked and seasoned and pretty much unlike any shrimp you get at a restaurant.  Well worth it in my opinion.For our entree we decided to get 3 small portions of different pastas on the menu.  We went with the spinach gnocchi, tagliatelli al limone with the bottarga cheese and the pesto trapanese.  All were extremely unique.  I've never had spinach gnocchi quite like this and was such an awesome experience.  The tagliatelli was super fresh and the limone sauce was divine.  I loved the pesto dish and the crushed pistachio on top complimented the pesto so well.They are also pretty liberal with their bread here, so order away!  The tomato pie focaccia was amazing.  The other bread was on par as well.We ended our night with some zeppolies.  They were warm and fresh.  The nutella sauce was a great modern twist.  A perfect ending to a perfect meal.The place can be a bit on the high side, but I think it's totally worth it.  This is coming from someone who would merely be happy with 2 for $20 at Chilis.On an ending note, with the place being so super cramped it can get a wee bit loud.  The table next to us had about 6 people and were dominating the noise space of the entire dining area.  It was quite obnoxious, but it was tolerable...only because of the food!Am I going back? Do you have to ask?",2
4,"Kanella had excellent appetizers!  i would recommend the watermelon salad, the rabbit and duck sausage, the three dips and the boureki!   The decor is nice and it feels truly greek, but the noise levels are pretty high.",2
5,"This is my 5th MB i have purchased and i recently had the greatest experience ever with both the dealership and my sales rep Bret. It was a surprise 25th anniversary present for my wife.

5,"I stayed at the Canary Hotel in Santa Barbara a few months ago and Signature Parking is their valet service.  Unfortunately, after I checked out, I realized my rental car had gotten scratched while at the hotel.  I called Signature and the rental car company and filled out the required forms for each.  I just called the rental company to confirm that the issue was resolved and it has been.  Accidents happen of course, but I really appreciate that Signature took ownership of the issue and resolved it without any hassle or stress on my part.  Believe me, they were WAY easier to deal with than Dollar Rent a Car was, who was next to impossible to even get on the phone!  Thank you Signature.",2
5,Favorite place in Nashville for breakfast!! This is a must go to spot!! Near Vandy and always busy...park in the back lot and be sure to get the parking ticket from the machine so you won't be charged...its free parking for a specified amount of time. My favorite is banana pancakes...think banana bread only in a pancake!! Perfection!!!! I don't leave Nashville until I go here to eat my pancakes!,2

4,"The food was quite good, with the usual assortment of offerings.  We decided to take out -which this place is perfect for.  It is a bit hidden around the back of the shopping center, so it's not obvious to come across. However, this location (& plenty of parking) does make it a much more convenient local option for Indian takeout.  Plus, the prices are better than media too.  BYOB.",2
5,"Love this place! Quick, delicious and service is great. Pho, bahn mis and spring rolls are all perfect! Never miss an opportunity to eat here.",2
1,"Awful! Our fav Chinese restaurant down the street closed their business and we gave this place a try. Very little meat in the 2 dishes we ordered. Very small portions or white rice to pair with the dishes. Crab Rangoon were sad with little filling and over cooked. To top off, they only take cash so I had to leave and make another stop. Will not be back. Plenty of other Chinese American restaurants in town.",0
5,I absolutely love this great spot!  It is so hard to find real healthy food in the area...a lot of other restaurants claim they are healthy but greasy and loaded with garbage.  The staff is pleasant and helpful anytime I have a question about a particular menu item.  Keep up the good work boys!,2
5,This place is so delicious! Get the frozen lemonade. The service is great and it's a wonderful stop to cool down after walking down the French Quarter.,2
4,"The wait is sometimes outrageously long (an hour or longer) and there has been more than one occasion where the hostess forgot to call our group when the table was ready. But after the disappointment of waiting so long and dealing with a terrible hostess, I always leave happy as the food is so good.Get the orange juice everytime",2
5,"Claire does an amazing job!! Thanks so much for an enjoyable time with family, excellent drinks, and incredible food!",2
5,"We eat here almost every week.  The sushi is very good, they offer a selection of some of thee best rolls offered at other places but all in one place and just as good, plus some original to here as well.   Appetizers and desert are included, the staff is fast and friendly, and they offer free beer or sake.",2
1,"Because when I say I want a non smoking room,it doesn't mean put me a a smoking floor in an enclosed hotel in a non smoking room. I don't want to smell that shit EVERYTIME I walk out my door. Won't be back. Thats why I called at 3:00 to make a resi so I could get a good room. But he wouldn't make me a reservation.",0
5,"My husband and I went to Thailand for our honeymoon and we're missing some of that good Thai food -- this place hit the spot PERFECTLY. You get a good amount of food for what you pay, my husband and I ate our fill and both had leftovers for the next day. This place is a hole in the wall kind of place, one of those amazing rare finds. Can't wait to come back and try more!",2
3,"Da Vinci's had a 2/1 prime rib dinner special going and since my husband and I are suckers for food deals, we decided to try it.  In fact, we went there for the same special 3 times.  The food and service was great,  my only criticism is the yorkshire pudding that comes with the prime rib,  to me yorkshire pudding tastes like a greasy pancake and this was no exception. Dinner included soup or salad, we opted for soup was very nice, a butternut squash perfectly seasoned. Seemed like a great deal so we returned a few weeks later.  On our second visit..same food, same great service but upon receiving our check we noticed that we were charged $3 for each bowl of soup. We asked about it and were told that soup is no longer included in the special, not a big deal but it would have been nice to tell us that up front.  Third visit,  we ordered the same thing figuring that  even though the soup portion is small it's worth $3, but when we get our check it is now $6 a bowl.  We asked about it and were told that it's always been $6...Ok, so I guess we were hallucinating when we ""thought"" it was $3 the week prior.  In my opinion, they should have continued offering the special with soup, it just felt cheezy for them to take it out of the special unannounced, and then double the price on a 2 ounce bowl of soup without notice. My only other criticism is that without a discount or 2/1 special the food is overpriced.",1
4,Great happy hour.  And brunch.  Only had dinner there once and it was only OK- probably because I ordered something I don't typically eat.  It'll definitely try it again.,2
5,Double char burger with cheese and onion rings. My to go stop in Goleta,2
4,"We made our way to Surrey's one morning before checking out the WWII D Day museum (just a few blocks apart). They don't take reservations and we did encounter a small line.... We were seated within 10 minutes and everything was great. Their menu was really interesting... lots of different and things. We were disappointed that the juice bar didn't have any oranges to make orange juice for breakfast. I had the Shrimp and Gritts... wife had their Banana's Foster French Toast, neither disappointed. I'll be back to try some of the other things... This really is a great find just outside the French Quarter! Cash only too.. so plan ahead.",2
3,"I ordered delivery from here 3 times when I wanted sushi, all 3 times the delivery guy instead of knocking or ringing the doorbell just...opened my front door, which scared me to death, another time I waited over 2 hours for my food...and old sushi is not good sushi. Maybe its better to sit and eat at, I only used their delivery service and likely won't be doing so again. But generally speaking they are fine.",1
4,"Decent food...great service, but not sure why the reviews are so superlative for this place....dinner is a tad bit expensive and maybe not worth it, but then again better option in the area do not exist.Pros: The apps and the duck dishes.Cons: prices are a tad high for dinner.",2
4,"Cute location, there is a line, but pretty good food. Great location, but I was disappointed that when we arrived about 3:15, after being in line for about 15-20 minutes, we were informed that the ribs are only available at dinner time. Yes I rolled my eyes! But the cashier was very friendly and asked about how our trip was going so we decided to try out the pulled pork sandwich and several of their sides. Great food! Just disappointed I didn't get to try their ribs.",2
3,"Went out for a late dinner in a city we did not know very well, after a few blocks saw this very nice looking restaurant in a area with many bars but weren't in the mood for bar food...meatball app was great so was the gravy that came with it, the caponata was good too and burrata just needed some seasoning.Ordered personal pizzas a margherita and then a clam/bacon but said panchetta on menu they both tastes great hot! But one cooled back at the hotel room tasted bad for some reason.As a side ordered broccoli rabe which cost 6 bucks but the serving size looked like a 3 buck suggestion, the rabe was not bitter at all the freshest i'ver eaten prepared in oil and garlic just a bit too much red pepper flakes...but still damn good",1
2,"Not sure why the reviews are so high for this place.. Great live band, ok food and bad service. Only a few other tables taken but waited 10+ minutes to order drinks. The fish tacos were tasty; pan-seared scallops were over-seasoned and disappointing.",0
5,"The place was glamorous and ritzy. We booked through a third-party, so there was an extra fee for that. The staff member upgraded our room, though was surprised the two rooms we booked were not adjoining. The beds were so soft and I slept well for the first time in weeks. The bathroom was spacious. DO NOT touch the food or mini-fridge spread out on the dresser though. After 45 seconds, they charge your room for the item (even if you do not eat the item). My party did not touch any of the items since we saw previous YELP reviews that warned about it. The restaurants in the place were expensive, but we did go into a cafe at the far end of the casino that was reasonably priced. We had to go through the smoke of the cafe, but it was still a nice place to eat. There didn't seem to be enough elevators to go from the main lobby or casino to the hotel rooms, but walking around was not too bad. They give complimentary wheel chairs to guests who have difficulties walking as well. Overall, nice place and would stay again if I'm in Reno.",2
5,Delicious.. love the variety of toppings!! The Staff was friendly and very quick. The restaurant was very clean and so we're the bathrooms.,2
1,I used to think this place was amazing. During office hours the place is fantastic but grabbing food during a night out? Don't even do it . All the workers assume every patron who comes at night is a drunk. So asking simple questions is automatically a reason to yell and refuse service. Customer Service is absolutely horrible. I WILL NEVER GO HERE AGAIN. there patties have shrunk and price has remained the same. This place has definitely taken a dive from what it used to be.,0
4,"Yo- just order the Grits no matter what time of day you think it is. Historically, most of the time I was too hung over to recall how we got there, but thankful that I had arrived. Guaranteed that by the time I left I was a new person.On a side note, Honey's always seemed to be part of the worlds longest walk of shame.  The only way to improve the place would be to offer a locker room with showering facilities.One time, near Halloween, I want to see Pinback play at the TLA. I had dressed in a full Hooters uniform and received many accolades from my date, other concert attendees and the general public. The next morning we woke up and drove a scooter to Honeys. I sat there, a bit worse for wear, eating the Grits in that uniform and really could have used a shower.",2
4,"Best bloodies in the French Quarter!  Hit this place after grabbing a few beers on Bourbon.  One sip of this bloody and I gave out a big ol' shout!  ""God dayum that's a good bloody!!"".  Then promptly ordered a second.  I'm no foodie, but this was really good and worth a little skirt off Bourbon St.",2
5,"Are you kidding me? This is without a doubt some of the best food I've ever had my life. The bread is the best, and I cannot believe the chocolate croissant. Ambience is wonderful, intriguing, and very chic. People are friendly and kind.  Coffee looks great but I didn't try it (yet! I WILL be back) Prices are good, too.",2
5,"Came here for breakfast for the first time a year ago.  Went here again last week.  Still very good!   Food is delicious, and the coffee (capuccinos, lattes, etc.) are outstanding.  Not too hot, not too bitter, and the milk is incorporated into the coffee just right.   Will definitely come back the next time we visit Santa Barbara.",2
5,Restaurants don't have to have $50 entrees to be great.  This hole in the wall is ran by a nice family and offers 7 different types of BBQ Sauces made in house!  The Maque Choux Mac is one of the best things I've ever had.  For under $15 you can enjoy that with their many times of sandwiches and/or meat selections.,2
5,"We were in Philadelphia for one night and were really craving Spanish food!  We found this place and were immediately excited.  No one was in the restaurant which made us a bit skeptical at first, but later we realized it's because most people get takeout!  This place has so much variety and gives huge portions.  I got a skirt steak with yellow rice and it was fantastic.  My friend got Chicken and Shrimp in a garlic sauce.  We both enjoyed our food very much and it was very reasonably priced.  We ended the meal by sharing a piece of tres leches cake (which was fantastic) and coffee.  The coffee cups were  a little small but it did the trick.This is a great low key place with great food.I will definitely be back when in the area and I would highly recommend!",2
2,"We arrived at the restaurant without reservations. We were seated without a problem. But we had a third with us who was running late. Our waitress did not want to take our appetizer order. She said something to the effect that the chef didn't like to take partial orders and that there was a party going on upstairs (which didn't make any sense to us). She later came back, and in a fake nice way said our table was reserved for later guests. Well, our third party finally arrived, we had our dinner (great food), and by the time we left, there were no fewer than 5 tables available around us. Out waitress's threats were shallow, but made us feel very uncomfortable. Bottom line: good food, arrogant service.",0
5,"Absolutely the very best Pralines I have ever had in my entire life...and I've probably tried them by fifty different makers!These are so rich and creamy that you'll tell yourself you can't possibly eat it all. But you will , you most definitely will! And they're very affordable. I bought three for $7.I can't speak to their other candies as I was faithful to my first love, but that kind of quality is generally across the board.",2
1,"This restaurant is over rated. My family went because we were new to the area and have heard great things. They are very packed, hardly any parking and you always have to make a reservation. I thought I would be happy with the food. However, when we went for dinner the menu had some food that sounded good, but my husband and I struggled to find something that we liked. We did get the California roll and that was good, but we were not impressed with the teriyaki chicken. It seems like our experience is one of the few, but personally we will not be going back again.",0
4,Prices are reasonable.  The owner and the staff is friendly.  The place is clean.  The garlic soy wings and fries are delicious.,2
5,Stopped in for happy hour. The Bloody Mary was perfect and the happy hour food specials were well priced and tasty. The chipotle pizza was excellent as was the service.,2
5,"After spending the better part of a week indulging in gluttony, New Orleans-style, we were looking for something light, fresh, casual, and inexpensive. Our local friend pointed us to Lilly's. She said the woman who used to do here nails at the salon had opened a great Vietnamese restaurant.As soon as we walked in we were greeted by an energetic, friendly woman (Lilly herself?). It was like dining at the home of your favorite aunt; she was pleasantly chatty, enthusiastic, and attentive.We started out with the spring rolls, which were light and refreshing (these are the ones with soft rice paper, not fried). For our main course I had the grilled beef vermicelli and my girlfriend got the shrimp salad. I'm usually skeptical of ordering salads at Asian restaurants because they often seem to be throw-aways designed to make the menu more friendly to a western eye, but this one was delicious. The shrimp were grilled perfectly and it had a great sweet-spicy-smoky dressing (wish I knew what was in it).Attention to detail set Lilly's apart. Lightly fried slivers of garlic, perfectly grilled shrimp, fresh chunks of strawberry in the salad -- all the ingredients were carefully selected and prepared lovingly. For a fresh, casual lunch you couldn't do much better.",2
5,"Lots of improvements to this place. Much more comfortable environment now.  The chairs could be a bit more comfortable as it'd be nice to sit through an entire football game. Otherwise, this place has really improved.",2
5,"Great restaurant and atmosphere!  Had a live band that went on at 8:30 - it was a little loud for my liking but they were really good.  The food was outstanding, for an appetizer we had the fried pickles and fried green beans - the dipping sauce was great as well.  For the entree I had the chicken fried chicken which was without question the best I have had, and I have had a lot of it in Tennessee!  Will definitely come back!",2
5,We have been customers of Bamboo House for over 10 years. This is our go-to Chinese restaurant. The crab Rangoon is the best that I have ever had. Both the chicken and beef with broccoli is our favorite. The sesame chicken and moo sho shrimp are also family favorites. I highly recommend Bamboo House and wish the had a location on the north side of Indianapolis so I could have it more often!,2
5,Lisa and Miles make the perfect dynamic duo! They are both very friendly and professional with the way they conduct business. They are always informed on the latest market trends and offer great advice (especially to first time buyers) like myself :) I would definitely recommend them for all of your real estate needs!,2
4,"Hello again yelpers!I gotta say, this is a pretty solid mexican restaurant. Their food is usually great-tasting and nice and hot and the service is not too bad but could always be better. This review is gonna be a pretty short one though. Whenever I want good mexican food that's nearby then this is the place I'd go, unless, of course, I'm going to another area altogether. I could go ahead and compare this place to other mexican joints, but I think that's kinda like derailing my own review.I'd certainly recommend this place to anyone in the Rivergate/Madison area.",2
1,The food was tasty service not so good two of us got our plates then the third person then finally the fourth person and then after we asked we got our appetizers felt kind of rushed out of there a lot of money not a nice atmosphere,0
4,"OPA! Love love love this little gem of a BYOB in the Fairmount hood. The girls and I walked right in on a Friday night with a few bottles of wine in hand and had a wonderful experience at Zorbas. We shared an array of dishes such as the cold platter stocked with great mix of yummy greek dips ( hummus, feta , tzatzikii etc). It was a hit for sure- just note that it comes with one pita- the dips are very generous and the 5 of us had no problem sharing- we had to request more pita though (which by the way, the pita is perfect). The mussels in a sweet red red wine sauce sans shells were so tasty. The hot feta dip and spring salad were also just as good. We topped the meal off splitting a delicious slice of cake in honor of my friend's birthday. The service was very accomodating and the atmosphere inside is super cozy- nothing fancy,  has an old school Greek feel. All of this for a mere $15/person.  You can't beat it ! I can't wait to head back and try some of the fishes and meats on the menu.",2
5,"Fantastic sliders!! Perfect size that you can try more than one!  Fried chicken slider, BLT slider, monte cristo and Cuban were all fantastic!  Now for Donuts to go!!",2
2,"Disappointing for brunch. Had reservations but stood in line for quite a while because the staff couldn't seem to figure out what was going on (hostess seemed inexperienced and a bit frantic). Seemed to be a total of two menus for the whole restaurant (they apologized repeatedly for the lack of menus), so tables had to wait to see a menu. Pancakes and huevos were okay, but I found a long hair baked into my pancake, which ended my enjoyment. A comfortable space and a nice location, so was sad not to have a better experience.",0
5,"My wife and I visited this hidden gem today and were not let down. The shop was clean, bright, colorful, and comfortable. We were able to sample all the flavors, listen to the story of how they came about, and walked off with many bags of deliciousness. The owners there were so kind. They took the time to understand exactly what kind of foods we enjoy to match us up with the perfect popcorn. Definitely coming back soon!",2
5,"Finally! A good tapas place in Nashville. Friendly staff, nice open kitchen, delicious food. I can't wait to go back and try more.",2
1,by far the WORST effort at chain mexican food. I thought this was a sister restaurant of the The Lime ( now called the Green Lemon)  and gave it a shot.  Terrible food. My wife gave me a bit of her guacamole and it tasted like water mush. one their smoky salsas tasted metallic.   DO NOT GO!!!,0
3,"They're still there.  The place is scrupulously clean, as clean as it was when it was new, both up front and in the men's room.Decor is a touch above strip mall restaurants.  Some nice wall art.  Neither sterile, nor cluttered.I'm not much on pork barbecue, so I got their chicken dinner, and a sampling of the shredded beef (brisket?) barbecue. One with mild sauce, and one with sweet sauce.I wanted to like it more, but it didn't wow me.  Maybe I'm just too used to the broiled chicken with sides at Kroger. The chicken is pink like people say it's supposed to be.  The beef bbq was also very tender.  The cole slaw was great.  The potato salad was different than the Kroger/Marsh potato salad that I'm used to, so I'm not sure how to rate it.For dine-in, food is served in styrofoam clam-shells, on a cafeteria tray, with plastic utensils.Service is friendly.  The folks there are cheerful and nice.Address is Rucker Rd, which crosses Binford at that point.  The restaurant is essentially on Binford, two blocks north of 62nd street, or one block south of 65th street.  Turn West at the flashing light.The good service, ambience, and cleanliness make the value a solid 3 (out of 5) for me.  However, if one were to rate just the food quality/quantity, I'd say it was a tad overpriced.   But I'm okay with paying a little bit more to support the independent family restaurateur and a clean pleasant place to dine in.",1
2,Ok wow. What a let down. 1. The only reason it gets two stars is because the sushi roll called the superdome  was good. 2. Service took forever. 2.5 hours from sit down to paying bill and we were in a hurry. 55 min for a drink. 3. Fried Chicken was over cooked to the point that we could not cut it. Knowing what I know now I would only sit at the bar and order a drink and sushi and watch some TV. I would have be very happy when I walked out. So next time that's what I'm going to do.,0
4,"Fun stop. Service was subpar. Ordered the adult orange sundae- description was mesmerizing on the menu, presentation and taste a little lackluster. But, all of the actual food was delicious. My grilled cheese (add apples and turkey) was divine- kale salad a nice touch. Everyone else had great meals too- pesto chicken sandwich, even my daughters pb&j.  But this place is all about the kitsch factor- keep your expectations in check and ignore the sour puss servers and you'll enjoy the visit. Ask for one of the soap opera booths :)",2
5,"To me, Bar Uncommon is my neighborhood bar and also one of THE bars/lounge/whatever you want to call it of New Orleans.Located in the clean, stylish, and modern Renaissance Pere Marquette New Orleans hotel on Common (get it bar Uncommon( on common)? play on words tee hee, sorry) - The bar is next to the lobby and features three main seating areas and two private rooms. Two of the seating areas have chess with some pretty elaborate chess pieces and the ceiling has bubble glasswork illuminated by red light - again I say this bar is probably one of those wannabe New York ultralounges - with abstract vasework and the bar itself lit up with blue light and clear glass. But enough with the decorations. The real star of the bar is Chris McMillian and on some nights you'll catch his wife being his barback. To me, Chris does seem out of sorts in this bar - a New Orleans oldtimer in a modern designed bar - however it somehow just...fits. He plays Jazz standards rather than the expected dance beats and it's absolutely fits in with the atmosphere and when you strike up a nice buzz the Jazz just makes the mood perfect - but the real deal is the drinks. Chris know everything about anything related to drinks. Ask him to make you some New Orleans standards - Sazerac, Ramos Gin Fizz, Mint Julieps, etc - and he'll make the best you ever had, all with top quality liquor and fresh ingredients. My favorite of his is the Gin Doe - Gin and Ginger - sweet and with that spicy bite of ginger. His Pimm's Cup is loaded with fresh fruit and just everything is great. Ask him about the history of each drink and he'll give you full detail. So don't get your crappy mixed drinks like jack and coke or a beer - ask Chris to make you a specialty, and even if you don't like gin or vodka, you'll like his drinks. He especially takes a liking to younger folks who have a genuine interest in cocktails and history - good guy and you'll learn a lot. Be warned though - he may seem unfriendly at first but he's not. And make sure you have some extra money in hand - if you'll let him and if he has the time - he'll make you several drinks for you to enjoy. And make sure to always leave a significant tip because the work he puts in it is elaborate.If Chris isn't at the bar stop on by MiLa next door and see if Shawn's working - another great bartender who experiments with drinks also (ask for the Strawberry Fields Forever drink). The clientele are mainly out of towners who are staying at the Pere Marquette, New Orleans yuppies - all of which are mainly friendly and unsnobby people. Catch Bar Uncommon before the riffraff from Le Phare and Republic find out about this place - most of the time this bar is very quiet and very few people - but the atmosphere, the drinks, and the bartender make every stop fabulous.",2
5,"The food here is great. They're quick and the staff is so nice, seriously. I always feel welcome when I place my order here.",2
1,"WHAT HAPPENED?!  We've been visiting the owner's other place, EPICE, more than Kalamatas.  Today the food here was awful.  Nice remodeling job but They changed the steak seasoning and the fattoush salad dressing...not a good idea.  We sat next to a lady who overheard us & agreed...this place is LOST.  Everything's just thrown together.  The rice must be leftover from Friday.  DISAPPOINTED!!!!!",0
4,"I've been to Lucky Belly twice and had two very different experiences. One was on a Thursday evening around 8 just to try the spiked milkshakes (worst service of my life, gross milkshake) and the other was a random drop-in while waiting on my mom while she was at the dentist at 4 in the afternoon. Had the old boy cocktail, yellowtail sushi, and burger. That burger and fries was heaven on earth, people!!! The fries had the most wonderful spice that I can't quite place, and service was lovely. Glad I decided to stop in again unexpectedly!",2
2,"The food was good, but that was the only thing that was. Long lines, sullen service. One of the counter people just seemed to wander off. One funny thing---the counter person made a big deal of using her safe serve wrappers to grab a bagel, just as the grumpy old guy who calls you for your order showed up with two completely unprotected fists full of bagels. Well, funny but also gross.",0
4,I like that they had water stations for the conference goers.  I was able to stay hydrated.,2
5,"I am so impressed with how Hotel Provincial handled my situation. Kerri was helping me coordinate rooms & brunch for my daughter's wedding. We were blocking off an entire courtyard section for my group. Plus getting ready to plan a brunch for the morning after in the hotel's newly renovated event area. Well...the reception that was to take place next door at the Old Ursuline Convent fell through due to the fact that our group was not going to fit in their space. Kerri was able to cancel all our plans, refund me the little deposit I put down on some of the rooms...and she did it all so graciously!  Thank you, Kerri! I would have loved to stay at Hotel Provincial.  It's location is so convenient to the French Quarter and after being there on site I can say that area feels really safe.",2
5,"Oh, that tiramisu! So good! Parts of it were a little dry, but I still give it 5 stars. Kind of pricey though. Next time, I'll probably try the cheesecake.",2
1,"This place is not to be trusted. I came in with my brother and said I would co-sign a lease for him when they came back with numbers inflated 3 times what the Hyundai site advertises. We walked off the lot. They kept calling my brother telling him to come in they would do the deal at that advertised price. UNBEKNOWNST to me they ran the entire lease under my social without my permission and told me as after the paperwork was signed. SCUM BAGS. I called the next day to complain and they blew me off for two weeks straight with excuse until the tags were released DON""T GO HERE. they are DIRTY. We own a car dealership and I happen to know tags do not drop 36 hours after being tricked into signing a lease contract on my good credit when it was supposed to go in the other persons name. I am getting an attorney and suing for fraud.",0
5,If u want a some deal use the coupon out of the discovery Indy coupon. U only save a dollar not with it. It was more before the change.  It has a great smell when u walk in.,2
1,"Not sure what the buzz is about this place.  I have neighbors who swore to me this was the best pizza I ever tasted.  I doubted it seriously as there is no good pizza south of North Jersey, but I tried it.  Awful is all I can say... and more awful than the regularly awful Philly style pizza.  The sauce was way too acidic.  I think they tried to compesate with sugar, but it just tasted like sweetened sauce made from rotten tomatos.  The topping look like reheated frozen nuggets of meat someone found in the back of a freezer that hadn't been cleaned out in over a year.  We have done delivery and each time it seems to get worse.  Our last deliver not only was the food boarderline ineatible, but the pizza was delivered with all the cheese piled into the corner due to the driver taking some turns a little too sharply or tilting the box on its side... Either way, that was the last we will order from them for sure.On the positive side... they did earn 1 star for being fast.",0
5,"Probably the best White Russian I've ever had in my life and it was only $5.50.  Staff was super friendly and the location was conveniently close to the crazy bar scene, but also hidden in a little nook of chill and recharge",2
3,The course is wide open but really long. Greens are in decent condition but some of the fringe areas are hot garbage. Decent value for the price. However the club house leaves a lot to be desired. The men's room is an absolute disaster. It smelled and was in barely working condition.,1
1,"Here's an update for my further Comcast experience. Our bill was increased to 250.00 a month. We called and removed some luxery items which brought our bill to 225.00 a month. Called 4 time a to see how we could get our bill lowered, as we have been a loyal customer for 14 years. ""Nothing we can do"" was all I heard. We decided to no longer be raped by this company and set up service with Verizon. Called Comcast to cancel once we got hooked up with Verizon. All of a sudden, they can do better and reduce my bill to 140.00 a month....which I would have been extremely happy with. Unfortunately, it should have been offered the four previous times I called.  I have Verizon now and have been quite happy with the installation, customer service, and overall product.  I wish Comcast would go under because they don't care about quality customer service. They could offer me a years free of service, yet I wouldn't take it on principle. Screw you Comcast!",0
1,"Easily the worst meal I had in five days of eating out 2x a day in Philly.  Server recommended the pork sandwich over their cheesesteak - I thought, this is Philly, how could I go wrong with pork?  Wrong - pork was nice, roll was great, and they ruined it with canned gravy.Drinks were nothing to write home about, and the place is basically a dive bar.  You could do so much better.  Everything here seems to be right out of the freezer or can.",0
4,Excellent service! Great diner food and breakfast is served all day. Came here for lunch- they were busy but very friendly and hospitable. Easy to get to off the 295.,2
3,"Not bad. Prices are very reasonable, service is friendly. This place works like a subway: you go in, pick a size and start adding ingredients which you can see. Sizes are deceiving and pack more of a punch than you'd think, based on just looking at them. That being said, a large bowl may or may not be enough for a hungry person, and the lack of additional sides or other items to quench your appetite may leave you either ordering another bowl, or seeking munchies elsewhere.",1
4,"Cute little spot to grab a coffee. Seats are limited. Salads and paninis are great. I've been here twice and the only downside I would have to say is that the staff appears to be constantly frantic/unhappy (probably because of how many people are constantly waiting to be seated). If you have time, try this place out. Once the weather heats up, there's 4 tables out front on Main Street.",2
5,"Let's stop it with the shenanigans people. This place is the cream de la crem (yes that was intended). After scouring the dimly lit side streets and the overpriced cafes on state I stumbled upon a good cup of coffee. Delicious red eyes, coffee, an eclectic tea collection, and I don't say this lightly. THE BEST CROISSANT in the 805. First a little about moi. I am a noted croissant specialist who has munched on pastries from Paris to Brussels to Omaha and I know a thing or two about France's favorite breakfast. Good cup has manifested a croissant with a brilliantly flaky outer layer which upon the first bite reveals a soft, fresh, delectable middle. Peets coffee and Starbucks obviously lack in their pastry game due to the frozen garbage they parade around as food and the French press provides a croissant with adequate flakiness but just not the same dough. The only place which rivals good cup for its bread quality is d'angelos bakery which has the sb bread game on lock down. While it is shameful that there are no coffee shops in this town other than Starbucks open past 10pm on most nights, if you happen to walk past good cup when it is open please head in. You will be greated by an always friendly customer service team, a low key and relaxing ambiance, great beverages, and the best damn pastries and gelato around.",2
1,"This location used to be good, several years ago. About 3 years ago it started to go downhill and now it is just terrible. There were 2 people working on a Saturday evening. Nearly all the tables were full and there were people waiting to order and to pay. The sandwich that was made for me was on hard bread, burnt and barely edible. They need to either shape up or ship out.",0
3,"Conceptually awesome! My wife and I popped in early Friday evening for our first visit. The environment left us feeling as though we were at a  beach bar & restaurant. We tried two appetizers: Grilled Shrimp and Smoked Fish Spread. Both were well prepared and delicious. For entrees, Emily had the grilled snapper tacos and I had the gag grouper dinner. Both meals were delicious! The issues the exist can easily be corrected. It is summer and this is an outdoor venue. You order your food at a hut located behind the bar. However, you have to stand in the HOT sun while ordering! A canopy needs to be installed. There is no pricing listed anywhere so you order and then get surprised by what you are asked to pay. What we ordered was well worth what we paid but it would be nice to know what you are spending before you order. The only menu is a series of high-end cocktails all of which sound delicious. However, the bartenders are not adept and creating these wonderful concoctions. So the delivery is not as great as the written word. Suggestion, cocktail napkins or coasters (they won't blow away) and ice. Alcohol melts the ice so load the glass up because the Florida summer heat melts the ice also. The plastic wear is fine and works well enough but the little piece of paper in the package is not sufficient to be called a napkin. Serve and extra ""real"" napkin with the utensils. One thing for sure we will be back but at this price point, a few additional steps need to be taken by management and crew. PS: Your ""rocking"" your idea Morgan - Smile and look less stressed (even if you are). Cheers,",1
4,This is my favorite burger spot in New Orleans out side of port of call. I'm from a city that has varieties of foods and moving to New Orleans I had been very uncomfortable with the selection until I stumbled across this little spot!!!! We originally walked in when a Cinnabon being prepared for a customer caught our eye FYI the donuts and the Cinnabon is amazing! Well long story short we ended up staying for a min and ordering the burger between wedges and chees burgers and chicken something (lol wasn't my favorite) but overall it was ALL great I'm a happy every other week customer now,2
4,"You'll basically have to go week-to-week for when they're open. Sometimes, the Sunday buffet is served but not all. Sometimes, they'll be opened until 7:00 on weekdays. They're still dark on Saturdays. It seems they are concentrating on their catering and private party events. The mini-buffet is still stocked with the same yummy Southern-based veggies and meats you're accustomed to.",2
2,Place is empty and there is a 40 minute wait. The problem I have is the snooty attitude of the waitress. Then  after ourlong wait we found out people called in and she said she caught us kissing at the sunset and said how cute we were. Luv her then she showed us to the table before the server came. Which is Tom...was is phenomenal!,0
2,"I used to hang out at Bubinga back in the day.  It seems like nothing has changed, the same old tired house/rap music and the same old Cali-crowd.  Seriously, the women are more plentiful and hotter at Brew Bros.  I also hate the all-you-can-drink cheap vodka deal not only because it's a stupid idea with very small servings of vodka, but it makes everyone at the club hog the bars continually filling up their stupid cups which means I get NO service even though I'm buying MORE alcohol and paying MORE and probably tipping MORE.  I'm not a prima donna and saunter up to the bar expecting preferential treatment.  I expect to wait my turn, but I don't expect the bartender to keep passing over me and serve idiots who just walked up to the bar and for whatever reason, they're shockingly ugly or something, the bartender notices them before me.  I have no idea why this always seems to be happening to me.  I lean over, I have my cash at hand, (which means less time to process than a credit card hence more time for bartenders to make money), and I'm ready to go.  Service always sucks here.  I'll stick with Brew Brothers and Rise.",0
5,Awesome place. I LOVE the food!  They were friendly. I ended up having them cater my sons graduation party. Carol is great,2
5,"My 8 friends and I came here during our visit to Nashville because of good reviews we heard from friends who visited - they did not disappoint.  Tavern was a great brunch spot and they were able to accommodate our large group fairly easily.  The service was awesome, relaxed and friendly staff all around.  The food was phenomenal - We split almost every app on the menu, all very good.  I had the special taco scramble and it was one of the best egg dishes I've had in a while.  The ""white trash hash"" that came with it was delicious and a twist on the classic hashbrowns.  All in all I would come back here and would recommend to anyone visiting.",2
5,"This place is beautiful to stay. Loud music shouldn't bother you if you stay here though. If you can get over the loud music then stay here. Clean,friendly, and food is great.",2
5,My colleague and I were in town for a conference and wanted to make sure we made the most during our time in New Orleans! There is not better tour in New Orleans! This is a must do when in town. Thank you Leon for keeping the history alive and your continued activism throughout the years in New Orleans.,2
4,"This place is at the end of the pier and is awesome.  Had some great clam chowder.  Not too many seats, only about 4 or 5 outside and some more inside but this is the best food on the pier.  We got lucky to find parking on the pier. However, it looked like it could be hard to find open spots during peak hours.",2
4,Great neighborhood place. They fry up some good food and their Mac and cheese is super yummy!,2
4,"The pizza was good, though a little overpriced in my opinion. The atmosphere was nice and the location convenient. I would definitely go again.",2
3,"Easy to get to when you get you luggage, but it is a bit of a challenge if  you have not been there before when  you return your car.  If you show up later at night there are very few options for vehicles.  If you are an Emerald Club member then getting your car is easy and if you use their app it is even easier at the checkout.",1
5,"What's not to like? Craft brews and wine, plenty of seating, giant twinkle lights and music! I love this indoor/outdoor space. It's a great extension to the restaurant- a secret little hideaway in the middle of downtown. Mini pizzas on the menu and over 40 beers on the menu including a solid selection of local beers and locally produced wines.  Definitely a fan!",2
4,"Really cute new burger joint... Kind of a rustic grey decor that sets the tone for its exotic array of beef, elk, boar, and goat burgers. I had the elk and it was fantastic...",2
5,Michael is an awesome bartender! So personable and knows his drinks. The atmosphere here is great. It is calm and relaxing while still being enjoyable. I don't come to indianapolis often but I will be sure to come back here. Definitely enjoyable!,2
4,This is such a great place for yummy sushi. And it's fun for kids. The prices are very reasonable. And there's a cool table for a large group that you can sit in without shoes.,2
5,Went to this place for an interior detail and the guy did a great job and it was cheap!  I left happy.,2
3,"Definitely NOT your typical American style Mexican restaurant ...If Mexican restaurants in Tennessee could be referred to as a ""dive"", this is it.Courteous service... helpful cook ... Very simple decor ... Concrete floor, some expected hangings on the walls, (blanket, sombrero, stars, piñatas, Spanish language TV playing in the corner, plastic table cloth, chairs with cushions !!!I ordered two chicken ""tinga"" tacos and one chicken quesadilla.I'm not adventurous and didn't want the ""tongue"" I also don't enjoy corn tortillas so my choices were limited.Although my grandmother was Puerto Rican and I've been to Mexico a bunch, I'm still more familiar with ""American style"" Mexican so I stuck to safe items that I know ... If I like it, I'll come back for more !!***okay I'm eating at home watching America's Got Talent --- and the food is amazing .... Spicy oooooohwheee .!!! I had the chicken Tinga tacos (spicy!!!!) but put the meat into my plate of Mexican rice (as I don't enjoy corn tortillas)-- mmmmm mmmm delicious -!! And the steak quesadilla was thick and full of stuff--- very plentiful! No paltry quesadilla here !! Delicious and I will be back !!!! *****Only negative side is a faint smell of cleaning liquid and some flies lingering as the swinging door frequently opens and closes. (The kitchen is actually a food truck parked outside)Also, there were some kids there with other adults (who didn't appear to be eating or working) and all I could think was how they might wish they were home.",1
5,"Today was our first visit.  My husband tried two different varieties of cold brew and enjoyed each.  I had the mango iced tea and the blueberry rooibos.  Both were flavorful and a nice size.  We also tried the peanut butter balls, which are incredible.The service was friendly and fast, and the cafe had plenty of comfortable seating.  I really enjoyed the atmosphere and look forward to coming back.  I've never seen any cafe with as many cold brew coffee varieties.",2
3,"I've been back to Megu three times over the past two months, and I was finally prompted to write an update, as on each visit I wasn't as satisfied as I have been in the past. I'm really hoping I managed to visit on off days, because if the incredibly mediocre service and the overall average sushi is more than a trend, I will be devastated. I know a new year should bring about change, but it's heartbreaking that the change at my favorite local sushi joint has been negative.",1
4,"My husband and I have dined at Ryan Christopher's on several different occasions. Every time we leave, we're stuffed and more importantly satisfied. Although we've never dined here for dinner the breakfast and lunch options are great. They have something for everyone from waffle egg sandwiches, chocolate chip pancakes, to poached pear salads and Thai chicken wraps. Everything we've tried has been tasty.  The restaurant has expanded their seating area. They removed the bar/ griddle area and have introduced a larger seating area. In the warmer months you can done outside. I'm giving it a 4 because the service, although friendly, is not always attentive.",2
5,"Love AJ's! They have the best Strawberry Lemonade around town and all they're baked goods and hot plates are delicious! If I could, I'd go here more often! Great selection store-wide of things you don't often find in other supermarkets.",2
5,"It is a true Italian market. They have a wide selection of fresh groceries: meats, pasta (yes, fresh pasta), breads, and cheeses. They also have a very large selection of frozen pasta and pre made pasta dishes to take home for a quick dinner. They have a sandwich counter that also has fresh made dishes (lasagna, chicken/eggplant parmigiana, ravioli, manicotti, etc). There's a coffee/espresso bar, bakery, wine cellar and cheese room as well. I haven't had anything there that I haven't LOVED! I like to take advantage of the panini of the day when I can make it in. The time if recommend to go is during the fall. They have pumpkin ravioli and gnocchi, pumpkin cheesecake drink, and a thanksgiving inspired panini.",2
5,"When this place first popped up on my phone as hot and new, I was so excited to try this place! It's always so exciting to try new cafes and ice cream places that pop in Reno since there really isn't many trendy places like these. It was interesting to see the cute wired sign and pink wall. The man at the register said him and his fiancé started this business so I wish them both luck! He was very welcoming very informative. The soft serve is so creamy-- the way it should be. The flavors are so yummy, it was nice to see familiar flavors like Ube and green tea. For some suggestions maybe a Thai tea or strawberry flavor? It was nice that we were offered pocky sticks to add to our krem creation. Maybe next time if adding wafer sticks or some type of cookies would be nice. I got the ube baby baby and it was delicious! I'll definitely be back for more!",2
1,"Why did it just take over 5 minutes for me to get only a medium coffee?  Because there wasn't any coffee made in a coffee establishment, that's why. In addition, there are non-customers sitting in all of the outdoor seats and the floors and counters are sticky. I'm done with this Cosi. I'll be going to Brew Ha Ha from now on. The customer service is just too poor here.",0
5,"I have had James do all my appliance repairs since I remodeled the kitchen in 2009. He was originally recommended by the retailer where purchased my appliances and he has never disappointed me. I have had some issues with my washer and dryer, he always solves the problem while being  pleasant and professional. He arrives on time cleans up after the work is finished. He is fair in his pricing and I have always enjoyed his courteous and helpful suggestions regarding the equipment. This week my Microwave died on Monday and he was by and it was fixed on Tuesday!Thanks James!!",2
5,"Never had Malaysian food before eating here, but it's extremely good.  Roti canai was an excellent appetizer, almost better than the breads at dedicated Indian restaurants.  The noodle dishes are also delicious.  Atmosphere was great; I'll be back soon.",2
4,"Fresh ingredients that you chose from a large selection, Cooking sauce of your design, Helpful to those of us who need a little help carrying stuff, Wine and beer, what's not to like?As mentioned by others, you walk in, grab a table and go back and ponder the large Barbeque bar. Lots of veggies, meat and some seafood. One pass or unlimited, all you can eat style, it's your choice. Add their soup and bread and you are good to go for the price point you select.You have to envision what the raw ingredients are going to look like after they are cooked. Obviously, a bowl overflowing with raw veggies and meat is going to be quite a bit smaller when cooked as shown in the pictures online. Good service and helpful and friendly staff. We found it to be very clean given that most of any mess is customer created when they are sloppy loading their bowl. I wish they had lamb as many of this style restaurant do. Next time I will really up the ""Hot"" quotient in the saucing. It is an experience, you cannot really duplicate this as a sit down, point and order restaurant. It is not picking out dim sum as it passes by.",2
2,Went here on the spur of the moment after looking at the menu on yelp. My friends didn't want to stay so I ordered my food to go. They brought it out on plates and then took 15 minutes to put it in a box. After getting home I realized the bottom of the flatbread was burnt and inedible. The truffle Mac was ok.,0
4,Healthy and simple dishes.  Fresh.  Not overcooked.  I've only ordered off the Asian menu.  I love the Bangkok curry with tofu.  Their tofu is cut to the perfect size and has a nice firmness.  The Thai curry soup is also awesome.,2
2,"I gave them a 2 star because of their jet ski rental employees . MATT the  supervisor there is unfit to handle/supervise employees. I went there to rent a locker while I go swimming and one of the employees yells ""20$!"" I replied"" wow okay ""..he replied ""what did you think you would get it for free"" and then Matt was right next to him smiled .. is that how you treat the customers paying for your bills ? Avoid the rental station so you won't have to experience the employees .",0

3,"Run by the same people as Knifewear next door, this is definitely a ""man's store"" stocked with every kind of shaving supply imaginable, particularly items for straight-blade shaves. There is also a large selection of axes and knives for camping or outdoor work. The staff seemed knowledgable and friendly. A great place to get gifts for the men in our lives.",1
1,"$20 for a Chimay? Toxic fumes from the non-stop traffic on Florida Avenue. Hyde Park wannabe/oxygen thieves hang out. All you hear at this place is, ""so what do you do? What do you drive?' I don't care if it's only a few blocks bike ride from my house, it's not worth it.",0
5,"We had several quotes, with Pete and Ron's being the best of those I considered reputable. When i told Arbour Bay I was going with Pete and Ron they told me I would be in good hands. Had 2 very large oaks, one inaccessible from the front yard, one less than 2 feet from my roof edge taken down with a crane. I left for work in the A.M. and when I got home at 4 the trees were gone. Minimal damage from the heavy equipment in my yard. Will definitely recommend to friends and neighbors.",2
4,"Stunning hotel, great service and a fantastic brunch!! The best beignets in Nola! The hotel is old and can get a little loud if you're on the street side however so take that into account when booking. The carousel bar is great but can get crowded if they have live music. Go early for a pre dinner drink!",2
5,"Love love love! This place!!!  We were in town visiting for my birthday weekend and winded up here after a wasted experience at Warm Daddys. There are so many good things to say I will break it down.LOCATION: this place shares a parking lot with Longhorn Steakhouse so there are plenty of spaces. Its also near a best buy, etc so should you have to wait you can shop around. Although we didnt wait at allLAYOUT: Being from baltimore, we wanted to watch the 1pm game a/g Pittsburgh. The Eagles game was at 4pm. There were PLENTY tvs all around to watch ANY football game you wanted. There are plenty of seats all of which you can view the TVs if you wanted with a bar area in the middle of the floor as well.ATMOSPHERE: family friendly and clean! I especially liked the fact that during commericals for the main game, they played music and as soon as the game came back on the music stopped. This is atypical of some places, as they play music the whole time and you only can read the close captioning while watching the game.DRINKS: Drink menus are very important to me. I like variety and boy did this place had it. They had various drink concoctions they put together that seemed very interesting! I had two of their different drinks and was not disappointed by either of them.DESSERTS: Delish!!! My friend got the mile-high cake and wow!!! This stands at least 6 inches high with about 6 layers. For only $8, this fed the whole table!APPETIZERS: DO NOT leave there without trying the crab bread, and that says alot for someone coming from Baltimore. There's also this special dipping sauce that comes with it? Exquisite!! I couldnt get enough. The spinach/artichoke appetizer was definitely a treat as well.ENTREES: the fajitas are to die for, i had the cajun shrimp pasta which was good. The salmon was bland, but the bbq chicken sandwiches were great! A friend had grilled chicken greek salad and the chicken was plentiful.  Also for you health food nuts, all the nutritional facts are posted for EVERYTHING, even the drinks.Next time I go back to Philly, i will be coming back.",2
2,"Too big, too expensive and too far from Downtown.  I was here for a conference, which seemed like an awesome idea. It wasn't.  I'm in Direct Sales and (like most people at this conference) don't have tons of extra money to spend on mediocre meals when I'm traveling.  $10 for a slice of generic pizza, small side salad and a soda for lunch.   I understand it's a hotel but there weren't any options close by.  Just getting your car from valet was a hassle and took a lot of time.  Being such a big property, it made getting to restaurants off the property really time intensive.  Since you're so far out of Nashville (out near the airport), the good little holes you find when you're in a city are pretty nonexistent.  The property itself was great.  The hotel is HUGE but really pretty.  I enjoyed walking around but was really happy when I found what I didn't know existed...a shortcut between my room and the Convention Center.  It took my 10-15 minute walk down to about 3 minutes!  BONUS!  Like I said, this place is ginormous.  Room: Our room was great.  I shared a wonderful suite in the Garden Conservatory with 2 other girls.  We were under a group rate and my friend was quoted $200/night, which is awesome for the space we had.  We had a large room (probably used as a hospitality suite for groups) for socializing.  It had a great bar area set-up and a nice big fridge and lots of drawer space.  Our bedroom was separated by doors that could be locked from either side (like an adjoining room), so it looked like the hospitality suite could be reserved without reserving the room.  It was different than what I was expecting, but whatevs.  It was fine.  So, I wasn't there at check-in.  The girl who reserved the room checked in a couple days earlier than my friend and I.  So, Sunday comes, and the bill was waiting for us when we woke up.  Our friend was charged $1200 for one room (I'm guessing the suite) and $1400 for the other room.  YEP.  She reserved what she thought was a 2 room suite for $200.  The bedroom door was closed when she got there and she asked them to open it up. It was all arranged by the bellman.  She was never told that the bedroom wasn't included....kind of necessary if you're staying over for 6 nights, dontcha think???  So, she's being charged $2600 for what was supposed to be $1200.  Last I heard, the Gaylord's legal department was investigating what she was told, what she wasn't told and if they should charge her the entire amount.  Checkout:  A FREAKING NIGHTMARE.  Between the money situation, which was not resolved as of late this week, and the 45 minute wait for a cart (in a hotel that holds thousands of people, you'd think they'd be plentiful and they aren't) and a 25 minute wait for the car, my friend and I decided to sweat it out and schlep our goods to the door where our car would be delivered to us.  It was not a short walk and we had a TON of stuff, which meant multiple trips.  UGH.I'm sure I'll be back for another conference (I am pretty sure my company has booked this for at least one more year....) but I'm not going to be happy about it.  I might even consider driving down, staying in a hotel somewhere downtown and driving out to the Conference stuff.",0
5,"We've been going to the Rib Cook-Off for a few years now, but apparently I've never taken the time to review it. We have our day pretty much planned out before heading down there. We walk to the bus stop by our house, the bus takes us directly to the Sparks bus station for a whopping $2 each. No parking, no driving through crowds, and no paying for parking. Winning.From the bus station, we head immediately to Great Basin to get a large Icky and Bitchin' Berry. Beer is a must for battling these crowds and the large beers are worth the price!If you have the JA Nugget mobile app, it will tell you where every vendor is and show it on a map. No more mindless wandering looking for your favorite vendor. I don't have a favorite, but go off of recommendations from friends, co-workers, etc.Some vendors take cards, but we always make sure to bring plenty of cash. Be sure to walk through the non-rib vendors too. We got a couple of hats this year, which are nice to have at the event, but are also great beach hats for next year.Saturday was a whole day affair and required us taking a cab back home. But because there was practically no crowd on Monday, we were able to get a beer, some food, and still use our bus transfer to get back home. Food stops being served at 5:00 pm on Monday and the vendors also start selling off extra food at crazy cheap prices.",2
3,"Came in for a mid-week lunch with a co-worker.Service is casual, on the friendly (but brisk) side, which was not a problem. The presentation isn't fancy, it's definitely simple with light decor.I ordered a croque-monsieur, which came nicely toasty with a generous helping of sliced tomatoes. The sandwich itself was quite nice, with flavorful ham. Unfortunately, the tomatoes were on the mealy side and didn't add much to the plate.Overall a very middle-ground experience, perhaps another dish will hit the right spot some other time. Definitely a big plus that they are attached to La Baguette-- treat yourself on the way out.",1
5,"We called ahead and picked up at the drive through window after leaving the kids ballgame. We ordered 3 kids meals and a poboy. The kids meals came with fries, yogurt, a rice krispy treat and a drink for $5 each. The kids were full, the food was good and it was all for 26 dollars. The shrimp and burgers are both really good. We will be back.",2
4,"Aside from the staff being super friendly, the food is quite tasty and the environment is super chill yet a little hectic at the same time but it somehow works. What I appreciated the most about Milktooth, is you can really tell the food is made with good quality ingredients. I definitely had my heart set on the Sweet Tea Chicken Fried Biscuit and was a little bummed to hear they were sold out. However, the little bear plate was simple, yet delicious and paired nicely with a side of savory whey grits. Also, the slow drip coffee is on point .Overall, Milktooth is a great addition to the Fletcher Place/Fountain Square area. I'm looking forward to spending many weekends at this place.",2
1,"Service horrible. 3rd visit here hoping this place makes it since it's local, but I doubt it. When are they going to hire some experienced help that are not uninterested teenagers? First two trips couldn't get bartender to acknowledge us without flagging down, tonight icing on the cake. Do not waste your time. Waitresses walking by, like.we were invisible. Got up, found waitress asked for service.....never came back. Owner made excuses. Sorry to see you go overpriced Craft House.",0
5,"Johnny thank you for cater the luncheon at the New Castle County Courthouse.I had cops from Phila, New York, Arizona and all of them agree this was the best pizza, chicken finger and hot wings they  had since being in Delaware .I had Officers from Dover and Kent County and  they said it was worth the trip coming up for the food. Johnny everything was excellent ..THANK YOU",2
5,"I can't say enough about Anthony and Johnathan as a woman I felt comfortable there, they didn't try to sell me anything that I didn't need, I dropped my car off at 7:30 and at 10:00 I got an email that it was ready!!! they had gave me a courtesy ride to my husbands job in the area, and came back and got me!!! the prices were reasonable and I would definitely do business with them again :)",2
5,Wonderful experience and amazing food. We sat at the food prep counter and could watch the chefs prepare dishes. It was really cool to watch and they were all very friendly and communicative. We were even greeted with a complimentary tasting when first seated. Loved everything about the experience!,2
5,"This review is for a corporate event in a private dining room with a limited food menu & bar. I was blown away! One of the best meals I've ever had and service was flawless, expert, courteous, and never intrusive. Passed hors d'ouevres were creative and tasty. Lobster consommé was delicious and filet was PERFECTLY cooked & seasoned, melted in my mouth, and a generous portion. And that view is just stunning! Actually a better view from our private room than the main dining room, where I've been for a happy hour event (which was less perfect since the space was very overbooked resulting in slow service). Highly recommend for an event and may be back here for a special occasion dinner.",2
5,"A very simple and very casual Nashville staple sits across from Vanderbilt University on 21st Ave., South. The food is phenomenally basic but completely predictable. it's the atmosphere that you are coming for and that's the five star experience. Service with a smile. Get a bucket of reasonably priced beer and some tacos or chips and sit outside. As so much has changed in the surrounding area this place remains a true neighborhood constant. Obviously better to enjoy in the nicer weather as eating indoors just doesn't have the same appeal as the outdoor opportunity. Heads-up-- parking  is almost nonexistent but you can try The neighborhood or simply walk or Uber from your hotel.",2
5,"I purchased the yelp deal for $155.  What a great deal.  I called and scheduled a time for the much needed help.  My very first phone interaction was with Cory.  He asked a few general questions then asked me what day I needed help on.  He then followed up with a confirmation call the day before my move and again a hour before he was scheduled to begin.  He arrived at the scheduled time with a partner ""Deron"".  They treated my items as if they were they're own.  They were professional, friendly, and FAST.  I will use this company again.",2
5,"Preface - I LOVE Pizza.  So even when this place was under construction I already had my sights set on it.  Finally was able to get there yesterday and let me tell you, it did not disappoint.  I went on a Friday night and I was expecting a bit of a wait given that it is still the new hotspot, but to my surprise for my group of 4 the hostess said it would be a 15-20 minute wait and we were seated in about 10 minutes.  Prompt seating = bonus.  We sat around the kitchen bar counter and so got to enjoy watching them make pizza all night long.  Ok on to the food.  I read from other reviews that the ritolo was a must try and indeed it is a must try.  They are relatively small so if you get two (which we did) its not a big deal.  We got the crudo pizza and the margerita pizza.  The pizza dough on both was perfect, a bit crispy but still chewy and full of flavor.  We got the crudo pizza and the margerita pizza.  The crudo pizza was our favorite out of the two.  Its a bit bigger than a personal pizza, so perfect for two people to share.  Then came the dessert, I was not expecting much from the dessert as this is a pizza place, but we ordered the fried dough and the cappacino soft serve ice cream.  The ice cream blew us away.  Perhaps the best ice cream we have ever had.  One of the people in our group was lactose intolerant and even she said screw it and had some of the ice cream, it was that good.  On a side note, toward the end of our dinner vetri came in and was talking to the various chefs and employees.  Kind of cool to see him in the restaurant.Overall an awesome experience that lived up to our expectations and then some.  Will definitely be making this a regular place.",2
5,"Well we went back again for dinner and we were far more pleased. I got the seared tuna which was incredibly tasty. My friends got other types of fish and chicken and waffles. All were really fantastic. We had gotten nachos as an app and each chip was individually dressed as perfect bites. You have to appreciate that kind of detail! Decent portion sizes. Great flavors and service. Even the sodas and beer list had a lot of gems. I would definitely go back again, just not get the eggs benedict at brunch again ;-)",2
4,Not as cool as the one in 12th South but it's hard to create something hip in the middle of not hip suburbia. Burger Up. Gets high marks for getting it close. Go sit at the bar. It's less hectic. Great cocktails ( bartenders are  amazing!). Fried pickles and the quinoa burger. Yum. Get there early. Remember it's Cool Springs. They roll up the carpets at 8:30. Or is it that everyone heads to Drakes?,2

5,"I love the waxing method from EWC! Less pain, no irritation (I have sensitive skin) and they don't double dip the part that they spread the wax with. I usually go with Despina or Jenny.",2
2,"I heard of this place through a friend who is a chef. I was told the food was amazing, and the atmosphere was to die for. Unfortunately I didn't have the time of my life. As I look around, people are really enjoying themselves. The atmosphere is really friendly, but I also see a lot of food left on the plate. I ordered the Belgium waffle and the aroma of the salt on the waffle was very overwhelming. Long story short, the food was not up to par. I was very disappointed. The water wasn't cold, many items on the menu were sold out, and the ones they did have, they didn't allow any modifications to. The coffees were small and it was very hot inside. I really wanted to like this place. Unfortunately we didn't receive good service nor did we get a chance to even order what we wanted.",0
5,"Loved, Loved, Loved Annlyn!My wife and I recently were looking for a place and Annlyn was GREAT. She made us feel at home before we ever saw an apartment. The building is loaded with amenities ( a massage room, fitness room, rooftop, way more than I can even describe- truly fabulous)  I highly recommend Fusion1560 and I  recommend you deal with Annlyn.",2
5,awesome place!!!! very dope setting large party can crash and chill....staff here super nice.... i broke a glass of a beer and they hooked me one for free without even hesitation... awesome!! great place great beer thanks all the staff for great hospitality!!!,2
4,"Drifted far north of my orbit to try this gym out, I've already been to 66th Street location a few times. Still can't believe I get free gym as a SilverSneakers member. The huge open area here is different, and being a Saturday afternoon I thought it would be packed but no. Maybe they were all Christmas shopping.  It's always inspiring to see people my age and older working out and taking care of themselves. Pleasant young man greets you at front desk. As other reviewers mention, no pool or sauna is missed, but they are a bargain for the pay-as-you-go price. All equipment is spotless and the floor shiny clean, what's not to like?It's tucked into a strip mall at an angle from Publix, can't be seen from the highway so they should put up a tall sign.",2
5,Went there last night with a party of 6. Was seated right away at a table in the back. The server was fantastic.As for the food.....Spicy feta was to die for. The garlic potato dip was exceptional. I got the shrimp in lemon and oil as the main course. The shrimp were cooked over charcoal and that made all the difference. Skipped dessert since we were there for my birthday and we had cake at the house. I left stuffed and I cannot wait to return.,2
4,"Now this is a hometown diner. We went for breakfast and we will be back another time soon for lunch. A duster restaurant to burg bar & grill, this gem had a ton of breakfast and lunch options with some added Greek flare and a touch of Cuban dishes. To this native Floridian it's the fun options you'd expect to see at a local diner. I got the mama mias eggs Benedict which included spinach and mushrooms. I selected crispy hash browns as my side and it also came with a banana and strawberry. It was so good I wish there was less hollandaise since it was so good it didn't need that much. The guys got the Hungry Greek and an omelet and we were all happy. Choices between potatoes, hash browns and grits ensured there were options for everyone.  A banana and strawberry for everyone too.  Portions were large, prices good and the choices abundant. We had Aly as our waitress and she was great! Friendly and awesome some recommendations. Check this place out for sure!",2
4,"This is a great late brunch option during the weekends when the big morning rush dies down after 1 pm. Usually there is no wait or 5 minute wait at this time. One big complaint is that they don't have an organized system for seating guests. The servers don't always greet incoming patrons (which should be required Waffle House-style) and they sometimes tell you to seat yourself (which can lead to one or two people taking up tables for 4) or they'll seat you (whenever they get around to talking to you). I've ordered a several different dishes at this point and they have varies from ok to awesome. The chicken wings and onion rings are just ok. The wings are either lightly dredged in flour or not at and then fried whole. They aren't really seasoned so the wings are pretty bland. The ""onion rings"" made of formed, chopped onions that are breaded. The chicken fingers were a bit over battered and dry. The smashwich (or whatever it's called) was pretty good: your choice of breakfast meat with hash browns and eggs in a hoagie roll, but unspectacular. The club sandwich is classic diner fare that is very well executed. The egg and omelette platters are a very good deal and dang tasty. The best thing on the menu is definitely the waffle. It's gently sweet, very crispy and covered in butter. So good!The service is generally pretty attentive (once you're seated), the restaurant and bathrooms are very clean, the food is a good, tasty value",2
5,"Amazeballs! Stopped here on my way to the airport, and it didn't disappoint. I have been here many times over the years, but now that I live out-of-town I think I appreciate it so much more. I had the half oyster po-boy and a cup of seafood gumbo and it was delicious. Flaky and soft bread loaded with oysters and seafood gumbo that was so tasty I wish I could have taken a gallon to go! I also had the raw oysters that were medium sized and nice and salty. I couldn't have asked for a better lunch before heading back to Colorado. I think you can order anything here and not be disapointed, its the real deal!",2
5,"I think it is important to reuse when possible instead of buying new. And when I shop here, I get to save money in the process! This is the absolute best place to find great deals, attentive and kind service, and cute, gently used clothes for your kids. When it is time for school clothes shopping, go there first!",2
1,"It seems this place might have been good in the past but has recently been getting worse. I'm not sure if they changed ownership or if the guy that owns it has just gotten tired of having the business but it is definitely not a place to have a good time which is what people intend on doing when they smoke a hookah. I read reviews on here before going and thought I would never visit this place until a friend of mine invited me.  I was hesitant but he talked me into coming by.  The reviews that speak of racism are correct. If your not white or Indian then definitely don't go here. (however I am a white woman and still was treated bad, perhaps becasue I came with a lady and not a man? who knows.)When we walked in the door they told us we had to order to stay but they wouldn't give us time to look at the menu. They stood over us and every 30 seconds were aggressively telling us that we had to decide on something or get out. We didn't order quick enough so they escorted us while yelling at us in their language and making rude gestures the entire way out. The owner continued to curse us as we crossed the street to leave in our car. Someone unknowingly, might think this was just a bad day. After reading others awful reviews it seems this is the norm. Unfortunate and disappointed",0
5,"Impeccable hotel with excellent service-from doorman, valet, to front desk and Carousel staff. Furnishings are perfect yet, as many older hotels,  our room size may not be considered spacious. Although the double room we chose was not ""spacious"", we always choose quality over quantity. It has the quiet construction of a wonderful old European hotel. Lively sophisticated bar /restaurant or many within just a couple blocks. Valet parking at front or in adjacent garage. I would Love to indulge at the Monteleone again!",2
5,Great coffee and in a good location.  Come here regularly and the staff are always nice,2
5,We had the tomato and mozzarella salad and ordered a grandma red pizza with red onion and mushrooms. Both were delicious. Very very good pizza. The service was good and the place itself is really fun. Definitely check it out- cash only and BYOB.,2
1,Sooo slow! I've never seen anyone that works at this location do anything at a normal pace. I'm not even asking for super speed. Just a reasonable pace.,0
5,I had a really fun girls night. I'm a big fan of the drink bowls for $25 and what a great idea that they give different color straws so you know what straw belongs to those in your group. I've had the fish bowl at graffiti bar many times and I like the taste of the bucks at howl of the moon much better. But they are very sweet and we had trouble finishing our second bucket. It is entertaining and great people watching. Bartenders are very nice. Get there early because cover goes up throughout the night.,2
5,"I simply love this place, best breakfast in New Orleans by far ...... Ok so I must say more for this to be a review!!I had banana foster French toast to die for, the shrimp and grits are perfect. Not over season with Really creamy grits & a Fresh carrot& apple juice cold and refreshing omelet with ham cheese and avocado AMAZING!!!! Diet starts soon",2
4,"The habit, chain, not a chain? I don't care!  All I do care about is this is a solid, fresh tasting burger.  Not amazing, not the best burger I've ever had, but solid.  Someone complained about all of the references to In-n-Out, but I think the comparison is completely appropriate.  The style of burger is similar and it gives a person an idea of what kind of burger to expect.  It is similar, but in my opinion, a little better.  Maybe because we of the weather, or because there was a teriyaki burger option.  Had a bit of a regular char burger too, and that was solid as well.  But my onion rings were what was really good.  Crisp and you could actually eat it with the onion.  The onion didn't come flying out the first bite like most onion rings.  The berating on them was really good.  I would also like to say how awesome it is that the habit's burgers come with caramelized onions automatically.  All burgers should.So yes, I can make a much better burger at home, but the habit makes a soli fresh tasting burger.",2
1,"Very disappointing food.  Too bad I cannot give a minus 1 star. The food was just below average and overpriced. I know Good Peruvian food, I also know a bad imitation trying to pass for decent food. The bad service was also another disappointment. Overall this place gives Peruvian Cuisine a bad name. I will never return or recommend this place.",0
3,Came here one afternoon to watch the Kings hockey game. Place is okay. Nothing really stands out about this place. The best thing I would say is that there are a lot of TVs and a projector to show the game. They have your average beers on tap for $5 bucks a pint. Good place to watch sports.,1
3,"Mr.B's has seen better days. Service is lacking (we reordered bread and never received it, Wine was brought to the table well into the main course, my soup was almost cold).The food is still good, but they really need to work on getting the service to the level it used to be.",1
5,"Food 5/5Service 5/5Atmosphere 5/5Came for lunch buffet. Tandoori chicken : flavorful, juicy (not dry from the headlamps), chicken Tikka : delicious, chili chicken  and curry chicken : both very good. Kheer (Indian rice pudding) : tastes yummy Naan : fresh, soft, and stayed soft throughout meal. Service : one lady doing so much.  I didn't have to ask for water refill, she was already there. Didn't have to ask for plate to be removed, she already did it. Hard working. Atmosphere : relaxed, has music and TV that shows how they cook. And cartoons for kids too.",2
5,So glad we found this place on Yelp. Had a Huge portion of delicious red beans and rice with pork shank and the boudin balls. Definitely recommend this place if you're in New Orleans. Not far from French Quarter with free parking.,2
1,"Salad was good.  Pizza is not good!  Boring, tasteless and just unsatisfying.  Very disappointed.  Also on a chilly night it is a cold interior.  This was my third try there.  Won't go back",0
4,"Great little restaurant tucked away in the corner of a strip of stores. They have huge (and delicious) omelets & I love their home fries. Friendly staff and very reasonable prices. I highly recommend the feta cheese omelet, it's amazing.",2
5,"i have eaten pad kee mao (drunken noodles) at every thai restaurant in the city and i hereby declare that they are best at Vientiane!  fat noodles that are a tiny bit sweet and oh so spicy (if you ask for them hot- 1-4 stars).  the staff here are just fantastic at making sure to ask you just how you like it, and then delivering.  i get my padkeemao 2 stars of spice out of 4.  my boyfriend gets his red curry extra extra spicy and",2
4,"New place, good wings, good sauces. No 5 stars: bathroom smells and no napkins. Only a giant paper towel roll, not very clean. Customer service is hit and miss. Again new place, management should get the process down in a few months. I will post again then.",2
5,"We used the party room for a bridal shower.  The events manager Deneva was wonderful to work with and followed through on every single detail.  The wait staff was fantastic, and the food was exceptional.  We will definitely work with Deneva for any future parties at Cyrano's.",2

4,"So happy to have found this treasure on Yelp!  The food was fabulous, as was the atmosphere. Had the short ribs and my husband had the lamb shank ragout -- both were delicious!  We will definitely make sure that we return!",2
5,"Jay's is my favorite place to get sushi take-out in center city.  As far as the 3 rolls for $xx.xx deals go (there are many in the area), I've tried quite a few and this is my favorite due to the price, quality, and unique selection.  They have rolls I haven't seen anywhere else.  I haven't tried the other menu selections at Jay's, so this review is based only on that.  If you want to eat in, it's not fancy and a little cramped, but everyone was very friendly and the sushi was still good.  For now, it's my #1 take-out place (I suppose Vic would be #2, for reference).  For the fancy sushi experience, I recommend Umai Umai.",2
3,"This review is for those who normally purchase diamond club tickets.  My husband and I always purchase these types of tickets at every stadium we visit and they always include a very nice buffet before the game and then during the game servers bring you anything you want to eat and drink, free of charge.  Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, and so many other stadiums know how to treat their big spenders, so I was rather surprised that Citizens Bank Park does none of this.  There is a private lounge/restaurant area for diamond club ticket holders, but no pre-game complimentary buffet.  You have to pay for everything that is in there which is also the case for everything you order at your seat.  For future games at Citizens Bank Park, I doubt we'll spend a lot of money again for diamond club seats that don't come with the perks that most other baseball  stadiums offer.",1
1,"I have visited Mucho Burrito over the years here in the Edmonton Area, but this location by far is troubled.  In my humble opinion the more negative or cautious reviews of this particular location are accurate and are consistent with my own experience of the place.For my own experience, the presentation and cleanliness of the restaurant is fine.  You are greeted with a modern looking fast food restaurant with some nice branding about clean eating.  But once you speak with staff the experience unravels.  I found staff to be more involved in whatever they are up to rather than customer service.  This can involve on going conversations amongst each other, or something else that is not readily apparent.  In any event, some staff are completely distracted or disengaged.My order took a while to come out, and it required corrections which added more time while customers continued to line up.  Within 30 minutes after enjoying the meal, I became violently ill, and the rest of my evening was basically spent nursing myself back to normal.  I made a complaint many moons ago about this to Mucho Burrito's website, but be forewarned I did not get any follow up whatsoever from them.  This is a demoralized business to the core.  If you are craving Chipotle or some other Mexican branded place, do not come here.  You will be better off for it.In fairness though, the Downtown location has been more consistent and I cannot speak for the other locations yet.",0
5,Excellent food.  Great service.  Best Miso Soup I have ever tasted.  They have an extensive menu.  My family's favorite Chinese Restaurant.,2
5,Very good hole in the wall. Got some chili fries here with my girlfriend. They were great and the service was awesome.,2
5,"Delicious things happen here. The staff is friendly and the food is scrumptious. The beer list is long and distinguished. There are so many to try, you just can't go wrong! Try the pickle chips or the wedge salad.",2
4,"I've been meaning to write a review of this place for a while. Now, to be fair, my reviews I write on Yelp need to be taken with a few grains of salt for the following reasons:1. I'm a craft beer whore2. I'm one of those annoying vegan types (ugh, I know, I hate myself, too)3. Again, I really, really like beer.So with that out of the way, let me tell you what I think about Pinocchio's Pizza.**Food- I remember going here a lot when I was little, but only recently did I return with my boyfriend one to grab some pizza. I brought my own vegan cheese (I'M SO OBNOXIOUS YES YOU CAN HATE ME) because I'm difficult, and was very excited for some pizza in my mouth. I usually am very embarrassed bringing my own cheese, even after like 7 and a half years of being a dumb vegan. But the waitress said it wouldn't be a problem to coat my pizza with this dairy mockery jawns to appease me. Holla at that! Oh, an a little hint for all of you pizza topping snobs: Pinocchio's has the right kind of olives for a pizza- ACTUAL GREEK OLIVES. Not that anemic, black, canned crap. I mean, you can get that if you want; it's on the toppings menu. The catch is, you need to ask for the Greek olives; they're offered as a side with the hummus plate (which I surprisingly didn't order the last time I was there, so I can't tell you how that was.**Service- not overtly chatty, but friendly and efficient enough. I think we went on a Friday or Saturday night and the boyf and I each ordered our own pizzas; I didn't find us waiting too long for our pizzas. **Beer- Sweet baby Jesus and all other holy figures. If you like, love, or are casually obsessed with excellent beer, stop wasting your time and get your booty over to this place. Not only is the selection incredible, all of the workers ACTUALLY KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT. I have walked in and said, ""Give me your favourite hoppy thing,"" or ""Give me something like this beer...."" and they have always suggested something wonderful. I have never left the Beer Garden dissatisfied. Not that any of us law abiding PA residents ever take beer over state lines, but if I did, I now have no reason to buy beer in Delaware. All of the beer here is fresh and you can ask whatever questions you want and not feel intimidated. Oh, and did I mention that they have about a billion awesome beers on tap that you can either enjoy with your pizza OR BRING HOME IN A GROWLER?! **Cons: You're still buying beer in PA, so only 2 take out six packs at a time, but my liver is pretty ok with that. And the parking lot there sucks. But there's street parking on Baltimore Pike (for the brave), on Gayley Street (for the less brave but still parallel parking able), and there is a lot on Gayley and State Streets (for those of us who still, after a half a decade or more of driving, cannot parallel park a compact car). The lot is metered, but is free after 5 (for sure)  and I THINK on weekends, but don't go sending me your parking tickets if I'm wrong.",2
5,This place has the best service. Every time my husband and I come we sit at the bar. We are regulars and usually Alex is there working. If you go I would recommend asking for him. He's very knowledgable about the wine selection. Although I am aware it's the not the most authentic Italian around it is still good food at an affordable price(we usually get whatever special they have going at the time). Also their bread pudding is to die for!,2
1,This hotel was nasty. There are termites and ants crawling out of the floor and up the wall in droves outside our room door. Don't stay here. I uploaded a couple of pics of the bugs outside our door. So gross.,0
4,"Looking for a delicious New Year's Day brunch was hard this year in New Orleans. We didn't want to wait in line and wanted instant gratification. Although we may have felt tired, my bf and I were appropriately dressed to go to Mr. B's. As soon as we walked in, I felt transported into a different world. Jazz music was playing and I felt at home. First of all, I could not have been more grateful for the fresh loaf of bread we were given. We devoured it in a matter of minutes. Then came the gumbo ya-ya. It was spicy and savory and everything I expected from a gumbo. Finally came the bbq shrimp. We had been warned that these shrimp did come with their heads and tails on. Bibs were placed around our necks and we were off. The shrimp were some of the most rich and delicious ones I have ever tasted. The sauce they were served with was divine. Although it was messy, there is no other dish on the menu I would have traded for this.Overall, service was friendly and quick at Mr. B's. The food was delicious, although a little pricey. Definitely try the brunch if you are able to.",2
3,"I am seriously going to ban myself from eating boiled crab from here on out. It's just so bland but not as bad as eating snow crab claws at seafood buffets. That literally makes me sick.$23 for the 3 pound crab special that came with clam chowder and a caesar salad. It was the tiniest 1.5 crabs ever. The first crab just had larger claws and a tiny body which means I pretty much paid for 2 huge crab claws. Barely any meat in the body. Second crab was the same thing just cut in half. But whatever meat I did have, it was fresh. I'll give that to them.Kind of disappointed after this so I went home and fried up my own 3 marinated crabs at $3.99 per pound. Totally made up for it.",1
5,"Jim @JG is awesome. We knew the transmission on my pickup was going. He fervently tried to keep it going before the inevitable blow-up. Well, the trans rebuild has been solid. It will never blow up again thanks to an external trans cooler. You get what you pay for. This thing has been dynamite, maybe 5 years now. He has also serviced my transfer case, U-joints, and hubs. He will not do unnecessary repairs. I highly recommend his shoppe.",2
5,I got the shrimp and grits!! Omg so amazing!! I was so full and yet I couldn't stop eating. The service was great and the ambiance was chill. Cute place I definitely recommend for brunch :),2
4,"Stopped here while staying at the nearby Omni Hotel downtown Nashville, and not wanting to eat at the hotel, we decided to give this place a try since it is within walking distance from our hotel. It was opened 4 months ago, according to our waitress. We had breakfast at this 24/7 diner. My husband had a quad combo of a huge moist pancake, perfectly done 4 strips of bacon, cook to order eggs (he chose egg white) and scrumptious potato fries. Loved it, and the portion was generous. I ordered the lox and bagel. This was just OK. It did not come with eggs or onion as expected. The smoked salmon was on the skimpy side for this order. I did like the endless strong coffee!",2
4,"I ventured over to K&T Deli to try one of their Banh Mi sandwiches.This place is clean and cute, decorated sparcely.I tried the grilled pork Banh Mi sandwich. I am a Banh Mi addict so I take these sandwiches seriously.For K&T everything was spot on EXCEPT for the bread. The bread was OK but nt the best. It tasted as if it was baked fresh then frozen. Banh Mi should have a crusty french style baugette and this was more of something you would fine for a haogie at Sams Club.Noticed alot of the other patron chowing down on their Pho and other soups and they looked and smelledpretty awesome...gonna have to try those next.",2
5,"I am an Italian southern girl who grew up on Italian creole food, thus, finding great Spanish food has been hard for me.  This restaurant has the best authentic Mexican/Spanish food in the greater New Orleans area.  The food is cooked fresh in an open kitchen that smells so good it will have your stomach growling.  The menu used to be written in Spanish however, they switched to pictures and an English menu which has only allowed me to explore Spanish cuisine further.  My husband and I are addicted to the horchata drinks.  He loves the fajitas, I love their enchiladas.  I chose a red sauce over my enchiladas instead of green which the hostess explained the green sauce was hotter but I found the red sauce to be spicy to perfection.   We placed our order to go because we love to eat at home, however they have a huge dining area and flat screen t.v. with soccer playing last time we went.  If your looking for real, authentic Mexican/Spanish cuisine then I recommend this restaurant.",2
3,"Good food, though I felt like the portions were smaller than I was expecting for the price. I'm surprised that other Yelper's rated this two dollar signs. I also wish they'd had gluten free soy sauce. Other than that, there is really nothing to complain about and I still was able to enjoy my meal.",1
4,"I'd driven by this nursery so many times but only decided to go today because I am planning to collect succulents, and searches for nurseries which sell succulents always resulted with this one being one of the top choices. They have an ok choice of succulents. Service was pretty ok as well and they were as helpful as they could be when there were several customers in the store. I'll visit again for succulents when I need them.",2
5,We had a great meal after a day at the beach. The chicken tacos were great and my husband and so loved crab legs and oysters.,2

5,"Great bar off the lobby of the International Hotel in the CBD, a block off Canal St. We met a friend for drinks and we all had a variant of a Kir Royale made with Cava and a raspberry liqueur from St. George's Spirits in Alameda that was gorgeous. Service was friendly and prompt, and we enjoyed ourselves so much that we went back the next night to do it all over again.",2
4,"A po-boy is simple. French bread, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, the stuffings and hot sauce. Don't expect anything more extravagant than that!Even though you may be turned off from the combination of ingredients, you have to try it all together. It fits like puzzle pieces!The crawfish po-boy here was beautiful. I loved it! It was simple, balanced and best of all, brimming with lightly fried crawfish.I also recommend the alligator steak pieces. Actually, I'm not really sure what they were called, but it's Alligator something and it was AMAZING. I will probably pine away before I can get my hands on those succulent bites again, since it's not often you find them in MD or VA.Anyways, I digress.Good stuff.",2

1,"Please do not bring your loved one to this hospital, they use their patients as guinea pigs and staff have little regard for the privacy and dignity of patients even if they require critical care! My auntie is struggling to stay alive and when my mom stayed with her just two days ago mom had to stand in the room with her the entire time because there were no chairs. When she asked the nurse for a chair the nurse rudely responded that they couldn't accomodate everyone in the hospital. We are looking into transferring my auntie out of this terrible place.",0
4,"Good food court but not very big. some nice stores, but nothing wonderful. But their is a blooming dales outlet there. The stores is broken down by designers and it makes easy to look for things. Getting a good label on sale is always a good thing.",2
1,"This place is a horror show.You're on camera 100% of the time, which they remind you of constantly by putting the CCTV screens in your face just like a check-cashing place. You may be watched the entire time you're there, but not a single person in an orange apron is going to ask if you need anything. They're content to willfully ignore most customers as they chat amongst themselves at the ends of the aisles.I tried to pay for my $200+ worth of bits and drivers, sockets and keys, which took me over an hour to get together because I was never asked if I needed help and when I finally asked, he didn't have a clue what I was talking about. I tried to use the self checkout; the attendant canceled my order twice after I'd checked about half of the little bits. Extenders. Sockets. LOTS of little items. When she told me to start again for the THIRD time, I walked out.Never again.",0
5,"We had lunch at the Brewer's Cabinet which was great, but then we needed some coffee after our long lunch so we asked our bartender and she directed us to the nearby Coffeebar. She told me about the Lavender Latte which I thought sounded interesting, so I tried one on ice and it was so good! I love the vibe of the place too. Very beautiful and great service. Can't wait to go back!!!",2
4,"I've been to Hot Diggity twice: once the week it opened, and today, to bring my friends.  I like hot dogs, but I'm a vegetarian; which is why I'm a fan of this place - they have 2 dog options: meat and non-meat.  Then you get to choose from 10 different regional styles of condiment ""packages"" to add to your dog.  The first time, I had the Fiesta (guacamole, lettuce, tomato, topped with sour cream) - yummm.  Today, I had the Windy City (pickle, relish, onions, and mustard) - again yummm.  I've always been a fan of the Chicago-style dog, however, so this was no surprise.  They also sell hand-cut fries (which I find are a tad bit overly salted) that you can purchase additional dips for, like Peppercorn Ranch, Rosemary Aioli, or Chimichurri Sauce.  The ranch was decent, but the rosemary aioli was a bit bland, and the chimichurri sauce was not true chimichurri sauce, but more like a chimichurri sauce + salt and mayo - lime.  I am not mad about the dips, though - after all, they were only 25 cents each, and I like trying things.  I just won't buy the same ones anymore.I like this place to come back again and again to keep trying all the different varieties.  Next on my list: the Bronx (with sauerkraut!!!) and the Saigon Fusion (with pickled carrots and cucs!!!).  If only I had a faster metabolism, I would've tried them all already.",2
4,Hoe excited was i to find a gluten free vegan pizza (up charge) option.Staff was super accommodating and courteous.When ordering gluten free it is common to be asked Allergy or Preferance. But when i get down the line to add my toppings they actually switched gloves to prevent cross contamination which I have never seen before. So thought full :)The price is pretty good for a personal pizza in this area. The crusts are my favorite and are thin and nicely cooked. Lots of choices for toppings :),2
4,"Had an overall great experience at The Saint Hotel during a three night stay.  The hotel is conveniently located on Canal Street and just a short walk away from the French Quarter and the Central Business District.Didn't have any complaints about the noise level even though our room faced Canal Street.  The higher the floor the better I imagine if you're particularly sensitive to noise.The rooms were comfortable, clean and newly renovated.  I didn't have a chance to check out the bar and restaurant as there was a filming happening in the lobby and well, there's so many places to go out in New Orleans, but they looked very cool.The free wifi was awesome and exactly how it should be - free.Only ding was that there was no hand soap in our room upon arrival and the coffee pods were not refilled each day.I would recommend a stay here.",2

5,Yum.  Consistently excellent. The daily menu items are a great value and fun. I could eat here every day. But.....I could not fit through the revolving door.....,2
3,"If you work at AB, this place is pretty much your go-to lunch spot. Friendly staff and always a solid sandwich. Quick service, but they make both the hot and cold sandwiches with a little extra love and care. The mesquite turkey and the ""St. Louisan"" are my two personal favorites. Some outdoor seating or you can always head across the street to the park for an impromptu picnic.",1
5,Best Salty Caramel I have ever had & you know I love you Jeni! Your shits still splendid but boys in NOLA got you here.,2
1,"The Customer service I have ever experienced dining out.  We called on Friday for a 7;00 reservation for Sat.  we arrived 15 minutes earlier and waited over an hour, then walked out after seeing others walking in and seated.   the manager was as ignorant as can be.  we watched the hostess as she gave wrong instructions to the servers.  This was supposed to be a birthday dinner that was a disaster NEVER GO THERE AGAIN.   This used to be our favorite place,  not now o",0

5,"If you dream of the perfectly romantic location providing the upper echelon in pastries and baked goods, there's no need to hold out for your dream trip to Paris, just make your way to The Cake Bake Shop.  The beautifully landscaped garden and flower boxes are just a tease of what you'll see inside, with every detail taken into consideration enticing your eyes to wander throughout the store.  I was on a mission to get a cake for my boss and was able to scored the award winning Earl's Chocolate cake.  I enjoyed a mimosa and scone as I waited, and was thrilled when it was brought out.  The presentation was as exquisite as the cake itself, complete with a signature box tied up in ribbon.  I took a menu to share with my group, and magically served the 8"" cake to the masses (usually serves 8-10) once I made the grand entrance.   I must admit, I've never spent that much on a cake that size, but the raves that were received and interest in where it came from were proof enough (if not the crumbs in the box) to affirm my decision was a stellar one.  My boss also mentioned he'd never had a cake as delicious!  I'll be sure to bring this up when it's time for my review.",2
5,"I must say after 20 minutes of aimlessly driving in Delran, we finally stumbled across this hidden gem. My husband and I were greeted with such friendly faces, which set the tone for the night. We told them it was our anniversary and they were more than welcome to accommodate. They gave us a nice secluded table on the beach with lit candles, it was just what we wanted. Our server was very prompt and sweet. She was more than willing to go over the menu and explain the specials in more lament terms. My husband had the Grilled ribeye and I had the Salmon. Everything was grilled to perfection with just the right accompaniments. But the cherry on top the night, of course, was dessert. I was sold as soon as our server brought over the dessert tray. We had the carrot cake and sugar free cheesecake. THE CARROT CAKE WAS UNBELIEVABLY MOIST AND DELICIOUS! The cheesecake was so creamy, you didn't even miss the sugar. I will definitely be making Foyster's Dockside a regular spot for us.",2
5,"Love this place! Best Kee Mao in town! Get it ""native thai hot"" (if you can handle it). They pretty much have great everything though. I would also recommend the red or green curry. It will literally light your a** on fire. If you are a fan of the ""hot and spicy"" like I am, then get the waitstaff to bring you a small bowl of peppers with fish sauce. If your food is not spicy enough, then adding some of those peppers will change that in a hurry. The place looks completely ghetto on the outside but it actually has a pretty decent interior. So I would say it's a nice quiet atmosphere on the inside. A good place to take a date.Also, I must say the prices are quite reasonable, and the service is always excellent.",2
4,"I love this place, friendly staff, the food is good, service was quick whenever I was here and the cooks are pretty funny....can be a bit pricy though.",2
3,Dots Diner is like coming home.  Friendly and attentive staff along with very good Diner food.   I've had breakfast here several days while working and they have exceeded my expectations every day.  Whether your here on pleasure or work there is no better place to start your day than Dots Diner. Truth in dining leads me to report a less than favorable experience after a string of very good ones.  This morning I arrived at 5:30 am as usual and to be honest it was not the same staff that I had seen for the previous two weeks. After sitting in acknowledged for seven minutes I left and drove up the street where I had a fantastic experience.  It's good to be great but there is something to be said for consistency too.  I won't let one underwhelming experience get me too down on Dots.,1
2,"Traveler's Rest is an old mansion located deep inside a residential area near the Franklin Pike. It is small, in contemporary view quite plebeian for a plantation house, and is hard to find.  There's an exhibit on the original owner of the house, John Overton, a friend of Andrew Jackson and influential Tennessean in his own right, as well as some exhibits on the Battle of Nashville, which occurried right off the property.  It's decently expensive at $10 and difficult to find, and unless you are a Civil War buff, its not really worth the effort  (to those that are interested in the Civil War, there are much more interesting sites down in Franklin).",0
4,"Me and my girlfriend are considering making this our regular spot.Pros.The ramen is great! The wings everyone is talking about are so delicious. I'm hoping to try everything on the menu. It's cute no seriously the only way I can describe this noodle bar is cute its like if a bunch of american teens got together and opened a noodle shop cute. I like that I can also watched the chefs make the food if I am at the bar it makes the experience a bit more interactive, I know I'm reaching but it's honestly like watching the cooking channel and them handing the food to you when its done.  The drinks are daring and cool looking, okay im not much of a drinker in fact I prefer for my drinks to taste like anything but alcohol but still they are great to look at. Cons.It's a little tight. But in today's economy most new restaurants are and I'm here for that. So leave more good reviews and hopefully in enough time they get a bigger spot.This is more of an unpopular request but maybe a sake lemonade or sangria for us sweet cocktail lovers or a sweet cider on the beer menu. It's a little pricey for ramen I say that only because I realize that I pay so much because I need an appetizer with it or I won't be full. I always leave wanting more food.",2
5,Love this place! Great Staff and amazing food. A different lunch special everyday! Today's is homemade meatloaf:),2
5,"Enjoyed my shrimp lo mein, egg drop soup, and egg roll.  Prices are reasonable and delivery was fast.",2
5,"I've had good experiences and bad experiences at Pep Boys. Today was one of those great experiences. I stopped in to see if they could change my headlight bulbs. The gentleman who greeted me, in the most friendly way, came right out to look at the car. He said he could take care of it right away. It took about 10 minutes for him to complete the task. During it all he was funny, friendly, and so nice. I did not get his name but he said he is the manager. After he finished I went inside to pay and he waived me off. He said no charge! Wow! What a great experience!",2
4,"I think the coffee is great and the food is yummy. The iced coffee is delicious and I also enjoy their homemade syrups (caramel is AWESOME). My fav snack they have their is the avocado toast with a poached egg on top. SO GOOD. I find their coffee and food can be a bit expensive but the quality is good so I don't want to complain too much. Since Buddy Brew is such a Tampa institution, the shop can get kind of crowded which is what demotes it to 4 stars for me. I'm glad their business is doing well, but I like a quieter coffee shop vibe. Definitely a place to stop by if you haven't been before!",2
2,Very slow service for a very simple order. Food quality was average compared to other KFCs.,0
5,"A happy and satisfying out-of-the-blue discovery today. That's an understatement...more like ""Blown away!"" Biggest, tastiest (and not greasy, at all) deluxe gyro I've had in St Louis, and I've been eating gyros for nearly 30 years...p.s. The orzo salad was a gem too :)",2
5,"If you have the chance, eat here! Food is fresh and so tasty. Amazing service. I have never done a review on yelp before. May not again but loved this place so much I felt compelled to share.",2
5,"Great little local breakfast joint with an amazing buffet!  Perfect for a post-church meal.  The crabmeat omelette was on point, and so were the potatoes and chicken.",2
3,"It pains me to give this review because we've had a lot of good meals here in the past but our last two dinners here had identical problems.We went here for dinner last night. It was pretty busy for a Tuesday night so we expected a little bit of a wait for our meal. But the wait was compounded by service issues.We ordered the Vietnamese Pancake for an appetizer and Pho and Vermicelli for our entrees. Our order was taken pretty promptly but it took over a half hour for our pancake to be served. A party who arrived after us got their appetizer about ten minutes before us.It took another twenty minutes to get my vermicelli but Baby's pho was nowhere to be found nor did our server (the older gentleman) offer an explanation or apology. We waited a minute or two but when the pho still didn't come, I flagged down the other (young) server who said he would check into it. He came back apologetically alluding to some issue and promised it would come soon.Finally, about five minutes later, our original server delivered the pho without a word nor any acknowledgement of a problem. This is the same guy who at our last dinner forgot to place part of our order and then double charged us. It seems we're not the only ones whose order he screwed up. As we were taking care of our bill, we heard the party behind us pointing out that something was missing from their take-out order.The owner used to be here frequently but we haven't seen him in quite some time so I'm wondering if in his absence he's taken his eyes off the ball leading to the slippage in service.We really want to continue supporting Oriental Pearl so I'm hoping that they  take steps to get back on track.",1
3,"Setting: awesome. Very chill, tiki atmosphere on the back patio. A propane fire pit and amble seatingFood: as Rachel Ray would say, ""delish!"" Drinks: great flavor, not overly sweet. Very reasonable prices. Service: Here's the downfall. Our server was really nice. I've had her on two separate visits. On my last visit I asked for water when she came and greeted me after I had been sitting for a few minutes. 15 mins later she returned and I asked for water again and a beer. 30 mins into the visit she came with my beer and water. I gulped the water down because it was in the 80's and it took about another 20mins to get a refill. After my group had joined me at the table earlier in the evening, it took about 10-15mins for our server to come over and take their drink order. I was disapointed in the wait times because I did not feel like she was engaged in managing her tables and we would sit with empty drinks while she spoke with her co workers at the bar here and there. I will likely return because I like the food, and atmosphere so much. However, I'll have to choose when to visit wisely because it will likely be a lengthy process to order based on the speed of service in the past.",1
5,I love this place! Their staff are very knowledgable and their readers are fabulous! The stone and jewelry selections are out of this world!,2
5,This is simply great Japanese restaurant. Great foods and service. It is surprisingly clean and spotless. I had one of the best Ramen here. I definitely will come back next time I visit Philadelphia.,2
4,"the experience here trumps it all. we celebrated our daughter's birthday on a tuesday evening and were the only people there for a while. the owner/waiter/server was fantastic in explaining the process which really impressed us. $5 cocktails and our 6-course dinner for 3, including soda, 2 cocktails and tea topped the bill at just $100 and that's including the tip. yes, it is everything that everyone raves about.why not 5 stars? well...the food was good, but not like great.we will definitely go back!",2
4,"Service is great, food is delicious - but overpriced.  The ceasar salad - there is something w/ the dressing it will have you on the potty.  Not kidding, everyone from my firm has had the same experience.  Its delicious - but all the same will give you a cleasing.",2
5,"This is definitely the best breakfast place in Philly. İf you bored for classic breakfast routine you should definitely come and visit this place for unique taste super fast service, delicious coffee and friendly environment. Highly recommend it for this place for breakfast lunch or brunch. It's not like a regular classic American breakfast. It's a little expensive but it's worth every penny. Come on in and enjoy middle eastern hospitality.",2
5,"Lovely little flower shop with great staff. Stopped in for a couple arrangements for a wedding shower, nothing pre-made but said they could put something together quickly. Within 10 minuted had 2 of these lovely arrangements. They did a great job and were affordable. Highly recommend this cute shop!",2
5,"Get the bacon. Get the coffee. Get the pancakes. Get everything. (Get your wallet ready too cuz it's not cheap).Milktooth fulfills all your hipster brunch dreams - from the tatted chefs to the cool-clothed waiters to the converetrd garage dining area. It seems like a pretty exclusive team. However, once you order and wait (for a bit despite the slow Tuesday afternoon), the taste is so worth it. My table got the berry pancakes, the savory pancakes, and the grilled cheese with truffles. I also got the bacon, which came out in thick fat slices. Its probably the best bacon I ever had. The mango smoothie rivaled a mango lassi, and everything was really delicious. uffle oil with aged cheddar grilled cheese. The grill cheese had the perfect savory combo of sweet n salty topped with an egg cooked just right. You can't get more flavorful than this I definitely think this is one of those restaurants that everyone should visit!",2
4,"Service in bar can be slow on the weekends so if you are in a rush, ask to sit in the dining room.  Everything gluten free is AMAZING!!! (Especially the BBQ chicken pizza).  The salads are also awesome!",2
5,"Here's a moving tip for you: Don't buy moving boxes. It's an unnecessary expense when so many places will give them to you for free. Produce stands and farmers markets are my favorite places. Just ask nicely, and they'll give you as many as you want. Another plus? They're super sturdy!Anyway, this review is about Uhaul. I stopped by the grab some bubble wrap and packing tape for my move. The associates were super friendly and helpful, and the prices seemed fair. If you'd rather buy your boxes, they have a nice variety here, with plenty of sizes. And they buy back any unused boxes, which is kind of neat.",2
2,"Average American food with deluded aspirations.Yeah, I didn't hate it but I really do not care for eating at a restaurant and thinking, ""Yeah, I can do this better at home."" (With a blindfold and 1 hand tied behind my back. Ok, maybe not but still)I had the ""chicken"" enchiladas. Didn't hate them or love them and they come covered in sour cream which is not stated on the menu. So I ended up scraping off more than half the sauce while trying to get rid of the weird white stuff on my food. The beans were good but I have a feeling most people would say they were under seasoned and under salted. The rice was not good. It was dry and boring.The bf had the buffalo burger. I didn't try it, as I do not eat buffalo. He said it was seasoned ""different"". The service was fine. Not stellar but not horrid.The beer was fantastic, lol, which made the dinner better.I would only eat here again if someone else wanted to.",0
4,"Very fast service, good food, and a fun/kitschy Mexican restaurant atmosphere. This is the kind of place I go to when I'm craving regular, good, fast Mexican food.",2
2,"Food- C+Beer- B-Atmosphere- CService- BWent to Urban Village per request from a member of my group of friends to check it out after a month of their opening. It is pretty clear that they are still getting over a learning curve. We were seated outside and our waiter, while very polite, was overall not attentive and not knowledgeable of the menu. He was helpful with the beer selection though, so a plus there. In addition the lighting outside on the porch was just pitiful going into the sunset. You can't see anyone. Aim for a spot inside the restaurant if you are arriving at night. Great bathrooms though, very clean.We all ordered some variant of the pizza just to try them all out. Out of 7 pies that we ordered, I really only liked 1, maybe two of them and even so, they were mostly dough and barely any cheese or toppings on them. For the price tag of around $12-14 a pie, that was really disappointing. Maybe the other food is better, but I cannot comment on that and only through my experience.The beer itself was good, but I've had better from other brewpubs in the city at cheaper prices as well. Most of the beers are pretty entry-level if you are a craft beer lover, so nothing exciting.Overall it was nice to try out the place, I don't go to NoLibs often so it is a welcome addition to the neighborhood, but I don't think I will be returning for the food, maybe for 1-2 beers if I am getting ready to go out somewhere. However if it is too crowded I will be looking elsewhere as it is not worth any wait.",0
3,"Is a great place to get a great organic smoothie, BUT my last time I was there they had music playing that had a lot of f bombs in it. Sadly as a father of young children, I will not be returning there.",1
2,"High hopes based on some of the previous reviews, but we were disappointed. Bad first impression, we were seated right away but were onlygiven one menu for four of us. No server greet after 10 minutes, we had to waive someone in to take a drink order and get more menus. Had the ""red wings"" as a starter, underwhelming Sysco-type frozen wings. Spaghetti entree was meh with a bland Raghu Old world style sauce. Fish & Chips, fish was cooked well but three really small pieces. Chicken sandwich was also meh, just bland. Not poor food, just very blah. Lacking flavor... too many amazing choices in Dunedin to come with just so-so dishes.",0
5,I am thoroughly impressed with Diva! The whole group of salon professionals are very good- starting with Tina!They will bend over backwards to make you happy and fit you in as they are always busy! Prices are good!,2
3,"I wouldn't say this place is anything special or anything. Just your typical Papa Johns. If you're looking for a quick, relatively cheap place to grab a pizza, it's a good place for it. I have a feeling they have the business they have because of the business's close proximity to West Chester student housing.",1
5,"Mike's ice cream is the best, great flavors to chose from.  They moved off Broadway,  but worth it, more room.",2
4,"No complaints here. Mom and Pops style diner with good traditional breakfast. Restaurant was small so was worried it would be busy but was pretty dead when we walked in. The service was quick and the food came out hot and fast. I orderd the farmers omlet which had ham, bacon, sausage, and potatoes. It also came with a large portion hash browns that were just as good! I would definitely recommend this late night breakfast joint!",2
4,"Mo has been cutting my hair since he opened his Barber Shop. He does a great job with my cut and his Barber Shop is very clean and classy. It's taken him a while, but over the past couple of years, he has really transformed the place into a very handsome shop. My cut costs $15 and it's a fantastic deal considering that you would normally pay double that price at half the shop! Certain times of the day, they can get very busy but it's worth the wait if you can't make it during a slower time of day.",2
5,"First time visit the other day, amazing!!!! Best hot chicken anywhere!!! Will def be a must stop every time we come to Nashville!!!",2
5,"This is probably the best restaurant I have ever eatin at that was inside a Holiday Inn, and actually one of the better ones I have been to period. I would normally give it 4 stars, but considering where it is, I think it deserves an extra star. Normally, holiday Inn restaurants are terrible places, and I avoid them, but it was late, and we were exhausted, so we gave it a chance. Bossman got the porkchop that was about 4 inches thick (no kidding) and I got the bourbon chicken. Both were excellent, and the pork wasn't tough, which was surprising Considering how big those chops were. A few things about Alton:East Alton is a rusty old industry town, a place in its hay day made some awesome stuff. They still have Winchester making ammunition their and Olin Brass cranking out precision copper and brass alloys. unfortunately, my reason to go  there was to decommission some research equipment at the olin Brass Metals research Lab. Yeah, the bean counters shut down the research department. Stupid. I wonder what the heck is going to keep this country going in the future. Also, Alton was home to the worlds tallest man.",2
3,"We stopped by here around 2:00 pm on Saturday and the place was hoppin!  We were promptly seated, so I had a few minutes to look over the place before we ordered the food.Ambiance:  I have stated before in my reviews that I absolutely loathe it when restaurants rely on big screen TVs for entertaining.  They assume that the majority of people really give a crap about sports.  I don't and I find it really distracting.  The Cheese in Cheeseburger must really mean CHEEEESY DECOR.  Seriously, fake hula skirts on the wait staff?  FOOD:  I almost didn't want to come here because I remember people saying they charged you for soda refills.  We were not, so they must have changed their policy.  I had the pulled pork sliders.  The meat itself was pretty good, but I didn't like that the bottom of the sandwich was soggy because of the cole slaw.  We also ordered onion rings as an appetizer which were excellent.Overall, I'm glad I came, but neither the food or ambiance did anything to scream ""Come back, Allie!""",1
5,"Amazing!!! If you like burgers you need to visit this place. The Hot Mamasita is also an excellent tequila using jalapeño infused tequila. The truffle fries were rather greasy...I opted for spinach, safer and healthier!",2
5,"Ribeye was amazing!!!   60 day dry aged. One of the best I've ever had!!! Shrimp cocktail was good, but I don't understand all the love? Service was great! Bacon was kick ass! I liked the whole experience!! So did the whole family!",2
2,"This is why millennials are broke. $16 for a smoothie and it's always so busy that you have to wait 25 minutes to even get your food. I'd rather save my money and eat healthy at home. A fun outing for a special treat, but I don't know who in their right mind would be a regular here.",0
4,"I love a good burger, so I had to try this place out.  The location is great, and it wasn't crowded at all on the Sunday evening that I came. The service was great and the food was good as well. Great burger, still not as good as the Pharmacy in my eyes but that is hard to beat. The milkshakes were excellent.  I had the Smores shake.",2
5,"They have a drive through! Super convenient for my quick stop to bring some beignets back to Houston. Order came out hot & fresh pretty quickly. I got the powdered sugar in a separate bag so it wouldn't melt and wow they're not stingy! I had so much powdered sugar my little brother double dipped/tripled dip drowning out each bite. My family loved it, thumbs up! Frozen coffee gave me enough energy for my long drive back to Houston and kept cold for hours!",2
4,"This place is seriously hit or miss. The last time I was there the bbq was really under-par, the ribs were really tough, the sausage was mediocre at best, and the potatoe salad was just plain gross. Thankfully - that's what was on my boyfriend's plate, not mine. The enchiladas on the other hand were amazing as always. I wish I could buy the enchilada sauce so I could put it on everything, plus the fried egg on top (which I first thought was a very odd addition) is cooked to perfection with a beautifully running yoke. Although I still think it's a little annoying that if you order them with a meat it comes on the plate almost like a side, the dish is still my favorite.Plus the happy hour is pretty on point - half off on margarita pitchers that aren't scrimping on the booze, sounds good to me.",2
5,Great food and service. The antipasto was by far the best that I have ever had.  The pasta is all fresh and full of flavor. The Fisherman's stew was loaded with great tender fish in a saffron sauce.,2
5,We stopped here off a recommendation. The breakfast was really incredible and the juice was so fresh. I would definitely give this place a shot if you're in the area!,2
5,"Since I work in University City, I decided today after work to treat myself to a manicure, since I hadn't gotten one in at least 2 years.  Mind you, since I play guitar and do makeup/paint faces, I have to keep my nails short, but every once in a while, or in this case, once every few years, I like to indulge in that simple pleasure that is a manicure.  Since I am contemplating getting my cosmetology license in the next few years and had never taken advantage of a student clinic before, I decided to give it a shot with a manicure on the first visit rather than a haircut or color so I wouldn't take any risk leaving with a hairstyle I was not expecting to walk out with, had that been the case.  Milan was the student who did my nails, and even though she seemed a bit shy at first, she was very friendly, made conversation with me, and more importantly, she probably did a better job than many professional licensed manicurists have done on my nails.  Even though it is a cosmetology school, it has the vibe of a real salon with cool decor and friendly reception staff to boot, and since it is an Aveda school, it smells great too!  First time clients also get some free samples as well as a comment card which doubles as a 10% off coupon for your next visit!  I will definitely keep the Aveda Institute in mind for future services!",2
5,"The weather outside is horrible so I didn't want to go too far for food so I decided to stop into Carmelita's Mexican Restaurant and I am pleased to say that I was not at all disappointed.The chips and salsa that come when you sit down were pretty awesome!  the salsa had substance to it and a nice sweet and spicy flavor.  I prefer salsa that has some substance where others prefer salsa that really just a red hot sauce with no substance, to each their own I say but theirs was nice and chunky.I had the Enchiladas Verde with 2 sides of beans and it was awesome, great flavor on the seasoned chicken mixed well with the Verde and sour cream.  The re-fried beans are the best I have had since I left California.  I was very impressed with my meal here.The prices here were pretty cheap, less than $10 per person and I left full.  When it comes to Mexican food though everyone seems to have a variation of what a decent price is.  I do to, I don't believe that Tacos should be more than $1 each but that's just me, I grew up eating at Taco stands in California.  But for a more in depth meal I'll pay more.The also sell tamales by the dozen here is you wanted some.I'll definitely be coming back.",2
5,"Chips and blue cheese not so good. The rest of the apps we had were dynamite.  Clean oysters, mussels were amazing (ask for bread). Everyone loved the lamb, fish and chips, and the salmon.Wait staff was very attentive, but not over the top in your face.Love, love, love the new addition to DoylestownWelcome to good food Doylestown and enjoy!",2
5,"The service here is just incredible. I was always a little shy asking what whiskies to try.....its a whiskey bar filled with whiskey fans. I didnt be made fun of!But nope. The bartender, Scott I believe his name was, told me about the flights. He said if I was a newbie, the flights wouldnt be that great for me and made me a custom flight. And it was perfect. I now know exactly what to get and what style I like. Scott was also there any time my glass was empty....even when the bar got packed, he was on top of ever drink order with the quickness. Oh, and get food. Anything you get here is awesome.",2
4,"The simple fact that i caught a hotdog (in the upper deck) shot out of the Hotdog-Cannon merits a four star review for this joint in its own right... Unfortunately though, having the Hotdog-Gods smile upon me in such a way just leaves everything else about this park seem inconsequential in comparison....The straight rundown on citizens bank is that it fancies itself a family oriented establishment. Children with giant pretzels runnin' n' a screamin' down the aisles, whole families laughin' n' dancin' and cheerin' while eating icecreams out of mini baseball helmets, all while thoroughly embracing themselves in one gigantic smiling disaster.  Hooray!Personally, im used to and feel far more comfortable in an atmosphere more to the likes of Shea or the Bronx where old grizzled men from Queens stamp out their half smoked cigars on newborn babies all while drinking the blood of sacrificed kittens and puppies, howling rabid obscenities, and slugging back pints of canadian club whiskey they snuck in via duct taping the bottle to their inner thigh in the parking lot.       ....oh well.       Either way, raising a cannon propelled hotdog to the skies in screaming triumph and tasting its deliciousness soon after will bring  a drunken smile to my face in any ballpark. Citizens-Bank-Park-DaycareCenter-Hotdog-Paradise forever and ever.",2
4,"I ordered a supreme pizza , and chicken Caesar wrap. It was delicious, full of flavor. My only issue is the soggy end of the pizza , but I still ate it! Delivery took expected time (30-40 mins). I'll definitely continue to order on weekends.",2

5,"Great place for all types of pet supplies, including costumes!",2
1,Worst Italian restraint I ever been to. Took 15 minutes for someone to wait on us and she walked by us 4 times. No personality. The food was Luke warm and old or burnt was the worse I ever had.,0
3,"This hotel was ok for an overnight stay.  It was decorated nicely for the Christmas holiday.  Upon arrival into the lobby, it smelled delightful as one walked in, a very clean smelling and neat, well-kept appearance for an older hotel.  The room was an ok size but the beds were a bit tight.  It just seemed like they were full size beds and not queens.  Also the bathroom vanity seemed a tad bit oversized for the space.  It felt cramped while using the bathroom.  There isn't much room to move around in the bathroom, and with the vanity and the door in close proximity it would make one feel claustrophobic.  Other than that it was nice.  The staff brought extra towels and washcloths upon request, and the front desk followed up by telephone to make sure housekeeping brought them.  That was refreshing.  Overall it was a pleasant stay.",1
2,"We went here for lunch not long ago and were not at all impressed with the food. The environment and service was fine, and the location is good, but the food itself was (1) very small portioned for the price and (2) not great quality. We got ravioli for our kids and it was so dry that it was barely edible. We will not be going back.",0
4,"Cute little motel located in a easy walk to the beach location of Santa Barbara.  Although the room was small, it was well appointed and newly upgraded featuring nice decor and bathroom amenities.   They also offer a small continental coffee that included tasty coffee, juices and muffins.Perfect for a quick, romantic getaway!",2
3,"We just had dinner at this Greek restaurant that is A 10 minute walk from the art museum. We were seated in the back room that was really cute and the waitress was nice. I ordered the lamb shrank with vegetables and my husband roasted lamb with vegetables and potatoes. The lamb shank was very good, the roasted lamb was good. The mixed vegetables was a gray mash of peas cabbage and carrots cooked to death and they were just warm not hot. They tasted OK but look terrible. The waitress said that was how the vegetables were prepared. The food seem to be just dump together on a plate and didn't look very appetizing. We also split a Greek salad which for some strange reason didn't have any greens but the cucumbers and tomatoes and olives were tasty. I will try this place again and order something different.",1
4,"We've had mostly great experiences in the past here, but we went again recently and were pretty disappointed.  The waitress was aloof, slow, and not friendly at all.  When we looked at our menus, we realized they had significantly raised their prices since the last time (probably by 20-25% on the entrees).  We were unadventurous and both order the salmon with mustard butter sauce, which we've both really enjoyed in the past.  Unfortunately, my salmon was a little undercooked and my wife remarked that the salmon quality was not as good as before.  The sauce was definitely off as well--overly salty and not much of the good ground mustard flavor (I think they just went heavy on the salted butter).  The food was disappointing, especially since we were paying 20-25% more than the time before.",2
3,"I really wish lucky goat would carry skim milk. On several occasions they have either not had it, or worse handed it to me and then I realized that the expiry date had passed. I can imagine that I am not the only person that doesn't like whole milk or cream in my coffee. It just seems to me like skim milk should be a staple at a coffee house and it isn't here. Other than that, the service is always friendly and they have a nice assortment of fresh pastries. It is for sure a welcome addition to the neighborhood.....if management reads these reviews....please consider having fresh skim milk.",1
4,"Swung by here while I was in town and was so happy I did. Great atmosphere, great staff and delicious food. The warm tortilla chips and salsa were quite tasty. I recommend the fish tacos.",2
5,"I live closer to another restaurant but always find the food here exceptional. I had a large order, it was timely and hot. The lady and young man behind the counter were friendly . There are full orders. A large order is plenty for 4. We also enjoyed the sweet treats after dinner . Could not have asked for better. Well worth the drive.",2
5,"I have to admit that this place is a great place for KBBQ. Since there are some slim pickings around this area, this place takes the cake. I didn't wait very long for a table. The staff were very courteous and explained how the menu worked as well as how to best grill the different meats. I also really like how the hoods are part of the grilling area so there's not this bulky hood on top of each table. The sides are very good as well and there's a wide variety of sides there. Can't wait to come back to get my KBBQ fix",2
1,"Just had a ""ramen"" delivered... All I'm going to say is, you're better off eating the instant ramen soup! First time I tried this place and I'm sure it will be the last.",0
3,"Most the food here is great, we always have issues getting our steaks cooked properly even going by their steak chart. We order medium-rare and it comes out raw so we send it back then it comes out well-done. We end up with the manager having to go back and make sure the cooks are paying attention and then it seems to come out the way we order it or at least close enough we can eat it. The appetizers are wonderful if you can get them cooked properly. Even the manager was shocked how ours looked. The manager apologize but this is a regular occurrence at this restaurant.",1
3,Breakfast on Sunday was pretty good. Cinnamon muffin was less than fresh. It's close it's cheap so I'll be back,1
4,"El Camino is an awesome bar but not as good as a restaurant.  The food is average, but the great, affordable drinks more than make up for it.  They have an awesome late night happy hour and the $1/person never-ending chips is great for munching and drinking.  As far as Mexican food goes, you can get much better elsewhere in Philly and as far as BBQ food goes, you can also get much better, but neither are horrible here.  My favorite here is the Big Ass Burger.  Salud!",2
4,"I surprised my girl with dinner at Bailey's Range, and she was excited to go!  Being a burger aficionado, I was happy to indulge my girl's burger passion.  At the same time, we were excited because the Range makes everything from scratch -- and I mean everything, right down to homemade buns and homemade sauces.  If they made their own glassware, plates, and silverware, I think they would have taken the experience to a whole new level!  We got there shortly after the Range opened, so seating was not a problem.  Our server took our drink orders.  She had a dark beer, and I had the ""Sweet Sweet Bacon"" -- a milkshake with Maker's Mark, candied bacon, and salted caramel ice cream.  The shake was good -- I think mine might have had a little too much Maker's Mark, knocking the balance of the drink off, but I didn't mind -- it had been a long week up to Thursday...!  We skipped appetizers and went right to mains.  She ordered the American burger, and was more than happy.  Then again, who wouldn't want a fried mac'n cheese patty atop their burger, which was cooked medium rare (appropriately the way she wanted it) on a soft bun (double score for her!).  I ordered the Ahh Jamn!, which was supposed to come with bacon jam, red onions (I had asked for caramelized onions), mushrooms, and cheddar cheese.  When my burger came out, I was ready to kill it, so started enjoying it.  About midway through the experience, it dawned on me -- ""...is this my burger?""  I didn't really get the taste of bacon jam or mushrooms, though it looked like it might have been on there.  The cheese enveloped my burger, so it was hard to tell whether I had the right burger.  But I pressed on anyway, because I was hungry.  We also ordered a large order of fries, and asked for their house mayo and house cheese sauce.  The fries were great, and the homemade sauces were divine.Overall, this was a good experience.  In hindsight, I should have said something to our server regarding my burger, but I chose not to.  That was my bad.  That's the only reason why I give Bailey's 4/5 stars rather than 5/5 stars.  That being said, that only means that I'll be back there again to try something different, because Bailey's Range is worth it!",2
5,"Not really the town you would expect to find a great Indian restaurant, but figured I'd give it a shot.I'm picky about Indian food, and all I can say is WOW it's good!The Naan with peach chutney was amazing.The Lamb Korma was perfect. Perfect amount of spice (too many Indian restaurant set your mouth on fire and you can't enjoy the taste). Not too much, not too little.The rice and lamb was perfectly cooked. Very authentic.The decor is very nice (those chairs in the front are impressive) and staff very friendly. Service was also very quick.I'm relocating to Tampa, and might actually have to make the drive from there a few times to come back. Very impressive!I would definitely recommend this place, even if it's a bit of a drive.  It's worth it.",2
1,"Been here twice now.  Both times I ordered a caesar salad with chicken, and both times it was a bust.  Some of the produce was wilted, browning and bitter, and just doused in dressing beyond anything reasonable.Counter service was so-so.  First time I went in, there were two staff members taking their time.  I was third in line, and it took almost 20 minutes to walk out with my to-go order.  Second time I was in, there was literally no one behind the counter or anywhere in sight for almost 10 minutes.  No bueno, Fresh Bar.  Thanks anyway.",0
5,Brick Tavern is a nice 'happening' place to meet people in the area. I love the outdoor patio. I'm not a huge fan of the food because I eat on the healthier side but I still enjoy going here for the atmosphere.,2
1,"Myron and perma ceram were recommended to me by a contractor/friend.  My tub had some rust and chipping which was explained to Myron when we were scheduling the job.  The price seemed reasonable, so I said okay.  Mike came out a few days later and was a nice guy.  He took a look at the tub and said the repairs would be no problem.  He said he can fix the rust and the tub would look like new. After he was finished and he was paid I was handed a receipt/invoice. Once Mike leaves,  I read what he handed me and at the end it states there is no warranty for rust.  What!  Why wouldn't you say that to me.  I just would have bought a new tub for the price.  Once the tub dried, I could get a closer look and there were several areas it appeared weren't sanded down so there were ridges along several edges.  Not a new tub, so I could live with that.Fast forward, a couple months went bye and what do you know, I could see the rust coming through. So I call Myron to schedule an appointment and after months of run around, I get a call asking if they can come Christmas Eve. Seriously!  Needless to say they finally said they were too busy to come to the city.  Essentially go pound sand.  Beware.",0
5,"I don't know what some of these peoples problems are with this place (other than veiled racism) but taking a wedding dress in to be fitted 7 months out is idiotic, regardless of how secure you are in your sizing.Anyway, I've never had a problem here whatsoever. They aren't all warm and fuzzy, but I'm paying for competence, not smiles, and competent they assuredly are. They got out decade old blood stains out of a ball hockey jersey and have an average turnaround of 2-3 days, even during the holidays and wedding season. I can't recommend them enough. When we move, we will most certainly still be taking our clothes in here for dry cleaning and alterations.",2
1,"It's been 10 years since I've been to a Shoney's, and I'll never eat at a Shoney's again. The people working there are nice and I honestly feel for them. The food was disappointing, though not inedible. The $11.99 buffet is a poor excuse for a buffet, we might have done better to just order something from the menu. I went with my wife and two kids on a Saturday evening and although they didn't appear to be that busy, it took 15 minutes to get a table and another 20 minutes to pay at the counter once we were done eating. I don't really enjoy eating at Waffle House, but I would have had a much better experience at the Waffle House across Briley  I'm sure.",0
2,Old country buffet's Chinese cousin opened up in the same place he left. Vast variety but everything tasted the same. Prime rib over cooked.  Serving utensils greasy and oily. Dessert picked over and decimated.  Bathrooms had water puddles. Debris all over restaurant and bathroom floor.  Will not return.,0
4,"Had the platter! Everything was AMAZING!!! Smoked chicken is hard to perfect, but this was probably the best I've ever had!! Both times I ordered it! Very tasty & not dried out!! Someone has perfected the recipe!!",2
3,"Smith's Bar and Restaurant is well priced and had great service.  We were very pleased with our easier who took no time at all to give us our bill. The menu doesn't have the most unique options, but the food itself is different.  Try the flat bread pizza which is extremely thin making it fun to eat.  Their chopped salad is wholesome and coherent; each spoonful is a perfect blend of different flavors (unlike one of those large pieces of lettuce that take up an entire bite). You also can't beat $4.00 mimosas.",1
5,"I was visiting Tucson recently and was told to try Agustin Brasserie by a local patron I had met. First of all, the place is beautiful! Classic, stylish, clean and very welcoming. Felt comfortable upon entering. Service was top notch, my service was by a very knowledgeable woman named, Heidi. I had a hard time deciding what to order and after she questioned my taste, she recommended the salmon along with a perfectly paired white wine. I have to say, best salmon ever! I'm from Seattle, so I know salmon. The meal was fantastic and her service was stellar! I am sad I live far because I would frequent Agustin on a regular and I'd be so happy to return for her service!THANK YOU Heidi and Agustin Brasserie! I will be back next time I am in Tucson!",2
4,"So every now and then I have a BIG carb craving. I mean a no-holds-barred...pizza and breadsticks and cookies kind of carb craving. If I'm gonna cheat...this is the place I want to cave to! Their meatball sub is sooo perfect! Nice broiled bread with just the right amount of gooey cheese on top of the meatballs. Nothing pretentious...just a damn good sandwich. My kids love their garlic knots and they're a great price to grab and go without feeling like you paid a ton. Oh, and do yourself a favor...get the chocolate chip cookie. Don't skimp...it's only two bucks and the size of a dessert plate. They're  buttery and soft with a nice crunch on the outside. You'll thank me later. Remember...You can always work it off at the gym.",2
5,"Absoulutely loved the ambience of this place! The food was beyond delicious and I was blown away by the dessert. Also, service was very good!!",2
1,"Just had lunch with family here today. Awful service. First, steaks were not cooked as we had asked. Second, they ran out of our sides and instead of asking us before they brought the food out if we would like to substitute or wait for it to come out with our meal. They just brought out our meal and said it'd be 15 minutes for the rest. Asked for manager, manager trivialized our concern. Tried to explain their communication process as if it wasn't their fault. When I told her that this should have been communicated to us first, she gave up and stated flatly what we wanted her to do. I don't know? Why don't you tell me what you're going to do. Don't expect your customer to handle your problem. As a manager, take initiative and fix the problem. After that, we had a free appetizer on our phone. Waitress took phone instead of writing it down. (Seriously people, this is a liability on your end if the phone breaks or there is privacy issues.) And failed to use it. So charged another person the appetizer in an attempt to hide the fact. Seriously, stay away from this one. Usually have a good time at other Texas Roadhouses. Never going back to this one.",0
5,I am very happy with the selection here and even happier with the service I received from Charlie.,2
5,I make it my goal to try every taco place in a new city I've moved to. Second best taco place in Tucson. Comparable to LA tacos which I love. These are true street tacos and for a great price. Easily one of my favorite places to go.,2
4,"We stayed at the intercontinental during our visit and this place was a no brainer in terms of the proximity to our hotel and the reviews. We dragged our hungover asses out of bed and walked in here with hopes of eating some delicious food and a well needed dose of caffeine. We each got started with coffee, which was absolutely fantastic. I ordered the southern breakfast and requested toast instead of sausage, while my friends ordered the soft shell crab and crab omelet. I loved the food I ordered.. except everything lacked a little seasoning. Also, the bacon was completely dry. I love bacon in any shape or form, so I didn't seem to mind the lack of grease. The jalapeno grits were spectacular and so was the biscuit. My friends seemed to really enjoy their breakfast as well. The fries again, lacked seasoning which seemed odd. How does one forget to add salt to fries? We were too hungover to notice or care.. Overall, its a pretty good place if you're looking for decent French food.",2
1,"Holy crap worst haircut of my life!!! I feel terrible because she was so sweet but it looks like a 5 year old took scissors and started guessing! It's so bad I can't even wear it in a ponytail or bun without having choppy (what should be layers, looks like boxes) pieces that are super uneven hanging out. My ponytail looks like someone butcher my hair and left random pieces. Beware! I get my hair cut and trimmed regularly, figured this was closer to home and I'd try it out for a quick trim. Never again. It's not blended and evening blending couldn't fix it, the haircut alone wasn't straight, my right is longer then my left with randomly boxy chops. So embarrassed of my head!!! Have to go get it fixed elsewhere.",0
5,"This place is adorable. I walk into the store and it like I've been transported to a young girls toy box (in the best possible way). You walk into a glass case of available cupcakes for your choosing. The cupcakes are aligned perfectly and all ready to eat.I chose a sundae, because it sounds so fun, right?! A cupcake cut in half with ice cream in the middle - Yes, please! A bonus of this location is the Cupcake ATM available right outside. This allows you to buy the cupcakes that are made fresh that day, without walking into the store. Very fun, but don't miss the inside, because you just might change your mind on what cupcake to eat!",2
4,"Loved Penang during my time in Boston, so I was excited to see one in Philly's chinatown! Quality of the food was about the same too. The menu is fairly diverse, and offers a variety of thai, malaysian, indian and chinese dishes. Definitely try the roti canai, probably the most ordered item in the restaurant. You get a huge blanket of roti, wrapped artfully into a sculpture. It is only a couple millimeters thick and strikes a perfect balance between crispiness and chewiness. It goes great with the accompanying curry sauce, which also contains some pieces of chicken and potato. I also tried out the indian mee goreng on my most recent visit. It certainly had a lot of taste and went well with the other dishes I ordered, but a warning that there is a strong seafood taste (they use dried squid sauce).Another favorite of mine is the beef rendang. The beef is super tender and the curry sauce it is cooked in is delicious - tastes of coconut milk and lemongrass, with hints of cinnamon. Order a bowl or two of rice to go with this!Finally, I would order the spareribs malaysian style. These pork shortribs are lightly fried, but the meat is juicy and goes really well with the accompanying sweet and sour sauce! Service overall is quite good and the food comes out at a reasonable pace. This place does get crowded though!",2
4,"Great little sports bar with cool games like ski ball, basketball, hockey, and darts. I got a mixed drink that was served in way too small a glass tho :( Pretty nice beer selection tho :) Big seating area in other room and a nice roomy outside patio/deck, but the view is of train tracks but whatevs",2
4,The court house is very old and the art is great. The spiral staircase is funny. One can get view of entire city from 5th level. The tower clock room is really surprising with all mechanical gears inside!! You need a prior appointment to get into clock room. Worth spending 2 to 3 hours of time here.,2
1,"F*** this place I will never come back here, the people told me to pay before they did my manicure, I mean I know not many black males or males in general come in to get these things done, but dam.",0
4,"Clean restaurant with quick and friendly service. Today is the 60tg anniversary and they're offering 60¢ pancakes as a special. Food is fresh and prepared quickly. Getting to the restaurant is a bit difficult as it is on a road with a lot of traffic, and parking is less than ideal for space. It is a bit crowded. Overall a good experience.",2
5,"I love 12 South so much.  It is a certified Iyengar studio, meaning it follows a teaching tradition that emphasizes form and refinement in poses, and often uses props to ensure that newer students, or people with specific needs, are able to receive the benefit of each pose.  I love this style, and personally feel it's ideal for the beginner.Every teacher I've had here has been great, but I usually take with either Aretha Blevins or Rachel Mitchell, and they're both fabulous.12 South may be my most favorite Nashville business!",2
1,This nightclub is complete let down. The music was a train wreck. The dj would play a good song for 10 seconds then mix to another song that was completely off the wall like a train wreck. I would go to dance floor to start dancing and by the time I made it the song was changed.  I was in the club Fri and Sat night and dj played same mix. The dj acted like. he was mixing but never had his headphones on. Hey mister dj u suck learn to dj better. Here is a tip play music longer and don't change songs . Ur selection of music is good but u mixed into dumb ass off the wall. Like u would play snoopdogg for 10secs then mix to billie jean I'm not Ur lover by mj then to 50 cent  all three songs in less than a minute.   The dj ruined the club. The bartenders were great. Made drinks strong and service was quick. If it wasn't for them I would have left in a heartbeat.  There is only one bathroom. That. Sucks  there is 2 port a potties in back in the dark. At 1030 the guys bathroom had throw up all over the walls and the hallway by bar stink like death. I mentioned it to many employees and they said I'm not maintenance and didn't seem to care. My visit to tonic nightclub was a complete letdown and was a shity experience. Overated nightclub.,0
5,"I love this place, too bad I only go about 4 times a year.  Its more of treat for me.  Quality food & service and would expect nothing less based on the price.",2
1,"My experience with Kehoe was overwhelmingly negative, so much so that I joined Yelp to write about it. I was overcharged, and the check-out person was incredibly rude. In response to the original review, I received an apology and partial refund, which is nice (ignoring the creepiness factor of that). I would not go to Kehoe again, even if my car died in front of their lot, but I hope others have a better experience.",0
5,"This small quaint place is a gem! I found this restaurant on Groupon. The food was delicious. I really enjoyed the calm atmosphere, music and art on the walls. The customer service was excellent. The food was flavorful!",2
4,"Despite being a spin-off at the burgers from Rouge, I actually think that the burgers here are, dare I say it, better then flagship restaurants.Over the last year they keep expanding their burger and toppings options by editing the little placard next to the registers, instead of changing their giant menuboard every time  they decide to add a new cheese or vegetable you can put on the burger.I've been here a few times, trying the 500 (lettuce, bacon, cheddar, special sauce) delicious, and also making my own combos with their Kobe Beef burger (I think its worth the extra few bucks). I like it with truffle cheese and grilled onions. The brioche bun also really makes these burgers something special.Their fries are also extremely delicious. As a huge fan of truffle oil, I can never resist getting their truffle oil fries. When they come warm out of the fryer, coated in truffle oil, there is just no better taste known to man.Most important of all, they are open late on weekends.",2

5,"Franklin, TN is adorable! And within this ADORABLE little city, on this ADORABLE street, is an ADORABLE restaurant called Red Pony.I made reservations for the bf's birthday and because we were on a road trip. Upon arrival we were greeted by a very sweet hostess. Our waitress was friendly, knowledgeable and prompt. Fried green tomatoes, trout, a salad, and an amazing slice of coconut cake later, we were on cloud 9. This place is a gem!",2
4,This was our first time eating there. My sons and I enjoyed our meal. Quick and friendly service. Its close to their schools so they had a nice dinner out. We love pho and Lilly's is a nice place to get your fix.,2
1,"First time trying this place as we always drive past it. We felt so rushed. We were looking for a relaxing date night. We sat at a regular table. The bartender who sat us very friendly. The girl who took our order didn't get the order right. I ordered sashimi prior to my meal which never even came out. She was in such a hurry didn't even seem like she was listening. We had three apps, soup and salad all come at the same time. Who does that? It doesn't need to be fine dining but at least let us enjoy one course at a time. Needless to say we won't go back.",0
3,We've been going here for years but over the last 6 months its been a downhill slide. The service has become inept.. Slow and sometimes painful to watch. Management seems to have a problem hiring competent staff or keeping thdm once they are trained. The food is almost always good but not a bargain unless you use a Restaurant.com coupon.Decent happy hour drink prices.I just wish they could train the staff better.,1
5,"I have heard my coworkers mention fried cheese curds before and thought to myself what in the world is a fried cheese curd. Well, today I finally got the chance to find out. They are delicious!!! They remind you of fried mozzarella but way better. Pretty expensive but well worth it if you are trying them for the first time.I also got the smokey ketchup dipping sauce which paired great with the cheese curds. I would not recommend eating these often because it is a lot of fried cheese, but if you must have some fried cheesy goodness, this is the way to go. I will never look at mozzarella sticks the same again.",2
2,"Average to below average food. Below average wait staff.Standard food options with some unusual missing choices and some unusual additions. For example, buffalo wings?, meatloaf?  Wait staff inexperienced on basics.  Expect to have to grab forks and extra napkins from neighboring set tables. Overall a disappointment. Great spot for a restaurant. Poor execution.",0
1,"My boyfriend and I were looking for some good Mexican food for his birthday, and since I missed the boat on getting a reservation at El Vez I figured we would give this a try. The reviews seemed okay and everyone said that the drinks were really good. Not at all true....To start with, we ordered the guacamole. I have had a lot of different kinds and make it myself at home, and this was incredibly bland with not a lot of flavor.  I ordered the Carnitas Tacos and my boyfriend got the Brisket Tacos (special of the day). They were all right, but the waiter told us right off the bat he would recommend a side since they were small portions.  We didn't end up eating any of our side since they were so big, we each only finished two tacos! The most disappointing part of this whole experience was the drinks.  I got the Classic Mojito (which I have also had and made many times before) and he got the Mexican style Mojito, that apparently is with cilantro and tequilla instead of rum and mint.  The first batch were really delicious, so we ordered another round. Not at ALL the same drink.  They looked very different, but mainly they didn't taste at all similar.  Very very sweet and acidic, way too bitter.  We politely called the waiter over and asked if the bartender wouldn't mind remaking them since the first drinks we had were very different, and he obliged. A few seconds later the bartender came back and told us she remade the drinks but tasted them and they tasted exactly how they should be.  She was very condescending and rude (My boyfriend and I have both worked in customer service before...when customers are being polite in their complaints, there is no need to be rude back) and said she would make the drink for us 10 times if we wanted but it wouldn't be any different. She said that they first AMAZING drink we had must have been made wrong.  She kept asking us how they were different and we had trouble explaining to her exactly what to change, so we decided to let it go and asked for the check. Yes, we still got charged for the shitty drinks that we left on our table. For a tequilla bar who is apparently known for their drinks, the inconsistency is frightening.  I was very disappointed in the entire experience, not what I was planning for the first birthday that my boyfriend and I spent together.",0
1,"Stayed at tradewinds and thought beef o bradys would be a good idea.  Not so muchI ordered blackened fish and my daughter ordered chicken strips. Her meal arrived in 30 minutes....fries ok but chicken was cold.  Waited for the fish....and waited....and waited. I was entertained by the dripping Ac over my head.  The server was mia most of the time....came over and asked if I had received my food....obviously not ....and said it would be right out ""she thought"".  30 min later she showed up with fish did not resemble the photo on the menu, wilted salad with the wrong dressing, and gross looking rice.  When I told her she could take it back she shrugged her shoulders and said ok. The food is not good here.   Save your $ and go somewhere else.",0
4,Step up from the Cheesecake Factory...I enjoy the happy hour menu. Atmosphere is nice and food is good. Our waiter was a little clueless one night but the manager made up for everything and that's the one of the reason that I continue to give them my business.,2
4,"So far, so good, Biscuit Love! I have to admit, though: I am worried about reviewing this Biscuit Love location, because it is completely possible that it will end up with lines just as long as its Gulch location!We arrived to Biscuit Love at 8:30am on a Saturday. To our pleasant surprise, there was zero wait! That alone earns you a star, Biscuit Love! In addition, the self-serve sparkling and still water machine is a nice touch.I ordered the Princess with an egg on top. Trust me, hot chicken and eggs for breakfast is a gorgeous & delicious thing! I devoured the entire meal in very short order. The only problem I could find was the coffee. It tasted burnt and left something to be desired. Then again, if you are going to Biscuit Love for its coffee, you're doing it all wrong!From what I can tell, this location is something of a ""locals secret."" I did not see any obvious tourists here. If you ARE a tourist, though - welcome to Nashville! I highly encourage everyone who reads this review, locals and tourists alike, to visit this location instead of the one in the Gulch.",2
5,Love coming here to get a fully stuffed bagel.....lox is fresh and cream cheese is full of flavor. Ordered an everything bagel with lox & scallion bacon cream cheese and an iced coffee. Everyone is nice that works here and It is truly the perfect Sunday brunch food!,2
1,"Think twice before renting from Event Rental -- they regularly and knowingly overcharge their customers. Make sure you know exactly what services are being performed, and pay close attention to your bill. Their business policy and practice is to fraudulently charge customers for work not performed whenever there are back to back events.Long story relatively short: tents were rented three days in a row at a venue for three separate parties (one day for each party). Mine was the middle day (Saturday). I was charged almost $250 (a third of my total cost, which they make you pay upfront) for delivery and ""after-hours"" pickup (labor fees) for my Saturday event at a venue, even though I realized about a week after my event that the same tents were standing on both the day before (Friday day and through the night) and the day after (the tents stayed standing through Saturday night and through Sunday morning). So basically, they set up the tents on Friday, left them up through the weekend until sometime on Sunday, and then charged each of the three parties separately for the full cost of delivery/pickup labor. After many attempts to call and speak to a manager and never receiving a call back, I was told there was nothing they could do about it -- one employee even stated explicitly that it is the company's standard procedure to charge each separate client for the full price of delivery and pickup, even if only one delivery and one pickup each are performed for a weekend consisting of three different events. So after many days of no return calls and no communication from upper management or any admission of wrongdoing, I had to file a claim with my credit card company.It's clearly a dishonest way of conducting business (""scam"" is the correct word), and when I confronted them about it in a respectful manner, they refused to admit any wrongdoing and ignored the issue until I got the credit card company involved.",0
5,Absolutely one of the best shops in the country. Incredibly patient and helpful in both rebuilding and choosing a bike.,2
1,Kinda a dive bar but could have been cool.  We found the girl bartender to be pretentious and rude.  All she seemed to care about is rushing through our order so she could go back and talk to her friends and giving smart ass answers every time you asked her a question.,0
2,"More and more underwhelming with every visit. The first time I came, I enjoyed it. Charming, quaint, simple. Glass of wine, good salad. Good times. Return! Grainy, bland, mac and cheese. Still, a gorgeous day, another gorgeous glass of wine. Third time (and likely last visit). French onion soup was poorly-flavored onion water with an abundance of cheese and crouton. Special chicken-prosciutto creamy pasta was under-seasoned (but thank you for the salt and fresh pepper grinder at the table so I can season my own food). It's not like I just added a sprinkling of pepper to enhance. There was absolutely no taste. What I consider an abundance of salt was added - unacceptable for a $17.50 plate of pasta. Chocolate mousse was well-textured, chocolatey, but could have been richer. Too sugary sweet.  I will likely never experience this place for a fourth trip. It's just not good enough, and who wants to go to a restaurant that's a crap shoot?",0
4,It's big!  Very big. 50 lanes and at 5pm on a Saturday we had 48 to choose from. The food is similar to a small diner if you dare. Lanes were good am the kids enjoyed their time at the lanes.,2
3,"Have been 5 times now...1. Needs more wait staff2. Owner should just be the hostess not      wait staff too.3. Every time she sits a table & waits on it, it takes forever to get back to your table. Stop visiting w/ everyone --hence just be the hostess!4. Get rid of Video Games, no space for them. ( super ugly)5. Food portions are good.6. Reasonable prices.7. Carpinteria is desperate for a decent meal.",1
5,"Listen, I can even take my meat-eating parents here without a hitch, so they've gotta be doing something right. I have encountered almost zero disappointment at this place. I've been vegan for almost 10 years now, lived all over, and this is the best vegan take-out joint I've EVER been to. My favourites are probably the Crispy HipCity Ranch ('chickn' burger), Ziggy Burger (tempeh), Jerk Caesar Salad, Green Lemonade and sweet potato fries... my Philly-native husband loves the cheesesteak.I love salad but couldn't get into the udon and spinach salads (could have just been the service that day---few toppings on either). Definitely don't make up your mind about this place until you've tried a burger!",2
5,"We finally made it over to Sno-La and it was WORTH IT.  The cheesecake stuffed snoball blows the regular  ice cream stuffed snoball out of the water! Absolutely delicious and worth the drive into Metairie. The parking lot is a tad tricky for parking, but you won't be sorry :)",2
3,"I had a quad expresso this morning, I really like this coffe shop. Nice prople and great service.  Better than my first visit but still learning to appreciate their blend,",1
5,"This place is super cool. Totally relaxed atmosphere. Delicious ""maryland style"" crab balls. Very pleasant owner. Definitely recommended!!",2
1,"First off if there was a lesser rating I could give it I would. Never in my whole entire life have I ever been to a place that handled a situation so horribly. So a group of us went in for Valentine's Day, we had a reservation for 8 and were sat by 845, no big deal we were just a bit cranky and hungry. The host was very nice and was trying her best.  We finally get sat and get drinks ordered and Our appetizers. It's going well, our server was nice and we were happy. Now this is where it goes down hill. Our appetizers come out about 5-10 mins apart. We brushed it off. A party that got sat after us were now getting their entrees? We start getting irritable at this time we've been in the restaurant for 2 hours. We finally start getting out entrees. 5 people are missing theirs. Sever comes over tells our friend their out of what she wanted. Would've been nice to know before everyone stared receiving their food. But she got to pick whatever she wanted for free, not bad. Everyone is now done with their meals and My friend beside me never got her food. By this time the restaurant is basically empty. The manager comes over and just goes "" what did you have"" my friend told her then she just walked away. No apology. Nothing. Her food finally comes out and she asks our sever why was she just now receiving her food? He replies with ""oh you know the kitchen gets slammed, things happen"" our jaws nearly hit the floor. Granted they comped her meal. But everything was poorly executed and the manager never stopped by to apologize, our server never apologized.   I guessed they assumed that they were gonna go down in flames cause they thought passing out a $5 off coupon for next time would do anything. Safe to say we spent 3 hours in a restaurant for a lousy experience. The food was decent but not worth it. Like the saying goes "" you can fix lousy food with great service but you can't fix lousy service with great food"" and we don't ever, ever plan on coming back here. I get that it was Valentine's Day and it was busy, completely understood but it's the mangers job to smooth over the situation. Comping the food is great but that doesn't fix anything. Get it together macaroni grill.",0
4,Good Chinatown Flavor in South Philly. I usually get the Wonton Noodle Soup here that is comparable to Chinatown Restaurants. Clean Friendly Atmosphere. If you don't want to deal with the traffic downtown I suggest stopping by here.,2
5,"The attendant was extremely helpful,  we were looking for a fairly uncommon liquor and they had it. Pretty good selection, friendly staff.",2
4,"Giant Jenga is worth the trip, I'm a sucker for odd bar games, and I loved it!  I went for my birthday and we had a great time.  The food is pretty good and it is cheap, staff was friendly to our group, and you can take shots from a ski. I guess it just depends on the night you go as to the atmosphere.  I've only been a couple times with a big group of friends, so I would say if you'd like a larger extension of your living room with drinks and games, come on in.",2
5,"My cousin recommended this place to me, and I was a little skeptical at first, but oh my goodness, this place is DIVINE!  It was very crowded, since we went on a Friday night, but we asked to sit outside and got seated immediately. The atmosphere was very nice. Inside, there's a huge aquarium, and we stood there and looked at it for about 20 minutes, lol. They had really cool decor. Then when we went outside, there was a big stone fountain, which was beautiful. Our server was very prompt and always made sure we had what we needed. Now, on to the food. :) You know how when you taste something REALLY good and you just can't help but let out a ""MMMMMM""? Well that's how it was for me. I had the Texas Cheese Fries for an appetizer, oh goodness. They were amazing. And there were TONS of them. The peach tea - amazing. Grilled salmon - amazing. And the sides, ah! I had corn and mashed potatoes and broccoli cheese casserole. They were SO good! Plus the prices were surprisingly low for the quality :) I love this place and I'll definitely go again!",2
3,Good selection of donuts. A lot of very sweet donuts. Sliders are good. Donuts are average. Service excellent. Cinnamon roll tasted just like Cinnabon with less frosting. It needed more cinnamon.,1
5,Just about as good as all the BBQ places around. First time today and spot on. Pulled pork dam good as was the sausage. You can always tell a good BBQ joint by the smoked sausage. Great job.,2
5,"One of my favorite places in the city.  The food is great, the beer is cold and the people are awesome.  The VIP card is a great way to reward the loyal regulars and this bar has plenty of them.   Even as a smoker, I was glad they went smoke-free, it's a small space and when it got crowded, it got very smoky, but that's in the past.  They have done a lot of painting and redecorating, giving the place a nice facelift in the last year and the new(ish) menu is great.  The Chili and the wings are what I order most often.  Some of the best wings in St. Louis.",2
4,"This Wendy's is a good location. Open 24 hours for the midnight fry and frosty fix. They are pretty busy all day long so they are constantly making food non-stop.The downfall to the constant food production is that sometimes they make so much, a burger may sit around and get luke warm. I did just have a cool temp burger and nuggets, however when i brought it the their attention, they immediately made sure i got fresh 'hot and juicy' food. Not a big deal but does need patience. Since i ate inside it was not that big a deal, if i went to the drive through and then hopped on the Turnpike before i took a bite, i would be very upset.Food quality was consistent with other Wendy's and the 4th star was for customer service and fixing the mistake like a pro!",2
2,"Decent place to get a drink and usual diner/bar food. It's always really crowded, and I'm not really sure why- maybe because most diners don't have liquor licenses.Large portions of usual diner fare.",0
1,"I recently dined there for a birthday gathering. The restaurant was mostly vacant and our 20 person party was placed in the back. We were assigned 1 waiter who worked his hardest to serve a party so large; however, drinks were late and not refilled, silverware was dirty with old food from previous customers (in multiple sets), and food came out late. I have worked customer service and usually ignore the small mistakes. We are all human. However, our waiter should not have been alone in serving a party so large. Moreover, a glass shard damaged my pants and scratched me from sitting on my chair. The manager on duty gave me a bandaid and contact information to relay my experience. I feel like I needed to explain my experience and my disappointment of the way the situation was handled to the point of not returning. We paid for our meal in full and left with a bloody rip in my pants.",0
3,I had lunch here a few days back and was surprised it wasn't as busy as I thought it would be.  All those in my group order a sandwich for lunch and they all looked good and it was confirmed that they tasted good.  I took the other road and ordered the special of the day.  Tutto Mare with Caesar salad as a sub.  Although it was an upcharge it was nice to know that they didn't.  The dressing was the best I've had in awhile.  The pasta was very good and the sauce seemed to taste as though it was from scratch.  The only downside was the shrimp on the dish was shell on.  Its the first time I've had it with the shell on.  Although it was good it was very messing peeling the shrimp covered with a cream/alfredo sauce.  I'd go back for the sandwich/burgers but not sure about anything trying to be upscale.  The pretzel bites with cheese sauce were very tasty.,1
4,"Yay for local flavors :) warning: do not come here to eat if you're on a diet haha...Maybe it's just me, but Groupon is probably my (2nd) main source of how to decide which places to try.  Katie's is a neighborhood place, and everyone's super friendly. There's plenty of street parking, so no worries about parking meters or anything.The food was yum! What we had:-Crawfish beignet: spicy with a hint of sweet, creamy (cause of the cheese), all highlighting the crawfish goodness :) I liked the marriage of flavors.-Atchafalaya pizza: topped with seafood goodies :) the crust was super thin and overall delish! the grilled garlic adds a very nice touch (I LOVE garlic).-Fried green tomato and shrimp poor boy: I'm sorry New Orleans, but after trying different poor boys from different places, I decided that I just don't like poor boys in general :(... so my opinion for this one would be very biased...Maybe it's cause at dinner time I eat really healthy most of the time (fish, or veggies, and fruits only), but I ended up with a huge tummy ache :( though I enjoyed my time here, I hate having an upset stomach after eating... or maybe it's cause I'm slightly lactose intolerant -.- oh why do I do this to myself?",2
4,"Not bad for a first visit! I ordered the Farmhouse Breakfast, which includes eggs your way, two slices of bacon, potatoes and choice of toast. For a Saturday brunch we were in and out in an hour but when we left it was getting busy so don't be surprised if there is a wait.Bub's Burgers down the street starts every meal with a free chili shooter, and Bub's Cafe version is a small container of granola - yum. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here but it is a convenient breakfast in the Carmel Arts & Design District.",2
5,"My favorite spot in town to grub at. The food is delicious and authentic creole cuisine. Whenever I want a nice home cooked meal I come here. I've had several menu items. Their fried chicken and wings r the best I've ever eaten at a restaurant. Red beans r awesome, the Jambalaya is my fav :) the. My fav thing to get for dessert is the scoop of icecream with the praline sauce ahhhhh sooooo yummmyyyy omg... I've taken my mom n all my friends here several times. I love sassafras. If you are looking to eat here do it u won't be disappointed..The only negative I have to say is that I don't like that all the menu items aren't served everyday like it used to be now certain items are served on certain days but still great tho.",2
5,"We went on a Friday afternoon.  There was hardly anyone in the place, which was a bit worrisome initially.  However once we got our food and drinks soon realized this place was great!The waitstaff was excellent.  We had 2 different servers, as we stayed for a long time and the first waitress was getting off.  Our service was seamless.  The food was good, but the presentation of each dish was not what food critics would consider visually stunning.  The nachos were freaking huge!  As a nacho connoisseur I found this to be delightful.  The drinks were very good and they have a nice house drink menu.The view of John's pass is really nice.  They have an outdoor area with a few seats that would be good in less windy weather than we experienced.  This would also be a good place to park your boat and come in for a bite to eat.",2
4,Handsdown the best pastor taco around. The other tacos are decent but pastor is the way to go!,2
4,"Taste is individual, and this reviewer thinks the fro-yo tastes great.  The flavors and consistencies are just right for the following I have tried: vanilla, strawberry-banana, coconut, mango, lychee, almond, and pistachio.  The toppings are fine and the people working there seem pleasant.  Like the outdoor seating.The downside is the layout inside -- it is cramped and narrow.  It makes navigation difficult (esp. with a stroller).Make sure you get the Tutti Fruitti card punched out with each purchase!",2
3,"Would I come here again? Probably. I'd give it another shot and try flour tortillas with chicken for my tacos this time though. The corn tortillas are thick, so thick they kind of fall apart when you're eating your tacos. I felt like the taste of the corn over powered the meat. I had carne asada tacos, the meat was ok quality, I got a lot of gristle which wasn't the greatest. The rice, beans and horchata were all A+. Be warned, the chili they serve here is really, really hot. Normally I love hot chili/salsa, but this one kind of left my mouth numb and it didn't really have a flavor.",1
5,Super tasty and enormous portions. Some unique flavors too. Not much else to say but an amazing ice cream store that others should try to emulate.,2
3,"Place was okay, sushi was good, hibachi was way too fast. Not as entertaining as most hibachi restaurants. Scallops was a little under cooked and the Steak didn't have much flavor. The service was very good though.",1
4,Oysters on the half shell are giant and delish! Also tried the chargrilled oysters and those might just change your life! This restaurant does not take reservations but they were able to accommodate a group of 10 of us in a fair amount of time on a Tuesday night. Definitely recommend giving this place a try!,2
5,"Aaaaah man Landry's seafood House was awesome.  Me and my fiancé sat upstairs by the window and had a nice view of the water.  Our server Nathan was great and very attentive as well.  The bartender made amazing drinks and the food was on point!  We had the crab cake, oysters and a shrimp poy boy.  Everything was made exceptionally well! Definitely a must visit when in NAWLINS!",2
5,"This place is a real hidden gem... literally... emphasis on hidden. Off the beaten path, you won't find this place unless you are looking for it. It is a old historic stage coach (mud wagon)  pit stop converted into a nice little restaurant. Parking mat be hard to find, and the wait might be a few minutes, but if we are ever back in the area we will definitely go back. Food was good, atmosphere was great. It was a memorable dining experience.",2
5,"Oh I really do love this place. I'm so glad my son and I went last Sunday. We had the German town west Benny, an eggs Benedict with smoked salmon, and the bananas foster pancakes. The food was incredible and service was great. For us, the cozy converted house with wooden floors, art on the walls and music playing made our visit just extra special! Oh and the southern pecan coffee..where ya been all my life?! This is a must for when in Nashville.",2
4,"HL is one of those stores that when I walk in I want to buy everything. I have purchased fabric, ribbon, home decor, scrapbook stuff, a lamp, seasonal items, baskets, and many more things here. The best part is I've rarely, if ever, payed full price. They ALWAYS have amazing sales. Usually 50% off. If something you want isn't on sale, wait a week or 2. It will be. I promise. Also, sign up for their weekly email and they will send you a coupon every Sunday. But don't try to use it on a Sunday because they are closed on Sundays, which is why they are losing a star. Boooooo for businesses closed on Sundays! (yeah, I'm talking to you too, Chick fil A)",2
4,"Excellent service. Sent a request online and within 30-45 mins had a call back. Got the spot scheduled. Shanna was Prompt on arrival, very informative with prevention and such.Checked both mine and my daughters head. Full treatment on both. It is a bit pricey but I already had one round and was over it all. The off the shelf stuff just doesn't work. The comb they use is not available in stores and gathers the nits way better. Only complaint is the comb should be included in the session not extra. I bought it cause I wanted to have the proper tools in case of a next time.",2
1,"Went because we had a Groupon, wouldnt go back again. Granted there was a large table next to us (8 or 9) but we had put our order in before they sat, took over 20 minutes for our appetizers to come out, drinks were never brought to the table nor was bread. Had to ask for silverware and plates to eat the appetizer. We order their special app which consisted of 3 oysters and 4 clams, which were very fresh. The shrimp cocktail that came out was not.I ordered their seafood platter which was 3 shrimp flounder and a cluster of crab legs. Would have been better if the crab legs werent water logged, the shell had no crispness to it. I honestly opened each leg by tearing the shell like paper.My wife ordered the softshell crabs which were delicious, but we couldnt finish them because our dishes were cleared.Total bill came out to 102.00 not worth the wait or the food",0
4,Holy Moly!   Huge amount of food.  I ordered the Cuban special with fries 6$  definitely worth every dime.  I was staving and this was a great little whole in the wall.  Décor was a little outdated.  The waitress was so pleasant and friendly we chatted the whole time I was waiting for my order - I must say it was fast ... a definite stop over place that I will go to again.,2
4,"I didn't discover this place until a few months ago, even though I live less than 5 minutes away. It's tucked away in a small strip mall right off of Hwy. 70, behind TJ Maxx. It's definitely a hidden treasure and probably my favorite thing in the Bellevue area. I'm a big fan of their vanilla bean lemonade (try it - you'll like it!) and their cakes/cupcakes. My personal favorite is their Margarita cake - it's just wonderful. They also have really good vegan and gluten-free cupcakes, with plenty of flavors to choose from. My mouth is watering just thinking about their Margarita cake and vanilla bean lemonade... :) I've tried their sandwiches and lemon-artichoke soup a couple of times and they're alright - just not my thing. I think it's kind of expensive for what you get, so I just get dessert when I go there now. The interior is super cute and a perfect place to have lunch with your girlfriends. It does get crowded fairly quickly and parking can be at a premium during lunch time, so plan ahead.",2
5,I can't believe I haven't review Penang yet! I love this place. It's a a very popular Malaysian restaurant that offers pan-Asian food from Indian to Chinese. You can find something that will impress anyone's taste with their extensive menu. Pricing is great for the huge amount of food in an entree. I especially like the roti with chicken curry and chicken chow fun. The food is very flavorful and there is ample seating despite always being very busy. Sometimes the staff is less talkative than would be preferred but that's because they're so busy. I get takeout from here regularly and it's always ready within 10 minutes. 5/5,2
5,Great stadium. Love the Phillies and the stadium. Drank a lot of beer there. Loved and laughed there. It still looks good for being 12 yrs old. Looking forward to another World Series.      Go Phillies.,2
4,A great neighborhood coffee house.  (The hood in question is Dogtown.)  The java is good and draws a wide demographic from college kids to seniors to moms.  Not the pretty people scene that Kaldi's can be sometimes.  Very laid back and inviting.  Good food too.,2
5,"Park is beautiful.  Plenty to do at this park including tennis, racquetball, handball and more.  You can even rent equipment at Lanai Coffee right next to tennis courts.  There are bathrooms located behind tennis courts as well as next to the playground.  If hungry or thirsty while at park you have multiple choices of delicious snacks and drinks at Lanai Coffee as well.",2
4,Great ribs friendly service clean bathrooms!!  We will be back!  Thanks for the quick service!! Much appreciated!!,2
5,"This place is a hidden gem.  It is located in a strip mall, but this restaurant is anything but a strip mall restaurant.   My husband took me here for my birthday and I was blown away with the whole experience.  It's a very modern, romantic atmosphere.  The food is excellent.  I was shocked by the Fois gras-amazing.  I had the prix fixe menu and I loved ordering 3 courses.  The short ribs were great, but I want to try something new next time.  The desserts were awesome.  I usually take caramel, but there was a caramel tart that was to die for.  Can't wait to go back!!!!",2
1,OMG! Is the night crew here slow and frankly not too bright. Took 1/2 hour in the drive thru to get a chocolate chip milk shake and they still made it wrong. Yikes!  Skip this location and hit cold stone creamery instead.,0
5,"Very clean, nice staff, tasty food, generous portions and great prices.  Try it, you will like it.",2
3,"I have so far made two stops to pick up lunch from the buffet at Mumbai Bistro and can say, without any reservations, that it is perfectly adequate.  I have not been blown away by anything, and the flavors of the dishes I have sampled (Chicken Vindaloo, Chicken Tikka Masala, Mumbia Dal, and Navratan Korma) were fairly muted.  They also tout that the food is prepared without butter or ghee.  Um - I am not sure this is a good thing.  I enjoy the richness of Indian food; if I want light, I'll get a salad or something Mediterranean. The mumbai dal (a lentil dish) was so saucy and skimpy on the lentils that it might as well have been a broth-based soup.In spite of my gripes, I do expect I will go back to Mumbai Bistro.  They fill a void for low-key, inexpensive Indian takeout in the immediate neighborhood.  They have a few tables set up to eat it, but it looks like their primary business is simple take-out.  The food (while somewhat uninspired) was all cooked well, and seemed fresh and hot in the buffet.  The space is clean, and the staff have all been friendly.  The idea of ""lighter"" Indian fare is not a bad one, but I would love to see them amp up their flavor a bit.",1
5,"Casa Video is FANTASTIC for anything you want! I love this place. They appear to have new releases and all of that, but I love them for old stuff...DVDs of all the stuff I love from the 70s and 80s. Amazing staff, so cool.",2
3,"I really want to love this place and give it a full 5 stars but just cannot due to one major flaw in their menu. The pita at this place is ALL WRONG, it's too fluffy and soft, almost like a pita shaped version of wonder bread and it ruins their Shawarma sandwiches. Real pita has some structure and chew to it but unfortunately Naf Naf doesn't make it this way and what ends up happening is you have a soggy mess of a pita sandwich that literally falls apart in your hands within the first few bites. I also feel that you don't really get very much food for the money; they are Subway-stingy with the meat and a smallish pita sandwich and drink with a small cup of rice or fries for 12 bucks is disappointing. The Halal Guys across town give you a huge amount of food in their platters for less than that.",1
1,Probably the worst haircut experience I've ever had. Trimmed my beard against my request and it came out very uneven. Took FOREVER. Workers were extremely inconsiderate. Definitely do not go here.,0
1,Ok well I'd heard so much about this place i had to try it. Well NEVER AGAIN! Dirty Dirty Dirty! Rude service. Chicken parm outrageous over priced. N never in life had chicken parm covered in black pepper. Would of sent back if waiter ever came back to table. Bread was so old n when asked for new i was questioned if i new what i was talking about. Well since i grew up in the food industry. I think i know. N from dirty table clothes. Too dirty glasses not once but 2x give up on clean one. If it wasn't for husband stopping me complaining right then u would of heard it all in person. I know restaurant have off nights. But this was beyond OFF.,0
3,"Good place to go for random books. However, every single book I wanted was new and full price even though they looked used. I am all for used books BUT at a used price! The past three visits however, I failed to find any of the books on my list. The staff was very helpful.",1
1,I had a reservation for 8 pm and arrived 5 minutes earlier. We were checked in and was told it wont be long. We sat waiting for 20 minutes and not even someone to acknowledge us to tell us how much longer.,0
4,First we shared a Blossom Onion (delicious ). Then we had rib eye steaks and they were cooked to perfection and had a great taste. We went on a Sunday about 2:00pm and were seated right away and service was OK. The waitress took our order in a timely manner but never came back to check on us to see if we needed anything until we asked for the bill.They have a Early Bird menu for $8.99 until 3:00pm but we wanted the Ribeye's ( not on the Early Bird Menu ) Will go back again.,2
5,"I came in, and although parking was small, it was easy to find a space. I walked into a modern, cozy little shop with high ceilings. I asked the very sweet and adorable barista what was popular and told her it was my first time in. I was recommended and received a DELICIOUS peppermint holiday drink with a little almond milk and peppermint pieces on the whipped cream -- I didn't catch the drink's name. I also got a really moist and delicious slice of lemon pound cake. I highly recommend this place and asking the baristas what's good!",2
4,"Their kitchen is open until 2am in Old City everyday, need I say more? Their food is great and they have a wonderful beer selection. I'm definitely a fan and will be returning anytime I'm in Old City. Also get their sweet potato fries, some of the best I've ever had!",2
4,"I like what this place does, the food is good, the service was excellent, and its a sort of twist on greek food. Owner was very nice and helpful, kinda tucked away off nolensville but easy to find. I recommend the falafel, and hummus.",2
5,"I love tazikis. It may not be authentic Greek food but it's a healthier option when you're eating out. I love the gyros and the Greek salad. They also have a kids menu, which my kids aren't big fans of but. they are very very picky. Every time I eat here I think I could live on Mediterranean diet.",2
2,"We decided to try this place out since it was a new Pho place close to our house.  Probably not going back.Food was ok...if you don't mind the noodles being a little over. Soup was not very hot and felt the prices were high considering how much food we got. My daughter ended up with a piece of bone in her spring roll.Service was pretty dismal. We were standing at the door for a good 5 minutes before we were even acknowledged.  It took even longer for someone to come by and take our order. They couldn't even get the order right. The bean sprouts, mint, and lemons we had to ask for and trying to get their attention was pretty painful. It took another table across from us to get the server's attention to get these and forks for my kids.I have never not tipped (usually no less than 10%), but these guys really made me consider not tipping at all...2 stars because the food was passable.",0
5,"What is not to love about Sherbrooke Liquor Store... seriously the best selection of beer in town, as well as a pretty awesome selection of spirits as well.The liquor store location is anything but ideal.  The surrounding shops are a bit suspect, and the area isn't one of the better ones in the city.  This is where my complaining is going to stop.  Once you walk into the doors, the staff are usually very good about greeting you.  The sliding door to the beer cooler is immediately on the right.  Bring your warm coat, it's cold in the cooler.  The cooler is chock a block full of beer, some wine and sake.  The space between the shelving is very narrow, and usually there isn't enough room to even get past someone else.  The shelves are floor to over 6 ft and full of various beers.  They have done a pretty good job of grouping the different beers (ie: local, seasonal, pilsners, fruit/flavour, etc.)  There are a few tags on the various beers in each section that highlight staff picks and hidden gems.  Which is always welcome, as you get to try something that someone else thinks is a winner.  The remainder of the liquor store (the heated part) isn't as crammed as the beer cooler, but still offers up a fairly big selection of different spirits and wines.  Overall, Sherbrooke is going for uniqueness and not quantity.  The beer selection is by far the best in the city.  They also have a very nice selection of wines and spirits.  Some of the spirits can be had for less, if you are going for the more common ones, the ones that can be found elsewhere.  I've had several conversations with different staff, and they are all very helpful and will help guide you if you need assistance.   This is my go-to for beer.",2
5,"Last Monday I jogged up the stairs out of the 19th and Market green line station and was basically punched in the face by the amazing smells coming from this food truck more than a block away. I'd eaten at the Falafel truck before so as soon as the incredible aromas of grilled marinated chicken hit my nose I knew what I was going to be chowing down on that day.The food at this truck is amazing. While the meal varies quite a bit from day today, there are a few things you can generally count on: a portion of delicious hummus, some really good falafel, a pita or roll, a generous helping of some of the best grilled, marinated chicken that I've ever tasted, and two other items. One of the two is usually some sort of risotto or pasta in sauce (which is always good). The other is often a sauce or fruit item. Recently, the chef has also been handing out cups of soup to people as they wait in line (different soups every day) and a bottle of Perrier with the meal. He does not list a price but generally charges $10, which is well worth it for an enormous and tasty meal that should last all day.It's also worth noting that the comments about the guy who runs this truck are not exaggerated. He is a real character and likes to go on and on about how high quality his food is, how difficult it is to get quality ingredients, etc. He wants to know if you like quality food and if you are willing to pay for quality. Quality quality quality. Quality. At first I found this a little off-putting but now I find it an endearing feature of the experience. He clearly cares a lot about what he does and as long as you don't take the conversation too seriously it'll be fine. My one MAJOR caveat for this place is do NOT try to eat here if you are very particular about your food. He gives you what he gives you and isn't going to be making anything specific to your tastes. It's also very hard to predict how spicy his food will be -- usually it's relatively mild but occasionally it can get quite hot. I wouldn't count on being able to get a description before getting served, so only venture here if you are fairly flexible about the flavor profile of what you are getting. I also might suggest shying away if you have food allergies. That said, if you can get past this you are in for a really flavorful meal at a good value!",2
4,"Very authentic! Great food, and great salsa bar! I really enjoyed it, and loved the outdoor seating!",2
5,Great Burger.  I kept thinking I was eating a smoked briscuit sandwich it was so flavorful.,2
3,Very very busy when I was there...stopped in for one and left good bartender once I got his attention .... only one bartender on a Sunday in 30th Street Station ???? REALLY????? I'm not slamming the bartender just who ever scheduled one bartender on a Sunday (or the bartender that called out sick),1
1,"This restaurant is seriously lacking in customer service!  We have dined many times at Dish.  We like the food.  We made a reservation two weeks ahead for 3 people.  When we arrived we were seated at the smallest table in the restaurant which barely fits two people.  The table next to us had an extra person added at the end, his back was literally a couple of inches from our table.  We asked for a table that would accomdate three people and not involve eating with someone's large back at our very tiny table.  We were rudely informed that it was a take or leave it situation.  It was very frustrating since we booked this as a special night out weeks earlier.  Unfortunately, we are writing this restraurant off our list.",0
4,"I really like this place, and have had great talks with the owner.  One thing I've found is that the female baristas aren't very friendly to me, and I think I'm a pretty friendly guy.  Today (7/29/11) in particular was a bit annoying: I frequently order iced-tea here, and love that I get a free refill.  I was not aware that there was a charge for a refill on iced-coffee.  The baristas were rude to me and I felt like an imbecile after my interaction.  I'd appreciate the following:  1.) Before pouring me a refill, it would have been nice to let me know it ain't free. 2.) If I express surprise at their being a charge, please don't tell me I don't have to have it.  3.) If I choose to have it because I don't want it to go to waste, please don't tell me ""It's not very good iced coffee"". If it's ""not good"", why the hell should I have to pay for a refill when I don't have to pay for a refill of the iced-tea that is delicious?",2
2,"First night went here, great place and food.  Second time different story.  Inattentive, incorrect order and food seems to be from a completely different kitchen!  Overheard other customers with issues too while waiting.  Hopefully they can fix and not let the young hosts and managers with attitude ruin before too late.",0
4,This hotel has a great location close to Reading Market and the room is very clean and comfortable. Customer service has been great! My husband is a big fan of the steam room on the fifth floor. Would stay here again without thinking about it.,2

5,"Great surprise sushi place. The miso soup was the best we have ever had, the house salad was actually good. I ordered Dinner Box A which came with four different items which three were fantastic and the steak over vegtables just ok. So we ordered more food. One eel and one tuna. That was amazingly fantastic. wow. I am really liked the sound of the waterfall.",2
5,I just took my dog here for the first time and it was a great experience. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable and it is also very affordable. I would recommend University Pet Clinic to anyone!,2
4,Nice wines and great location. Too bad they don't have food. But you can bring food up and enjoy the view with your pup so they get big points for being dog friendly! Lovely!,2
2,Does not have ramen. Only half the menu on here is correct. They have sushi and that's it.,0
5,"Fantastic classic Indian food, and very well executed.  Great atmosphere, great service, and delicious fare paired with traditional Indian beers. I will definitely be going back.",2
5,Amazing place for good fun. Got engaged last night and brought my now fiance with me to the n crowd. Asked if they could do a little shout out for her. Not only did they do a shout out they did a skit renacting her entire day. Was hilarious and really made the night extra special. Highly recommend the N Crowd to anyone who likes to laugh and have fun. A++++++,2
2,"I don't get this place.  I'm going to have to steer my boss clear of it next time we dine out.  The salads are way too small; the strombolis way too big.   The salad I ordered was fine, but nothing to write home about, and definitely left me feeling hungry.  My coworker ordered an appetizer ($10) as her main, and it looked like the size of a cadbury cream egg.  If we don't want a huge calzone for lunch, and also don't want a $15 pasta dish, you need to add something to your menu that satisfies more fully, isn't a heavy chicken parm sandwich, and doesn't break the bank.The ambience was weird, too.  They were playing like, the best hits of the 80s, 90s, and today, during lunch.  And loudly, at that. The restaurant was dark; they didn't have all of the lights turned on.  Service was meh.  This is lunch, not dinner.  Set the mood accordingly!",0
4,"Nice place to go if you're just looking for something casual. The pizza is really good, and there is always some sort of deal on beer. Just a nice place to hang with friends or watch a sports game!",2
4,"Don't let the location or the exterior of this little establishment fool you.  We were pleasantly surprised by how clean the place is and how modern the rooms were.  They must have recently upgraded and did some remodeling.  We had a King sized bed in our room and it was spacious and beautiful plantation shutters over their windows.  Flat screen TV, cute little decorative touches, and their bathroom was OMG!!!  I want my own home bathroom to look like that!  Beautiful granite counter-tops and granite walls in the shower.The only negative was the strangely scheduled demolition of their parking lot on a Sunday morning at 10am.  I mean, we were up and all but we were asked to move our car and then the noise was just insane.  Thankfully we checked out that day at 11am.  Whoever scheduled that construction work must've had screw loose.  Anyway, you won't be disappointed.  We went on Valentine's Day weekend, so prices were a bit higher.  But usually, I believe it ranges from $99-$110, which is definitely worth it!!!",2

5,"This place is amazing! The space is beautiful, great ambiance and super clean. Awesome color selection. Susan is fantastic!! Thank you Manicure Lane.",2
3,Great Food... Terrible beer tap lines. All of the beer tap lines are dirty. They need to be cleaned. There is no other reason why every beer tastes like a IPA. A Pilsner tastes like an IPA there because the previous beer on that line was most likely an IPA. I get canned beer here...The food is great. Atmosphere is good. Staff is very accommodating and friendly.,1
3,"This place does something magical and mystical -- you'll leave here heavier AND lighter!(That is -- you'll feel heavier, but your wallet will feel a lot lighter.)Stopped by here on a visit to Lumiere Place; figured it was worth a shot.  Didn't know anything about the pedigree of the chef or the place -- just that it was in the casino, I was hungry, and I was there.  Seated quickly (it was late in a Wednesday evening and pretty dead).  Server was attentive, patient to answer the questions I had, and was pretty efficient.First thing you'll notice when you open the menu - yeah.  Pricey, even for a gourmet burger joint.  You can either build your own burger (starting with a base at around $10 and adding on for extra ingredients ranging from truffles and caramelized onions to good ol' fashioned bacon and cheddar), or pick one of the select ones.  Those come with fries, so there's a slight savings there, since fries are separate for the main burgers.The fail here is that the burgers are about 75% the size of what you'd expect to get at the local burger hut.  That wouldn't ordinarily be a problem, except that the prices are about 25% higher than what you'd expect to pay at a gourmet/specialty burger place.  Yes, yes, this place is inside of a casino, so you'd expect it to be a little pricier, but it just seemed like it was a premium price for what turned out to be an OK meal.  This is a place to stop by if you're going to spend a night at the casino with friends and want to have something fun and cool to eat before a night of gaming.  It's not a place to stop by after you're done and looking for something casual and cheap to end the evening.I think the 3 stars is generous; the staff made up for this visit being kind of disappointing.  I can see where this place would be appealing; it just wasn't what I had in mind as a visitor.  Now I know better.",1
5,Amazing blow out with Erin.  My hair looked amazing when I left the salon and the next morning looked just as fantastic.  Will be back again!,2

It's true, Aldo's has one of the greatest pizzas I have ever tasted. It's the Brooklyn-Style square pizza. It has a plum tomato sauce and mozzarella. Oh my gosh it is addictive. They also make a mean Stromboli Combo! This is basically a pizza with everything folded over on itself: Sausage, Mushrooms, Peppers, Pepperoni! Amazing!",1

1,"Decided to come by with my niece and girlfriend for late night milkshakes. Let's say from here on out I'll be going anywhere but stargate. When I called in the hostess was rude and seemed annoyed, I was met with the same feeling when we arrived. The hostess seemed annoyed that we didn't want to sit and just wanted milkshakes to go. We were handed menu anyway which didn't even have milkshakes on them. The workers were rude and dirty. I felt like I was in a drug rehab. Not to mention the milkshakes were plain and watery and overpriced. $5-6 a piece. Springfield diner is leaps and bounds better",0

1,"Long time regular of Hooters in the Florida and now defunct Ohio areas and had to visit this one when visiting friends in Arizona.   Ordered a pitcher of beer and 10 minutes later told I cannot have one alone.  That's ok   I remember living in Ohio the Hooters up there never gave someone drinking solo a pitcher   was just policy    even seen same policy in some Tampa stores   AFTER THIS ALL DOWNHILL.   Waitress must have thought we were mad and sent a manager over    I explained it is no problem and I seen the policies before   he then corrected saying it is a state law in a firm tone.  Ok  I was educated   very cool    he then had to be a know it all and tell me that the Hooters ANYWHERE never had a policy about pitcher serving and he knew cause he worked with the company 10 years.   LISTEN  NOW YOU MADE AN ISSUE OF A NON ISSUE,   it was the way they were in Columbus ohio!!!!!   Experienced it many times  I Did not care for the vinegar based hot sauce, and  then mr ""know it all"" had to speak up again saying Florida will be switching soon from butter to vinegar so get used to it.  Have since found from 2 Florida IMPORTANT HOOTERS MANAGEMENT PEOPLE that 1  they will never change over and 2 Other one says they are really fighting it.  The outspokeness of this manager really ruined a visit and overshadowed our very nice and sweet waitress    she was one of twins   cannot remember name though.  Beautiful store just try not to engage manager  #WillRegret",0

The staff was very attentive and friendly and recommended their sunrise mimosa - I had 4! Overall wonderful atmosphere, I definitely recommend and I will definitely be back.",2
4,"After having been here, I would say that the food had great flavors for the taste buds and it was a unique experience.  Our server, Brian was no doubt a foodie... I've never seen anyone get so excited about food and discuss the ingredients in such detail with so much passion.  The food really was different and had unbelievable flavor.  Anyone who calls themselves a foodie should try this place.  I'm thinking they would be pleased with this place.  But, the portions were small.  And I really didn't like the interior of the restaurant.  I'm more of a booths girl.  Booths can be classy, you know?  All in all, I would say this was an interesting place and I would come back, but the dishes were too complicated for me to want to come back beyond once a year.  Speaking of timing, the chefs change the menu every year.  And these guys really are good at what they do.  The owners actually own the Red Pony and two other restaurants all on the same street!  And they're all doing well.",2
5,"We order here with uber eats and the food is fantastic every time. not drowned in sauce, great flavor.",2
5,"I have been to Novo four times since moving to Philadelphia and it is one of the best places I have ever gotten my hair done!  The girls that work there are really welcoming and friendly and do great work.  I had Lauren do my hair and she listened to me and did exactly what I asked and made my hair look fabulous.  Novo is really decently priced for such a good cut.  I was referred by a friend and they gave her $20 off her next hair cut for referring me and gave me a ton of coupons for my subsequent visits.It is so easy to get an appointment here, even last minute.If you're looking for a place in South Philly to get your hair cut you have to go to Novo.",2
4,Interesting place to visit. The lady that greeted us was friendly and funny. Seem like the kind of person you can sit down with and go on for hours. The museum itself educates you about what voodoo is really about and not what you see on a Hollywood screen. Would I go here again? Yes. Would I recommend it to someone? Depending on the person,2
5,"We are staying at the Wyndham and it's just about a 10 minute walk to this little beach bar and grill. We were seated fast, and served delicious food. We had two appetizers, Calamari and Crap dip.

4,Lucy's was great! Mimosa's were fresh and the pulled pork was awesome! Great service and food was wonderful. Menu was extensive !,2
5,We had a gift card and came on a Tuesday night.  The food  was delicious.   My husband had a 12 oz rib eye.  He said it was the best he has had in years.  Alan was our server.  Excellent service.  AND they have cardboard take home boxes.,2
5,Both Dr. Lam and Colleen treated me fantastically in filling a couple of old cavities. They did it quickly and without any pain and with much good humor. I highly recommend this office for any dental work you need done. It's worth traveling to the City even if you don't live there. - Rob S.,2
5,"The Dallas Bull never disappoints! Having been a regular on Thursday nights, we decided to give Saturday a try. The crowd was light in the early hours but it sure got crowded around 11pm. Bar service was decent and I didn't have to wait too long to get a drink. My only complaint is that the new DJ doesn't count in the songs which leads to chaos on the dance floor as many people don't know when to start the line dance correctly. This lead to me getting stepped on quite a few times (which is not fun when people are wearing cowboy boots and think they know how to line dance). Hopefully they will get the DJ to start counting in the songs!",2
4,The people there were super nice. Pizza came out really fast. They have like 40 different toppings to chose from. Pizza was above average.,2

1,"Worst movie theater around!  I am within walking distance and avoid this theater.  I'd rather drive out of town then waste my money going here. Today I decided to give them another try only because there was a free screening being offered.  Gofobo apparently rents space to do screenings at Loews.  I understand it is a separate company.  I understand that they are not affiliated but when you rent space to a company that poorly runs events at your facility it is a reflection on your business as well.  That aside, a little courtesy and  goes a long way.  I do not understand why people with no customer service skills decide to work in a service industry.  How they become managers is also a mystery.   Gofobo offered a free screening at Loews today.  The representative stated that over 500 tickets were issued for the screening.  As a matter of fact, while I was at the theater I was able to see that tickets were still being offered online.  However, after a 1 hour wait (longer for many others) we were told that the theater was full. I do not remember the exact number but the theater held less than 200!  Less than 200 yet over 500 tickets were given out!  Here is where I have an issue with Loews.  I asked to see the theater manager.  I was upset that I had wasted my day.  I had gotten a baby sitter for my infant son and planned to have a day with my daughter.  We went out in the rain expecting to see a movie and after waiting in a line for an hour while peoples purses were searched and a few people were let in at a time we were then told the theater was full.  We were told to leave our email address and we would be issued tickets for a future screening.  I waited for a manager.  What a waste.  The manager, ""Nicole"" was very rude.  All she needed to say was, ""I am very sorry.  I understand"".  Instead she stared at me and only said, ""OK"" in response to everything I said to her.  No Nicole, it is not OK.  It is not okay that my time was wasted.  If you couldn't offer to let us into a different movie how about at least offering some empathy and simply saying I am sorry for the confusion then pass the blame onto Gofobo.  I feel sorry for your staff.  I hope you do not treat them as poorly as you treat customers!  Time to brush up on your customer service skills!  You really do not belong working in management in the service industry.  My past experiences with Loews have been poor.  We were there a few months ago and it was gross.  The floors and cup holders were sticky.  Food spilled everywhere.  The bathrooms were also gross.  This was the second bad experience in a row.  I had said then that I would not be back.  The only reason I gave them another try was because it was a free screening.  In the future, free wont even get me to go back there.  They have permanently lost this family as customers.",0
5,I love this place! They have so many items that other health food stores don't carry! The people are helpful and always cheerful.,2
5,"Loved this office.   There is nothing worse than trying to find a dental office open or willing to work on you on very little notice.  This office was wonderful and not only did I get an appointment very quickly, the front office staff was very polite and personable - as we all know, this is not always the case. I am a dental office wimp and they provided caring service and the procedure was relatively painless (same as other offices I had been to).  I did not feel like anyone was trying to sell me anything which was a nice surprise.  The dentist was wonderful; explained the procedure step by step and made me feel at east and NOT like a number.  The billing went through seamlessly which was a bonus as my regular office there are always billing issues.  I was  pleasantly surprised by my experience at this office as I found them through an internet search.  Thank you Center City Emergency Dentist!!!  I cannot wait to spread the word to all of my friend and family about your office.",2
3,Although the food here is good and have tried their buffet couple of times - one word of caution dont order here from grub hub and then expect your order to be ready when you go for pick up- as i found out yesterday. They dont support grub hub due to non payment. Call the restaurant and directly place your order instead.,1

1,"I had the worst experience of my life and it's not over yet.  I made a mistake in purchasing a vehicle that is out of my budget on a Friday afternoon.  By Sunday after review of my budget I realized I was unable to afford the car.  I called the salesman and tried to explain my situation at 11:30am.  He stated he would speak with his manager and call me back.  At 3:30 after no return call, I called him again, no answer. I left a voicemail and still no call at closing time.  Monday morning I arrived at the dealership as they were opening.  I asked Stephen, the salesman what they determined.  He instructed me to have a seat and he would talk to his management team.  One hour + later, I was called into a cubicle and told my loan had been funded and the title had been changed.  Therefore, I would have to sell the car back to the dealership as a used car.  I would lose a lot of money in doing this.  This morning, Bill head of finance advised that the bank had questions about funding the loan.  I received a call from the bank stating the loan had NOT been funded and they would be unable to okay the loan.  I have left numerous messages with the dealership and have yet to receive a callback.  I contacted an attorney and per his review I again called the dealership and asked for a time to return the vehicle and take back my trade.  Still no response!  These people will lie to your face, avoid this dealership!!",0
5,Delicious Vietnamese food- simple but ample menu- even as a vegan I am spoilt for choice with apps and entrees. My favourite is the Pho- very reasonable price and massive portion so much I get a to go box and have another meal at home! Prompt service even though the place is obviously popular so usually busy. Ginger tea here is really good too!,2
5,"Update. The large, live turtle tank has been replaced with a colorful fish aquarium. I don't know what happened to the turtle. Still recommended. Highly.",2
5,"Wonderful quaint bar with cool clients and an incredibly charming staff. Chefon made me feel so at home. She's beautiful and very funny! She recommended the poutine, mmm. I wish I could stay in New Orleans forever.",2
5,The only reason this is great because of Ben the bartender. Very welcoming. I have been in the business. So I see a worker when I see it. He kept the bar stocked with ice beer and smiles. Very pleasant always smiling. GREAT BARTENDER. I will be back just because of Ben.,2
4,"Stayed here over the last 2 nights and this place is lovely. We stayed in the San Miguel bungalow. It has a very comfortable bed, a small kitchen are with microwave, small refrigerator, coffee machine. The shower has a double head and there is a jacuzzi tub in the bedroom. It was really nice. We had room service for breakfast on the first morning and it was delivered on time and was pretty good. The place is clean and nicely decorated. The main house is pretty and has a nice restaurant. Everyone was nice and helpful when we asked for directions or restaurant recommendations. This venue is close to lots of restaurants, the wharf and shopping, great location.  We are already thinking about when we can plan a return visit.",2

5,This is the best Thai food we have found in Tampa. Hands down. Really great PadThai. Yum. You have to check them out. Excellent food. Can't wait to go back.,2
3,"Food was good. I had the avgolemano soup (almost as good as my mother's, just a bit too much rice in it) and the lamb souvlaki for lunch with a side of horta.  Well executed food, once it came out. However, the service was horrid. I kept thinking Gordon Ramsey was in the back yelling ""Oh come on!"" because the entire, full, restaurant was getting no food from the kitchen.It's really too bad, because for standard Greek fare, they hit the mark.  But even in Greece, the service is better.",1
2,"Lucky Belly was a place that I used to tell people had the best burgers.  I went today and it was not a good experience.  Maybe the chef changed, but I ordered a burger that was supposed to have two thin beef patties (kind of like a glorified Big Mac).  The burger came out with two, THICK, mini burgers.  I'm talking patties that would be considered a lot of meat on sliders.  It made the sandwich extremely difficult to eat so I just gave up.  I asked the waitress if they were supposed to be thin, and she said yes, and that she had told the new cook they needed to be thinner after serving mine. (Why wouldn't she have taken it back immediately and have them remake it correctly before it was served is beyond me).  It was very clear that I was not pleased with the meal, and nothing was offered as a considerate, act of customer service.  My friends burger also had a mustard on her burger which was a totally different mustard than what was explained on the menu.  Like I said, we've been there multiple times before, but this place has just gone down hill.  I am a server/bartender and understand how important a pleasant experience is, which this was not.  Both girls working on the floor were on their cell phones and we had to wait longer than we should have to check out (we were the only ones in the restaurant).  Sorry Lucky Belly, you've lost two customers.",0
4,"It's Firehouse. Always consistent throughout the chain. I like the subs here. My only complaint is with their ice tea. Its way too weak, always. This particular location also seems to be least enthusiastic about the  ""Welcome to Firehouse"" greeting , always but that's ok, gives hubby and I something to joke about when we eat here and we've been coming here since they opened.",2
3,"Went last night for dinner. We had not been there since the casual makeover. I like that the place has opened up, they knocked the wall that separated the bar from the dining area down. I also like that the prices have been lowered. We had early reservations and were seated promptly. Our server was very eager and a little awkward, but at least the effort was there. We started with the guacamole made table-side, which was delicious and fresh. We also had the queso fundido with chorizo and it was addictive! The entrees were a let down, however and that is why I cannot give more stars. At fairly steep prices, compared to apps, I expected greatness. We had the fried chicken with rice and it was bland atop some gummy rice concoction. Just meh. We also had a seafood special that was equally uninspired. I agree with Meghan C. that the margaritas do pack a punch and they are not too sweet, which was good for me. They also have some great Mexican beers on draft - my husband enjoyed a few Negro Modelos. Overall, I think this would be a great place for drinking and snacking, but the entrees are to be missed.",1
4,"Better cookies!!!  Try the Chinese ""Jewish Deli"" cookies.Very good cakes - but priced a bit high.  Need 48 hours notice for large cakes.A good place to know about for sure!",2
1,"Previously, I had rated this restaurant with four stars. However, after today's horrible experience, I can barely even give it a one star. The waitress was fine. The rest, just the worst experience I have ever had at a brunch, the absolute worst! There were seven of us who waited and waited and waited for our food while others who came in after us ordered, ate and left. After an hour and 15 minutes, one of the people in our party had to leave and cancelled her order. The waitress told us they hadn't started on any of our orders at that point. Unbelievable!!!! I told the waitress I was extremely dissatisfied with the situation snd told her to share that with the manager. Truly THE WORST RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE.  I have no intention of ever going back there.",0
4,"Ate lunch here for the first time, and overall it was a good meal at a decent price and it was fast.I ordered the NY Strip Teriyaki Bento Box which came with the NY Strip in a nice teriyaki sauce on a bed of green peppers and onions, with miso soup, a California roll, white rice and a house salad with ginger dressing.  I asked for the steak to be cooked medium rare, and it was definitely on the rare side.  It was good, the cali roll was good and the ginger dressing was... good.  The service was very good and fast.Everything was good, but nothing was spectacular.  So... 4 stars.",2
1,"This review is for the Laura/OakAlley plantation tour. The tours were great but the company can't take any credit. It's the tour guides at the plantation that are So Great! This company has POOR time management issue! After being picked up, we waited for about 20min to wait for the other bus to come then about 20 people were transferred to our bus. By the time we really started the tour, it was an hour after the pick up time. Payment issue - I called about the discount I'll get if I reserve online. The woman told me to do it otherwise I can't get it when paying in person. So I did it. But, then the driver, half way into the tour, said now everyone please line up to pay. He used a tiny portable credit card machine to process everyone's card. It was slow  SLOW! The bus was full that day and it was 90 degrees out. It took him about 45min to get everything done plus he was confused about two groups of people who happened to have the same last name. Really? It's 2013 people! The company can't take payment online or over the phone?  Why ask your customer to waste valuable time? Though I had the email proving I've paid online. I was told that it simply reserved my seats and wasn't the actual payment. So paid AGAIN and of course got charged TWICE! It has been over a week and I haven't got the refund. Because of this delay, when we got to the second plantation, we had about a little over an hour left because the driver said we  must leave at 5.  He told us to go straight to the big house but gave us the WRONG time when the tour would start. So everyone waited about 15 minutes in line AGAIN instead of just enjoying the beautiful garden at Oak Alley. (The tour is boring and the stories aren't interesting. I'd recommend people just spend all the time in the garden) By the time we came out, it was almost time to get on the bus and head back to the French Quarter. So Disapppinting. We didn't get to visit the beautiful Oak Alley at all. Give me my money back, Cajun Encounter!",0
4,"This weird restaurant bar has it going on. A small, simple, delicious menu allows for a greater amount of focus to be spent on making a few foods excellently instead of many foods with medicority, which is an idea some other indianapolis restaurants might want to get in on. Before we went my boyfriend and i did that 'hey, wanna try bites of each others tacos?' thing where we think we'll get two different things and then try each others. I got shrimp, he got chicken and our buddy got pulled pork. I asked my boyfriend if he wanted a bite of mine and he sort of pulled back and said 'no, i mean, obviously we're going to be coming back, so we can just try a different type next time'.Dude loved his chicken taco. And I loved my shrimp taco! I hear the pulled pork tacos were also pretty magnificent. The chips and guacamole were delicious, but for the price I would like a little more guacamole. The spicy rim margarita really hit the spot and was a great accompaniment to the tacos and, at $5.50, i think they were reasonably priced. (I had 5) but what I don't like to see with any margarita is a bartender pulling out a jigger and measuring precisely two jiggers of booze. For that, you get four stars, revolucion. live a little! get me greased up, liquored up, super slick and oil my gears!The fried potatoes were pretty 'meh', but the 'pink death' hot sauce was killer. I think it removed a layer of my tongue while still managing to be flavorful, so that was pretty stellar. So now in a Rocky Dennis fashion, I will break down for you the 'Things that I love'Things That I loved: (the sun on my face)-affordability-deliciousness-freshness-an atmosphere where you go, eat your taco and then sit around for a few hours drinkng because it's just a chill place to be.Things That I Didn't love: (the sun on my face)-Not being a bit loose with the tequila-mediocre tatershaving to wait in line every time i wanted to order another margarita. Like I said, I drank 5 and a daquiri. Every additional margarita meant me waiting in line to order it. That's not so awesome. -THEY WOULD NOT MAKE A MOJITO! get out of here with that!But we will definitely be frquenting!",2
4,"Homemade. Quaint. But the one thing that you must get are THE GRITS! Wow! Best grits I have ever had in my life. So yummy we ordered another bowl. If you have a phobia to cows like you may clowns, take it to go! Serious COW fest going on in here. Enjoy!",2
4,"There were quite a few reasons why I could not give Cheu a five-star rating but it does not include the food. First, Cheu is a small location. There are only three tables crammed into a small nook which should onlyt. Second, VERY limited seating. Therefore, this place does not offer reservations, except in extreme cases, and seating it fills up fast. However, the food does come out at a fast rate so I cannot see why anyone would want to eat, relax and talk for a bit. The noise level is rather loud and the music does not help in that aspect. Besides those little annoyances, Cheu does offer delicious ramen that is worth the wait and crammed area. The secret lies in their small menu that is precise and allows to make ramen a specialty. I tasted ramen from other restaurants and the menus tend to be huge; lots of combinations, food seems rushed and put together; but not here. The slices of brisket in my ramen was lean and non-fatty and the broth was absolutely delicious. Cheu does offer apps as well but you can feel up on the ramen alone; but if you must try an appetizer try the Garlic Wings or/and the Pizza Dumplings.Back to the ramen! I added an soft boiled egg that perfectly complemented the noodles and a Spiked Juice w/ Rum to top it off. Although the noodle bar is pricey the tasty and satisfying dishes makes it worth the investment",2
5,"Not a vegan or a vegetarian but I love eating vegan food. I was so excited to try this place out. It is connected to V Street (which is right next door) so I'm guessing this is the vegan paradise of Philly. Two awesome restaurants right next to each other. So what does that mean? Well, if you're like me.. that means when you are visiting the area and looking for awesome take-out, you just order from both places so you don't miss out! We ordered take-out from V Street, then headed next door to Wiz Kid, where I ordered the WK philly (the vegan version of a classic philly cheese steak). We were originally planning on taking this to our hotel to eat the meals from both restaurants but we decided to snag a table at Wiz Kid and eat our food there. The WK philly was ready under 10 minutes, and we self sat in a cute little table where we indulged in all the vegan goodies. I loved that they had regular ketchup and spicy ketchup as options. I went with the spicy and my mom had the regular. We split the hoagie and were both BLOWN away by the flavor. This was the best cheese steak I've ever had. The bun was so tasty, the ""meat"" tasted like real meat but BETTER because I didn't feel disgusting and overly full after I ate it due to the meat sweats and that gross greasy meat feeling in your tum. The ""cheese"" was so flavorful too! I honestly can't say enough about how good this sandwich was. The service was great too. I would come back here in a heart beat!",2
2,"This hotel is located near the Tampa International airport.  I stayed here last week and have stayed here several times over the past 8 years.  This Embassy Suites is not like most Embassy Suites as it does not have the center atrium.  The hotel is a standard high rise building.  Bad - Parking at this hotel is a challenge.  They have a small garage and the parking spots are very small with extremely tight turns.  If you want to prevent getting your doors dinged, don't park in the garage.  Also, there is no elevator in the multi-story parking garage.  So plan on dragging your luggage up and down several flights of stairs. Good - As with all Embassy Suites they put out a good breakfast spread with cooked-to-order eggs, omelettes and pancakes.  Also, the employees at this hotel are very friendly.In summary, I find the parking situation to be unacceptable and I will choose a different hotel when returning to Tampa.",0
1,"They sat us within 5 minutes and then took 40 minutes to even bring out sodas. The table next to us had the same server and got their good before their beverages came out. After almost an hour there with no drinks we tracked down a manager who told us our good never even got entered. I'm on my honeymoon and the friend we were there with had a date to make. Appetizer was the only thing to make it out and was decent boneless wings. Even with the manager begging us to let her get our food together free and not walk out, the service was beyond dismal and slow. First and last time coming to a Beef's. Made us all late. If we had waited at our table for the food we would have made our year anniversary before it came out. Better choices for food elsewhere. Avoid this place at all costs",0
1,"Very disappointed and NOT RECOMMENDED!We rented a limo for a bachelor party on Friday December 27th. The day I booked the rental they charged my debit card $100 deposit. I received a confirmation via email with pick up address and confirmed via email. The driver was to pick us up at 830PM.  At 9PM I started calling the main number I booked the reservation through.  I talked to a guy who said he would call me right back he had to find the driver.  After 20 minutes i called back.  No answer. I then navigated through the entire phone tree by pressing numerous prompts and finally got an emergency number.  I called that number and got Pam. She said she would find the driver.  Again the same story.  She called back 10 minutes later and said they had to cancel, could not find the driver!  How does a company not know where their drivers are?  How can a company just decide to cancel one hour after they are supposed to be there?  There was no apology in her voice.  Just sorry had to cancel.  Kellys was sure quick to take my $100 out of my account the day I booked. But NOT customer service oriented to cancel before I had to call them! Never again and I tell everyone not to use Kellys in Belleville IL! They could have offered to maybe provide a few hours of free drive time for the local wedding etc. Something to make up for the inconvenience.  But I guess they have so much business they did not care!",0
1,"I have had Pizza hut before at a different location and I don't remember the service ever being this horrible. We ordered delivery. They were late, we called them multiple times and the manager would not come to the phone except on the last try. When he finally spoke to us, he blamed us and said we didn't pick up the phone and that he left a voicemail. I immediately knew he was lying since 1. if he called us the multiple times he said we would have received the call2. if he left a voicemail message THERE WOULD BE A VOICEMAIL MESSAGEDO NOT ORDER FROM THIS LOCATION. THE MANAGER TRIES TO PLACE BLAME ON CUSTOMERS, LIES AND DOES NOT KNOW WHAT CUSTOMER SERVICE IS!!",0
3,"The appetizers are SO en pointe and amazing. Sampler plate was fantastic. That's why the entrees were such a disappointment in contrast.Pad Thai and Clay Pot were kind of gamey and over seasoned.  Maybe other things are better, but if I come back, I'd stick with apps, and order pork spring rolls, crab rangoon (OMG PILLOWS OF AMAZINGNESS), and beef lemongrass.The apps were 4 star, the entrees were 1 star.",1
4,"Lovely people, great food (received rave reviews from guests), excellent service and good planning help.  Being my first time having an event at my home, I was particularly interested in everything going smoothly.  The waitstaff explained what hors d'oeuvres were being passed and were very friendly.  I couldn't have asked for better!  The manager did a great job too.  Unfortunately, the bartender was not familiar with Manhattans or Old Fashioneds, which I specifically wanted.  Every time anyone asked for one she had to refer to a recipe or ask how they were made.  I had requested a specific bartender I had met at another party.  She was guaranteed to be my bartender but she was replaced by another at the last minute without anyone notifying me.  She was available but was pulled off at the last minute for another party.  I was very peeved by this and called the party planner.  They apologized and tried to make it right.  For a cost of $2,200 they reimbursed me $80.  Not exactly wanting my business I guess.",2
4,"Ask for a Fresh Margarita, they are fantastic. Seafood enchiladas are the bomb too. Lots of different tequila at the bar to try out. Great authentic Mexican food.",2
3,"Eh. Visited Carmine's on a weekend trip to Missouri after reading the its reviews on Yelp. Can't say I had the same experience as other yelpers this time around...While the service was spot-on (I don't think my water glass was ever less than 3/4 full), the quality of food just didn't meet my ""steakhouse"" expectations. My brother had the porterhouse. I tried the seafood special - prawns stuffed with crab and grilled. There really wasn't anything ""special"" about my meal or the risotto it was served with. Both were bland. My bad I suppose for ordering seafood in a restaurant known for steaks, although my brother's medium steak came out practically bleeding and was sent back for a second round on the grill. One positive... the toasted ravioli. Yummm! Wish I had just ordered a second plate for dinner.",1
5,"Over the last year I've tried many, many, many things on the menu.  My rating has not changed.First, parking can be a bear.  Despite the numerous parking spaces, it's still gonna be tough getting in and out, and a spot, but trust me, you'll be fine with a little walk to the door.  Get there a little early from the lunch hour or you'll be waiting in line and you'll be looking for a spot to park your butt.Now that you're inside, check out the menu board.  There's nothing I've tried that isn't good, and most things are great.  Fish Taco Tuesday...it should be added to the Outlook calendar as a standard reminder.  Brisket tacos, with BBQ sauce (I add the white sauce too), are splendid.  Tortas, burritos, whatever you pick, you're probably gonna be under $10 with a drink and chips, so splurge for the white, creamy goodness called queso.  Once you've paid, go to the drinks and pick ""Baja Fruit Tea"" as your drink.  You're welcome.",2
5,"Didn't know that this was Blake Sheldon's place. We here for a private party.  The place was beautiful. Love the flow of the chair set up, bar, and stage. Place was also clean and their food was delicious. We had biscuits, mash potatoes, fried chicken, pull pork, Mac and cheese, Brussels Sprouts, and some salad stuff and all were delicious. I love their fried chicken; crispy and crunchy. This place was lively and groovy.  I also loved their live camera and great lighting and sound system.",2

The pizza is a a little thinner, a few less toppings and things like the kids eat for a dollar special is not really a full kids meal nor is is $1.00 ($1.79) I keep going because the service is always great, the location is good, and the half price pizza deal used to be good. Not sure if they are trying to save pennies or there was a change in management.",1
3,"It was an overall pretty average dining experience. The wait staff was friendly but nothing special but we got served very quickly. The location was nice.I had the Cajun Combination (cup of gumbo, small-and I do mean SMALL serving of jambalaya, and red beans and rice.)The gumbo was pretty good. I was happy with it overall. The jambalaya was pretty awful. You're better off making a box of Zatarans.  The red beans and rice were okay. I wasn't unhappy with them but I wouldn't go out of my way.I wouldn't highly recommend but I also wouldn't turn away. I could eat here again.",1

Lena is fabulous; need a nice conservative 'do for corporate america, she got you, need a 3 foot high beehive, giiirl, and HOW.

3,"So located in a strip mall, so nothing exciting there...  The interior is better than the normal nail place, they have a decent decor with a lot of nail techs and they also do massages and waxing.  I was recommended to try Lee and she was friendly and offered me a beverage as soon as I arrive.  She did a nice job on my manicure which was $12.  Everything is very reasonably priced and I would return.",1
5,The beer garden alone is worth 5 stars! When I first came here I didn't realize they have a whole beer garden in the back with so many selections where you can even build your own 6 packs!Love this place! It's definitely my go to for beer now!,2
5,Great experience. Everyone is very nice and doesn't beat around the bush with telling you what your hair needs to look its best. I will absolutely return.,2
3,"Since they don't take reservations on weekends, I wasn't terribly surprised that they had some difficulty accommodating 15 of us when we walked in. To their credit though, we were seated at a 12-top plus nearby 4-top within about 10 minutes.The outside beer garden was underlit once the sun went down, and it was pretty loud once the band started playing. (folksy, bluegrass music) Food and service were good, and I definitely recommend the beer biscuits. However, be aware that desserts are all sized for 4 people!",1
4,"I would give them 5 but I was disappointed by their reuben.  For some reason, I have to order reuben if it is a new place and the place has a reuben on their menu. but the reuben's rye bread was disappointing considering that companion is all about the bread.  However, my fiancee's sandwich(forgot the name) with chicken, bacon, avocado on french bread was amazing!had their spice chicken soup with their corn bread.  It was great! the soup had tons of vegetables and chicken, just the right amount of heat and the corn bread is pretty big and delicious.  their chi latte was not impressive.. do not get it. lol little pricey but, it's a great place to have a wonderful breakfast/lunch and the workers are nice and friendly. check this place out, let me know what you guys think.",2
5,"I would live here if I could.Our first visit we got the lamb sliders, corn and crab fritters, feta fries, and empanadas for dessert. The bill with tip was around $38 I believe.Our second visit we got the lamb sliders, corn and crab fritters, gnocchi, and cream cheese brownie for dessert. Yup, the lamb sliders and corn and crab fritters were so good that we went to Three Muses twice in our one week honeymoon and ordered the same items.Great local music each time we went there. The first time was a jazz trio and the second time was singer songwriter Sarah Quintana.Like I said, I would live here if I could.",2

5,"I loved this place. These tacos were delicious and the salsa options were fantastic. There isn't much to say. You walk to the counter, order the food, get your salsa from the salsa bar, and chow down. If you want street tacos, look no further. You've reached the spot.",2

1,"Aw, man. I was hoping I'd previously posted a glowing review of RuSan's so I could prove that once upon a time, I liked it here. But, I didn't so just trust me on this one.It is with a heavy heart that I relay today's experience over the lunch sushi buffet. Cold, gelatinous, and ~$11/each. It's been a year or three but I remember this being so much better. Don't get me wrong... I love cheap, fast food-ish, ethnic cuisine and I have lovely memories of the Ginger Simmered Beef, Fried Garlic and Bay Shrimp Salad Maki (like I said, once upon a time), but today? Lackluster is an overstatement.With each bite, I kept hoping the next would be better. But, alas. It wasn't. Why, RuSan's? With all your new neighboring restauranteurs in The Gulch, is this the taste of complacency? I shake my head in disappointment because I know your potential and cherish what we once had. On the upside, my water was refreshing and the service was fine.",0
4,"We called to see if a reservation was needed for a late lunch in Saturday. We were told we should be fine and, in fact, there were a few tables open when we arrived around 4pm.  Initially we stood at the host/hostess area for a bit without being acknowledged even though the servers and host(s) looked our way a few times. Eventually we took silverware and menus and sat ourselves.  Clearly reservations are necessary because a family of 4 arrived after us who had reservations and were promptly seated and served drinks before anyone even acknowledged our presence. We finally caught the attention of the host and asked for a waitress.  Once we engaged with our waitress, who was sweet and attentive, everything was great. Our drinks were served immediately followed by orders and soon after, our meal.  The ducks fries were AMAZING! Perfectly seasoned with tender duck and smooth, creamy cheese sauce. My husband had the pork roll burger. I think you may need to go to confession after eating this- it's so good, you feel like you did something dirty!  I had the fried chicken sandwich. Tender and delicious with perfect purple cabbage cole slaw and yummy pickles. I'm sure the hosting issue was just a little glitch and not at all reflective of the attitude of this restaurant. All of the workers were friendly and constantly approaching customers to see if everything was ok or if they needed anything. We were thanked twice for coming in.  The prices were incredibly reasonable considering the quality of the food. We'll definitely go back to try the Mac n' cheese ( which looked just as sinful as the pork roll burger) Maybe we'll try Sunday brunch too, if we can get a reservation!",2
5,Great atmosphere with a large outdoor seating area. Usually great bands. And love that you can pick out your cheeses and they will make a rather large cheeseboard for you! Place can get packed especially if it starts to rain!,2
1,I wish I could say it was not an incredibly unpleasant experience. She was very loud and very rude.,0
4,"It took forever to be seated and its small, cramped and hot inside. On the plus side you can drink while you wait.The server was really cool and very honest when we asked what was good and fresh for the day.The food was cooked fresh!  I mean from being alive in the tank to killed and cooked right behind you. We ordered Lobster and rock crab both were amazing. We also had the lobster bisque which I thought needed more flavor.The beer was ice cold and the food was hot and fresh. Service was outstanding once we actually got seated.",2
4,The service was great and they got us to a table really quick. The flavors were good and tasty. Perfect for a lunch date.,2
5,"So far the most amazing court house I have ever seen. Great for weddings, though beware there are tours going on, and it's open to the public. Probably the most beautiful building in Santa Barbara. If you can go to the tower, you can see the ocean, and a beautiful town. Love Santa Barbara.",2
5,Awesome! Great place. The staff are friendly and met all our needs. Very great energy. Each shake is handmade to perfection like a work of art. If you are diabetic this is a no no for you. It was soooo good! The owner even came out and spoke with customers. She has such a beautiful spirit! So happy we stopped by! We couldn't even eat it all. My recommendation is to share.,2
4,"I like Tsevis because they have good gyros, which is really the only thing it get there. I've had the breakfast buffet there one Sunday, which was pretty good. I liked the omelet station. There is also a bar attached to the restaurant which looks like it can get lively on the weekends.",2
4,Wanted to find a better local Chinese place. This one had few but good reviews. While ordering i felt a bit rushed. I ordered extra spicy general tso chicken with white rice and egg roll combination ($8.50). I also asked for a side of crispy noodles. When finding the place it was not in the location that Yelp provides. It is in the shopping center on county line road and newtown road immediately west on county line. The interior could be nicer. One table and a couple chairs and a fish tank. The menu is hard to read above the counter and is old and dated. While arriving I asked for an order of vegetable fried rice which they accommodated quickly. I also asked for a 2 liter of Pepsi. The packaging was sufficient and the price was around $15 for everything which seemed a little bit high but I was hoping it was worth it. When arriving home and opening the packaging the dishes looked great. The rice appeared fluffy and there was a good amount of chicken and broccoli. Unfortunately my request for crispy noodles was unfulfilled.   The egg roll was a nice size. The chicken was really good although it didn't seem to be extra spicy. The rice was excellent. The egg roll was good although seemed like mostly dough and could've used more meat and vegetables. Overall I enjoyed the meal and recommend the place. The food is better than the appearance of the restaurant would imply. Probably the best I've had in the area so far. Just remember to ensure those crispy noodles are in the bag!,2
5,"Great new brewery in the neighborhood. Took a while to open, but glad it's finally here. Very laid back place. Good service. Delish beer!",2
4,"I have been going to this park since I was a child and as an adult I now hold an annual pass. The pass is well worth it, because it is less than the cost of three admissions. I love the selection of treats in the park. The bakery has fresh baked bread and it is delicious. Old fashioned candy can be found on the midway and in a couple of stores throughout the park. Have lunch in the Hotel Selkirk, the prices are reasonable and the food is much better than the short order place. Try going on a rainy day, the park will be less crowded and the interpreters will have more time to interact with you!",2
4,"Fried chicken paradise in the Treme. This place smells like home-cooked fried chicken before you even open the door and it just gets more heavenly when you walk inside. Briny, meaty, crispy and all of the qualities you look for in a good piece of fried chicken. Like many of NOLA's best restaurants, the interior is nothing special and the exterior is unassuming, but don't be put off. Yummy delicousness awaits.",2
1,Don't get a to go order. You will get a tiny burger and have added gratuity added. Not a good pick at all. My bill for two burgers to go was 40 bucks.,0
4,"First time here and I got the turkey burger bc it was a special. I regret it. Not that it wasn't good but I'm not a big fan of turkey burgers. My own fault. However, the fries were yummy and fresh and like the name of the place is called you build your own burger. I will highly come back here to try their beef burger or salmon burger.",2
4,"I have eaten here many times, I consider it my staple for Greek. Quick easy and consistantly good.",2
4,"My wife and I have been coming to Paradise for many, many years and always have an enjoyable experience. We even had a night cap there on our first date! The staff is friendly and attentive, the food is always consistent, and I believe they have the coldest Anchor Steam on tap in town! My only suggestion would be to add some new items to the menu, which they seem to not do very often if ever.",2
4,"Went to Kampai early on Friday night (maybe 6:30).  Found parking right in front and there were only four tables taken.   This place has, first and foremost, pretty good sushi.  Ambience is pretty standard.  It's on a fairly quiet CWE block  with windows all along the front, so you can watch the parked cars and not many people walking by.  This is not a romantic place at all, but a good place for conversation.  Would be great for a business meal if everyone likes Japanese/sushi.  Probably not a bad place for a group, either. The service was great, then again, it was pretty slow.   Bottom line:  Any place around here with decent sushi is a keeper. We'll be back.",2
3,"I haven't eaten a meal here yet but this is a surprisingly nice place to come for a beer (or 2 or 3) and watch the game. The bar is really beautiful, large and accommodates about 20 taps. There are always drink specials on your standard domestics and some kind of appetizer or two. I've only tried the ""zingers"" and I thought they were pretty disgusting but I'm not opposed to trying other menu items at some point.",1
5,"Wow!  Yummy, different,  delicious.   Our favorite is the lamb curry and korma.  With 10 different kinds of naan!!!  Don't let the outside deter you (because we almost changed our minds)...go in and try something new!   You'll be glad you did!",2
5,Extremely friendly and relaxed experience. Food was equally excellent. The Italian Beef sandwich just like Tony's Italian beefy's in Chicago. Pizza speaks for itself - outstanding. Ellie was our server and couldn't have been nicer. Well done folks!,2
4,"Great spot for watching a game at the bar and has surprisingly good food. Even though it's a chain and a mall restaurant, every dish here is carefully prepared and well-cooked with something unique and memorable about it. I come back here often.",2
4,"The ice is just like Hansen's. Nice and soft and pillowy. They didn't have sugar free wedding cake but I went with the half wedding cake and half orchid vanilla which was pretty good. Added condensed milk. Very happy with it and it was only 2.75 and huge.Recommend this place. I live uptown but may make the trek over here when I don't feel like waiting in a huge line at Hansen's, snow is just as good and half the price.Cash only",2
5,"Do not sleep on the delicious everything covered Oreos at Southern Candymakers!!! I'm so upset that we ate at 4 places prior to visiting and didn't buy more crack cookies to take home. Currently in the car wishing I had bought more!  I know everyone comes here for the pralines, but that's not how I roll. The candied pecans they gave us as samples were also super delicious. Yum!",2
3,"This was my first experience with Caviar's delivery service, who during what I thought was a busy time for Cheu (I walk by all the time, and it's always packed), delivered it in 22 minutes when the estimate was an hour. Crazy! The food wasn't bad, but I hope it's better when you eat in. One day I'll go back and eat in, but not any time soon.I ordered the al pastor dumplings and the miso ramen.Dumplings: You get five. They were a lot smaller than I imagined (like WAY smaller), but it's very interesting to basically put al pastor tacos (my favorite) into dumplings. They were really good, but way too small to be charging $6. Miso Ramen: They send the broth separate from the rest, wrapped in saran wrap to ensure no spills, which was cool. The noodles were a little stiff and stuck together, and there was hardly any meat. This is unacceptable for a whopping $14 (I've had a comparable bowl that was way better and had thrice as much meat as Cheu's for $9 in Chinatown). If this were $8, I would ignore the hard noodles stuck together in a ball and no meat, but for $5 more than the other guy who's better, Cheu is being held to a higher standard.I expected more from Cheu after everything I heard about it. Even if they don't care about the quality of delivery orders and only put effort into eat in orders, this place is way too expensive for what you get. You could find better ramen for cheaper elsewhere.",1
4,"We got the Grilled 3 Cheese sandwich and the Beef Barley soup. They were unreal! The only issue was the price. As good (and homemade) as it was, I had a hard time swallowing $31 for 2 sandwiches and 2 bowls of soup. Just a touch too expensive. If it wasn't so much, I would have easily given it 5 stars. However if you're looking for a good and wholesome meal, give this place a try!",2
3,Food was a bit bland. I didn't feel the taste was worth all the calories I knew I was consuming.,1
5,"The depot burger is so delicious along with the shishito peppers! Perfect food, perfect atmosphere, perfect drinks!",2
2,Very pricey for a small amount. The acai was a little watery and I did not enjoy whole hard chocolate chips in the acai bowl.,0
5,Stopped in when I found themOn yelp. Why drive to the Hill when you have the same great food right here? Had the house salad and the monster Italian beef and sausage sandwich for lunch. Both were excellent highly recommend. I will stop in the next time I'm in town.,2
5,FANTASTIC from the bread served at the table to the dessert. They made me an incredible hot toddy (since it was unseasonably cool and I had a sore throat) and their shrimp and grits made me wish i could have a second stomach so I could eat more!!,2
4,"Outstanding tofu skewers. And the miso Ramen. Two ten Jack, you have your work cut out.",2
4,"With 5 of us and huge appetites, we ordered 14 plates, as well as a dessert of churros with decadent dark chocolate sauce. We were very pleased with the variety and tastiness of all the plates, but the cocktails didn't taste like anything we'd ever had before, and that's not a compliment. The margarita was just too salty (not just on the rim), the old fashioned tasted off, but the mojitos were ok.Our plates included meat and cheese plate, octopus, mushrooms, bacon wrapped dates (YUM!), fig and goat cheese flatbread, pork belly with blackberry sauce, lamb skewer, pork skewer, asparagus, steamed mussels (yummy garlic broth), fried artichokes and fried calamari.",2
2,Service and coffee is not what it used to be. I went every morning on my way into work for the last year. Recently I've been driving further out of my way to ensure a better cup of coffee and that my order would actually be correct.,0
5,This place is the closest thing to southern california taco shop faire in the northern nevada area. The carne asada fries are delicious and remind me of home. Do yourself a favor and eat here.,2
5,"Pad Kra Pao is the most exceptional dish that I have experienced in Nashville's Thai offerings! Fresh ground spicy pork with the right amount of freshly grown (in house) basil with a few fresh vegetables served with rice and a very tasty fried egg. I am addicted and when I am entertaining guests, I feel compelled to bring them to this wonderful treasure of a place. The service is prompt encouraging a diner to enjoy a meal, but to make way for other guests standing at the door. It's not a rushed experience...but let's keep it moving so that others can enjoy this fresh and tasty spot!",2
5,"Symphony nails is just amazing! I haven't even finished my manicure or pedicure and I am already writing this review. They are very kind and if your like me and enjoy a good massage, COME HERE!! Whenever I am in town again for work I will be visiting them.",2
4,"Good food in the French Quarter is hard to find. This is truly good food in the French Quarter! The oysters were delicious! Everything was well seasoned and had great flavors. The hurricane was the best I had ever tasted. Yum! The weird thing is that we were the only ones there at the time for dinner at 6pm. It seemed strange since the food, drinks and service were so wonderful. Good food and no lines in the French Quarter! You can't beat that.",2
4,"The only reason I didn't give this restaurant a 5 star rating, is because of one single pretentious waiter. As a 4 night guest at Hotel Palomar, the location of the restaurant is an obvious plus. The first night of my stay, I met a coworker in the restaurant for a cocktail. When we arrived, the host staff were busy and not available, so we just walked in. The restaurant was not too busy, so we just looked at a small table next to the bar and proceeded to take a seat. A waiter came by and I quickly asked if we could have a seat, before sitting down and told him we'd only be having cocktails. He stumbled on his reply, and in an irritated/in-convinced tone, told me ""I guess it would be fine"" and basically just kept walking mid sentence. My guest and I brushed it off, and started having a conversation while looking at the drink menu. To make a long story short, he was distant and we both got the ""couldn't be bothered"" vibe from him. When it came to the bill, we asked if it could be split due to company transaction policies, and you would have thought asked him for some inconceivable task. We basically spent the rest of our night and elevator ride to our room in shock of the rudeness we had just experienced. Although that situation left a bad taste in our mouth, and the night before we decided to avoid the restaurant, we decided to grab another cocktail and give this place one more try. After looking around and ensuring ""last nights waiter"" wasn't on shift, we walked over to the bar and started looking over the menu. Instantly, the bartender greeted us with pleasant small talk and made us feel 100% welcome. He asked about our day, recommended cocktails and was a completely genuine person. This guy (I think his name was Ben) is an absolute star! He gave us lessons on Whiskey, described how to make classic cocktails, and was 100% invested in our experience. This is exactly what a bartender at a 4/5 star establishment should be - actually he exceeds that. He was kind, funny, friendly and completely redeemed this restaurant/bar from our terrible experience the night before. I also ordered room service last night from this restaurant, and it was amazing. The bacon wrapped dates and chocolate cake are to die for! Great restaurant and amazing bartender(s). Too bad one bad egg could have spoiled this experience.",2
1,"If I could give this establishment less than one star, I would. Over two hours for an appetizer at the bar 2 1/2 hours for 4 out of 6 people to get the food they ordered for lunch. Brutal - oh, and the bathroom was disgusting. I appreciate if your employees don't show up so half of the menu is off the table immediately but tell your customers if you can't deliver any food - and the owner did nothing to make it right in the end - other than to give a half-assed apology - not impressed",0
5,"Amazing, authentic, super delicious food. I know its authentic because my wife is Afghan and trust me, I know about authentic Afghan food. Try their Awshak or Buloni for appetizer and Qabuli pulao or Mutton kabob for main course and top it up with Firni for dessert. Excellent service, clean atmosphere and friendly hosts.",2
5,"The best fried rice ever! Also the best Pho I had while in Nashville. I'm from Seattle so I'm a little spoiled in that department. If you're looking for a good place to try it for the first time or just looking for a good Vietnamese restaurant, GO!",2
3,"This was not the best hotel I've ever stayed at.  But it certainly wasn't the worst.  We were there during the week, and found the accommodations perfectly acceptable.The beds were a little firm for my taste, but we were able to get a two-room suite for under $200 a night on (upper) State St. in Santa Barbara, which is not bad, especially in summer. It's not pretty or fancy, but the TV works and it was pretty quietWe would return again.",1
4,"Just stated trying this place a few weeks ago and I enjoy the food and prompt service. The sauces here is the star, and there are plenty of combination available in term of food choice. I end up getting the same thing, but sooner or later I'll start to try other things. For side dishes, the new balsamic tomatoes are excellent!",2
5,"Tony Ray Baker and his team are amazing.   I am in a position where I need to sell my home for health reasons, and I have gotten A plus service from Tony Ray Baker.   I love my home, but life has mad it impossible for me to  maintain a home due to health issues.   He works over and beyond, and it clearly is his passion.   Sue Pullen steered me to some one to help me buy this gorgeous home.....and I went to her to find someone to sell this gorgeous home.        Tony Ray Baker and his team are amazing, and Sue Pullen.......is as wellupdate....My house was on the market ONE DAY and I have a solid offer.      AMAZING Tony Ray Baker (and team)!!",2
5,Gosh.... I still just love this place.. I moved away but my burger buds remained with whiskey village..,2
4,"We usually get takeout from here, so despite reviews saying the service was bad, it's worth doing takeout as the food is very good.",2
5,"Pros: I was able to make a sameday appointment for both my sister and myself. The woman running the front desk was very welcoming and was expecting us. I had told her on the phone that I wanted a strong deep tissue massage and she hooked me up with a really fabulous young woman. It was one of the best massages I've ever had. I really liked that she asked me what I wanted. She tailored the massage to my needs (neck and shoulders) rather than going through the motions and doing my whole body. My sister and I had massages in the same room at the same time, and it was nice that we could do that. Cons (I'm extremely picky and mostly pointing this out to help Massage Envy, not to dissuade): I did not love how the receptionists are at the front desk loudly making confirmation calls while you're sitting waiting for the massage therapist. But My sister wasn't as thrilled by her massage person. There were only enough hooks for one person's stuff in our double room.Our therapists chatted amongst themselves a bit more than we would have preferred. Overall, highly recommended! I am a member, so I can get my massages at the local member price, which in Tampa is pretty low. It's a bargain for a lovely service!",2
5,We decided to go were the locals eat. We went on a Saturday morning at 8am. Good thing new Orleans doesn't seem to wake up until after 10 on weekends. There was no wait. The food was so good!!!I highly recommend the cinnamon bun freaking blew my taste buds up!!!The Nutella banana cream was delicious as well.,2
5,"Native Chicagoans Paulie and Jade are the real deal. This unassuming, tucked away, modest little shop is exactly what you want it to be and more than you would ever expect. Best Chicago dogs in town - hands down! ""Dragged through the garden"" the right way with all real Vienna Beef products and perfectly balanced. Paulie will keep you entertained with lively conversation, especially if you're talking about Chicago, but all the while slicing fresh vegetables for your order. Depending when you show up, you may catch Jade squeezing fresh lemons for a number of fresh lemonade flavors. Some items on the menu are seasonal, but that's ok because everything is prepared fresh and tastes great, and their prices are so low, you can afford to try it all. Next time you want a real Chicago Dog or an authentic Italian Beef (hot & wet, loaded with giardiniera) and want them to exceed your expectations, don't drive out of the way to stand in the cattle call at Portillo's, come see Paulie and Jade because it is better in every way.",2
5,Extremely impressed. The staff was super friendly. The Gallery was much more detailed of the different phases of his work than I anticipated. Love the movie showing his techniques and creative motivation. Check out the cholla/turquoise floor!,2
2,"2 stars for gumbo, 1 for the blandest, bleakest serving of red beans & rice ever! Really how hard is it to make red beans & why would you serve this NO fare without any seasoning at all? Don't waste time or money on this place",0
1,"STAY AWAY!  TOTAL THIEVES.  The worst customer service I have ever received.  I went to this studio for awhile and enjoyed it.  Then I had to cancel for medical reasons, so I went into the studio, spoke with the guy at the desk and filled out a cancellation form.  They kept billing my credit card, so I went back in and showed them my cancellation form.  The guys at the desk said sorry, we'll refund you.  A week later, the manager calls me and says I'm a liar, that I forged the form, he's not refunding my money, and he's going to keep billing me.  Then he said I need to come back in AGAIN to fill out another form.  I could not believe it.  The manager called me a liar and a forger and pledged to keep steeling my money.  WTF?DEFINITELY DON'T SIGN A MONTHLY CONTRACT!  They might steal your money, too.  Then call you a liar.",0
2,"NEVER AGAIN. This is a so called restaurant that does nothing that a restaurant should other than prepare food, because the rest is done by the patron. Want water? Get up and go across the yard to get it. Want a drink, walk up a flight of stairs and pay cash. Want to sit in a dirty yard in dirty lawn chairs, enjoy yourself. The wait staff is mildy helpful in that they bring you your food after you go to the window and pay cash for it...kind of like New Orleans Hamburger and Seafood, but dirty and with live music (which is nice). It's a one in a lifetime experience for me...just once.",0
2,"Stopped by here since it was across the street from where we were staying. The only reason this place is still in business is because of the location. We were greeted upon arrival and sat quickly...nothing afterwards was quick. It took at least 15 minutes before for someone came to the table to greet us and ask what we wanted to drink. We ordered at that time as well since we had plenty of time to look at menus. I'm a mahi mahi fan so I ordered it as a sandwich and fried with cole slaw. I'll put it this way, I was so disappointed in it I left an entire piece (came with 2 decent sized cuts of mahi) but the breading was the worst I've ever had, the slaw was mayo based not vinegar based as the waitress stated, and it was possibly the most bland food I've ever had in my 38 years of existence. My friend had clam basket that was mostly fries and equally unimpressive. Son had spaghetti that he said tasted like nothing. Daughter had burger that she said tasted fine and she ate all of it. The waitress didn't seem to know much about anything she served and consistently gave two craps about who ordered what. She would bring out something we asked for and would hand it to someone else at the table. She seemed confused as hell. Long story short this place could have been in our building and I wouldn't eat here again. If you see this place full or a good review I guarantee it's from local clientele. I've been all over the world, this isn't even good for local food. If lack of effort had a taste, this is it.",0
1,Walked in and sat down. Some tall skinny bartender gave attitude. I got up and walked out.If the manager is reading this that dude lost you money.,0
5,"The service and beer selection were in my top 5 favorites of all time.  The staff were very attentive and helpful. They helped one another. The food was great from the Kobe sliders to the crab-cake.  When in town, this is my favorite place to go.",2
4,"We've never had a bad meal at Muriel's.  The food is consistently good, the service (especially in the bar area) is always accommodating and top notch, and the atmosphere is perfectly New Orleans.  The bar is a hidden gem (chlid friendly, but please curb your children so not to disturb other people's pleasure.)  We don't visit NOLA without at least one visit to Muriel's.  Dishes of note: best gumbo in the quarter, perfectly simply delicious bread pudding, veggie plate is always inventive, escargot is divine, and those crepes? Amazing.",2
4,"Easy in and out, tellers are great. Generally, don't have a problem with them talking endlessly to customers while there is a line. But sometimes the customer is not prepared or they want attention and they try to stand there and chat even when there are people waiting to do business. Lori is great and I enjoy doing business with her. She has been excellent in helping me close my mothers estate account. She gets MORE than FIVE STARS.But be aware that most things other than taking money our or putting money in the bank require an appointment. Many times I have walked in thinking it was something simple just to find out I need and appointment and appointments get double booked.",2
5,"Oh yeah, and the Deep Sea Red is rich and amazing and it smells like berries!  When they sent me a replacement it was as good as I remember and it was here the next day!",2
4,"I had been to the original Melrose quite a few times against my better judgement. I was in the mood for a burger, so I got on yelp and searched. I was reminded of this location of M.L.Rose. There were more people there on a Sunday night then I thought there would be. It's 21+ after 5, but as far as I could tell you smoking is only allowed outside on the covered patio. You're allowed to sit where you please, so we chose a nice booth. The menu isn't big, but there's plenty of standard bar foods. Wings, nachos, burgers, and fried yumminess. We started with the triple dip which is chips with salsa, guacamole, and queso. The dips were great, but the chips were greasy or cheat. I had the five alarm burger which was supposed to be hot, but was really quite tame. I thought the pie tin of burger and yummy waffle fries was small for $11. The burger was yummy, just dry and small and not hot. My dining companion had the sweet tea chicken sandwich with waffle fries, which she said was good. Service was odd. At the beginning of our meal out server was great and attentive. After getting our meals she kind of disappeared. 3 of our 4 drink glasses were empty for a while until we were able to flag her down to ask for more. A few minutes later another server brought them. Our server came by once more to pick up what was left of our food but left before we could ask for our checks. We were just there too long. There were a few TVs where we were sitting, but none of them were big. I saw corn hole outside. I heard skee ball behind me, which I would play next time I was there. I'm sure there's also darts and I just didn't see them. I believe they have trivia one night and 2 4 1 burgers one night. I would be back and probably try another burger. Great addition to the area, made better with all of the parking available.",2
2,"The service was the most outstanding part of our visit. The pizza, however, was a bit mediocre. We ended up paying $55 for 12"" deep dish, one beer and 2 glasses of sangria (including an 18% tip.) It didn't feel like a fair trade once we left the building. I ordered ground beef and green peppers on my half and was left wishing I had also ordered cheese, as there was barely an ounce of it on the pie. If you're prepared to drop half a bill on pizza, make sure your expectations are proportionately average.",0
5,"My fiance and I come here pretty regularly as we live right down the road. We've always had good experiences. The servers are nice, the food is good and it's served pretty quickly. There are better Mexican restaurants in Indy, but this is one of the better in Avon/Brownsburg area.",2
4,"This store is amazing.   I stopped going to Walmart a year ago because they treat the employees like crap, they are underpaid, and most don't have health insurance.   Yes....it is CHEAP......but at what cost.    So I needed another store.   The difference in the customer service alone is worth it     GREAT floral section, amazing fresh fruit section, and the baked and organic breads are so good,    With the app on your phone, when you go into the store in registers what you usually buy, and you get great deals on that.    Sometimes it gets you out of your comfort zone with things that are new.   I love it.",2
3,"We went here on the recommendation of some friends. It is not in the best neighborhood but that seems to be the state of most of greater downtown Reno. As the name implies, it was once a train station. The central area is a brew pub. The dining area is a separate room away from the pub.  It is a bit quieter in the dining room but noise from the pub is noticeable. The food is very good. My wife commented on how good her burger was. It was hot, a bit greasy, and very flavorful. I liked my fish and chips but will probably get a burger if I return. If you are young and enjoy craft beer, this just might be the place for you in Reno. Me, I am a few decades too old for this scene.",1
5,"This place is gorgeous! It's got everything: super friendly staff, very delightful atmosphere, and most importantly, extremely creative and amazing food! And the complimentary appetizer and dessert had made my day. Truly enjoyable moment!",2
5,"Catering probably deserves more than two dollar signs ($$) but it is worth the money. Good vegetarian options. Delicious food with gourmet presentation. Entrees, appetizers and sides were all delicious.",2
5,Great place to brunch! The food is so damn delicious and the biggest perk for us is parking! There is indoor and outdoor spaces available but we always do the outside in the summer. The  view from the patio in the back is great bc you overlook kelly drive and the river.,2
5,"One of the best restaurants I've been to in a long time. They had dinner"" specials"" that were more than enough for the. The food was EXCELLENT. The service was even better and the chef came out and brought our dessert and introduced himself to us. . Can't wait to go back",2
4,Food is creative and original. Wouldn't think so but the portions are very large. I would give 5 stars but the service has been inconsistent the 4 or 5 times we have been there. If you like Mexican but are tired of the same old stuff give this place a try. A bit more expensive but worth the experience.,2
2,"Hubby and I were looking for a fresh seafood restaurant and stopped here late on a Saturday afternoon. I ordered the tenderloin because I miss the good midwestern tenderloin sandwiches. For those. not from the midwest where breaded tenderloin was originated I'm sure they considered it great. BUT it was breaded with a much-too-garlicky seafood breading, NOT cracker crumbs as that are meant to be. I tasted that breading for hours afterward.  The fries were pretty good, however. The biggest problem is the restaurant was nearly empty and yet it took nearly 30 minutes to get our food.  Our waitress was very friendly but didn't apologize for the delay.",0
5,"So thrilled to find this delightful shop! I purchased a kit with yarn and pattern, but had some problems with the directions. A phone call to the store cleared them up quickly by the helpful lady who answered. Awesome.",2
4,"Quiet, good service, good fish, standard (boring and tasteless) app and salad, nice decor, good menu. Would go back. Would avoid the salad. Happy hour M-Th 5-7 drinks and appetizers.",2
2,"Food looked good.  Nice decor.  Hip crowd, and crowded on a Tuesday - portends good things.  I just thought no room at the bar, no music, just chatter.  Not inviting - so we left.  I'll try it again. But for now, no go.",0
5,"We had dinner last night at Masami in Drexel Hill. We were the only people there and I was little concerned but more people came in during our dinner. The service and food were very good and loved the BYOB. We had Fried Calamari, Soft shell crab, Bar B-Q Squid, a couple of ala carte sushi pieces and 4 special rolls. All the food was very good and we will be going back. Saves us a trip into town for some good Japanese food and sushi.",2
5,"I love this place. Been three times for their chicken drunken noodles. Came once with a friend who likes his pad Thai and...something else. Their lychee iced tea is good!! Sometimes they have fresh baby coconut that you drink from and then scrape the meat out of--SO GOOD. It's run by a really nice, friendly family.",2
5,"We ate at three places in NOLA over 36 hours. Lunch at Muriel's ruined us for anywhere else. There was no mediocre or bad, only good and awesome. Awesome - the gumbo. Hands down, best gumbo I've tasted in years. My wife had it and it was difficult to not steal her bowl. I had the lunch special which came with the soup of the day. Today was a crab bisque. The bisque had no meat in it, but it was delicious with plenty of flavor. I had the blackened catfish. Look in the dictionary for what I had because it was textbook blackened catfish. Excellent. Served with spinach and potatoes.  The good- My daughter had the pork chop, which might have been the disappointment. The chop was flavorful, but a tad dry. That could have been avoided.  The red beans and rice it was served with was terrific.  My wife's spinach salad looked good too. We spent less here for lunch than we did for dinner at the Red Fish Grill. Wish we had gone back for dinner. If you go, poke around the building. It's full of history and very cool.",2
4,"Very cute and quaint inside, of course what else can you expect from a location inside Eagle Village! The service was very good and the food was good too. Overall I had a very pleasant brunch experience with my friend.",2
4,I love this place. They have the best chicken gyros and gyros. Their pasta salad and is awesome and so is their hummus. Love the mural on the wall. I have eaten here about once a month for the past two years. Usually my in laws ordering to go and someone picks it up and brings it home. always awesome. Never a bad meal. BUT i would really suggest to the owners / workers for everyone to work on their customer service and attitude. Hence missing a star. A couple of times I have walked in 10 minutes before they close to get a to go order - they seemed annoyed. Other than that this place is ACES! If you go get the chicken gyro with a salad of pasta salad. go good! Everything is always crazy fresh tasting.,2
3,Good food...set grille side.....cook was a little low on energy and I felt rushed to leave around the 9:30pm hour and they close at 10pm,1
4,"While housesitting for my mom, I recently revisited one of the top pizza places of my childhood. One of our favorite things was the hulking, pizza box filling, cheesesteak stromboli. One large stromboli could readily feed my family of five. Memories did not dissappoint, the cheesesteak ingredients folded within pizza dough was perfect, crisp dough on top, moist meat inside, and a greasy bottom toeing the line of guilty pleasure.Their cheesesteaks are equally excellent, but the pizza can be disappointing, nothing really bad about it, just that there are better pizzas nearby. They have excellent wings, and for those who want to avoid the mess they also have ""wing dings"", fried breaded wings with hot sauce on the side. It's probably a good thing I'm not commuting from Ardmore station, because if I was I'd be eating here weekly.",2
4,"This is a super interesting place. First off, it is essentially outdoors dining (so don't come here when it is bad weather. Aside from the burgers (which is good in it of itself), the thing to get is its different varieties of smoked fish. Now be warned. If you don't like smoked fish, this is not for you! Now the smoked fish is simply amazing. It is smoked to perfection like you won't believe. The sides are also exciting and fulfilling.Oh and yes... this is one of the best key lime pies I have ever had in Florida either.Just be warned... they close at 730PM so a bit inconvenient. Also, make sure you get the fish that suits you. Every fish tastes different.",2
1,Place is horrible. They make it look on the website like it is a made to order deli but we disappointed to find this morning that it's actually just a couple day old sandwiches in a refrigerator and a bunch of random other crap. On top of that the sandwich was ass.,0
4,"I just moved to NOLA from Houston and was lamenting the lack of good Mexican restaurants to my friend when he suggested this place. SO glad he did! The queso was SO good...I filled up on that before we got our main dish. I ordered the seafood enchiladas and while they were good, they use a red sauce instead of a cream sauce. I would have preferred a cream sauce but these weren't bad at all. My husband ordered beef fajitas and those were good, too.I had a few margaritas and huh....that's funny. I really don't recall much else about the place.Oh yeah! It's good for groups. There were 6 of us and we all sat around a table laughing, cutting up, drinking the strong, strong margaritas, and eating the delicious queso.  Good service, good food, good times. I'll definitely be back!",2
3,"I really enjoyed my visit at Honeys for brunch today. The environment was very homey and the service was more than helpful. This review is mostly based on the food that I get was more or less - subpar. I ordered the eggs benedict with a side of grits; I had no complaints with the meal but it wasn't life changing either.  My friend got the country fried steak with a side of eggs, home fries, and a biscuit; I also tried her food and concluded that the home fries were very well seasoned and delicious. The biscuit was pretty sweet for my liking, but my friend enjoyed it well. The country fried steak, however, is why I had to down a star - while the batter was delicious, the steak was over-battered. My fried had to really dig into the steak to slice me a piece. The steak itself was a bit tough and took a while for us to chew and swallow. We shared a side of mac and cheese and a pork sausage. The mac and cheese was very creamy, cheesy, seasoned properly and close to perfect. I wasn't a big fan of the pork sausage, since it was on the sweeter side. OVERALL, this is a brunch place worth trying. I would not write this place off my list, and would definitely come again - but would just order and try something different.",1
3,Best pizza everWorst service thoI still keep coming because the pizza is still go but be ready to wait a hour or more and to wait in a long line for a refil of soda On a slow night it's awesome no complaints,1
3,"We ordered the Cajun burger, crawfish Alfredo, shrimp po boy and kids chicken tenders. The burger was well cooked and had good flavor. The Cajun crawfish Alfredo was not spicy and that was a little disappointing and pricey. The Shrimp po boy was good. The chicken fingers had good chicken chunks and a seasoned batter.",1
5,Thai Fusion is hands down the best Thai food I've ever had - and it's just right around the corner from my house! The service is excellent and the staff is incredibly friendly which definitely bumps them to the 5-star rating.,2
3,"Was in town on business so why not.The burger itself was cooked to med-rare perfection the whole patty through, which makes me wonder if they sous-vide it and then give it a quick sear.   The meat itself, while quality, lacked proper seasoning. Foie gras has absolutely no business adorning a burger that also contains such overwhelming flavors as bleu cheese and bacon.  Or even a burger at all for that matter.  Its ALMOST as dumb as the concept of a kobe burger.  In any event, it's a gimmick thats worked well for this restaurant, to be sure.  I took mine off and ate it separately. It was delicious and i recommend you do the same if you want to taste the extra $12 or so you are spending. The deviled eggs were a pass. Nothing you couldn't replicate with google search and an ability to properly boil eggs.",1
4,"Wow, what a bargain!!! I have been disappointed over and over at high priced, pretentious Italian restaurants that may serve a lot of mediocre food, but will also kill the old wallet.  Caruso's is exactly the opposite, the portions are good and delicious, the ambiance is amazing and the prices are fantastic.  I cannot explain how great I felt to have a $4.00 glass of wine and a $10 Caruso special (meatballs, ravioli's and spaghetti).  Good food, good service and great prices this is a recipe for success... no wonder they have been around so long.  I will be coming back on my next visit to Tucson.  I highly recommend anyone in the area or just visit to stop on by.",2
1,"Went with a party of 8.  Food was good.  Service was a disgrace.  Arrived at 830, main course didn't arrive until 10:30.  Waiter was setting tables instead of accommodating our already aggravated table.  To hold us over at one point a solitary salad was brought out for one of the eight people at the table.  When main course was brought out 7 of 8 people received their entrees.  Last persons entree was a shrimp dish and when it arrived 20 minutes after everyone else's the shrimp were raw.  Shocking service!",0
5,"I come here all the time to get my nails done, they have such a large selection of colors for gel manicures.  Everyone who works here is so nice and accommodating. They remember me every time I come in and how I like my nails to be shaped, it's great!! Def would recommend",2
4,"Jackson's is the probably the best hang-over brunch cafe in Nashvegas! They even have a plate called the hang-over cure or something like that. They also have a good variety of options for food per their menu is the same throughout the day, night, shhhhiiit all day, every day! =] I've had a good amount food there and they're all pretty good. One thing that was questionable to me was one of their dessert. I forget the name, but i think it was fried cook dough egg rolls? Some peeps like it, but there were several of us not really feeling it, so it's a toss up. The ambiance of this place is the patio looking at the corner of 21st and Belcort. The patio is especially nice Spring-Autumn, it doesn't matter what time. I've also chilled inside, but the real spot is the patio. Inside, like many other bars in Nashville, is smokey. I just can't deal w/ second hand smoke, it makes me sick. =PIf you stick to the patio you'll have a good time. It's a great place for people to eat, drink, chill, and people watch. Now is a great time to go and enjoy Jackon's. so... enjoy~!",2
4,"If you're looking for atmosphere, go somewhere else. If you're looking for giant saucy chicken wings (for a good price) and great NY Style pie, this is the place. I was pretty surprised. I got a slice and 10 wings for $11 which I think is cheap. Try the teriyaki.",2
4,"Casino Del Sol is a beautiful, newer establishment. The rooms are nicely decorated, the beds are comfortable and if you can get a view of the pool / mountains... you'll be impressed. There are plenty of dining options for a 1-2 night stay (The Tequilla Factory was our favorite). Didn't win any money, but we had a great ""stay-cation"". Staff was friendly, however, it was impossible to reach the front desk (we had to call from a cellphone). 4 Stars ****.",2
3,"I originally gave b.good a 4 star review and it was basically: If you're in the market for a burger, salad, or kale/quinoa bowl that's made with real & not-processed ingredients, go to b.good. I also gave them props for the fact that even their sodas and condiments didn't have HFCS or artificial ingredients. I was disappointed that the value of the meal seems a little lackluster, being quite pricey for what you get.I have to knock this original review from 4 stars to 3 stars though because b.good is consistently slow in getting your food ready for you and the friendliness of the service is typically iffy, depending on who's serving you though. And yes, I know you can do online ordering to help with the wait times but as far as I'm concerned, there's no reason why you should have to do online ordering for 'fast food'.As far as I'm concerned, b.good is trying to market themselves as real fast food. The food is real, but it's definitely not fast, and I don't know if it warrants the prices they're charging with the service they provide. That and considering how there are so many awesome/similar eateries in that shopping center already (like Zoes Kitchen, Chipotle, & Panera Bread), it's hard for me to keep b.good at a 4 star.",1
5,Big shout out to Cecile for helping us load our plywood as we got ready for IRMA. Thanks so much!,2
4,"I have been going to this studio for almost four years and have been quite satisfied with it. They offer a variety of classes including yoga, pilates, zumba and many more. I go here mostly for yoga and I think the teachers are fantastic. The Saturday morning class with Kim Kaplan is one of the best. My only suggestion is that some of the yoga teachers could use a wider variety of poses. There are so many out there! Overall, a great studio.",2
2,"The stylist was friendly and knowledgeable. Both my cut and highlights turned out looking good, but not mind-blowing. When I saw all the 5 star reviews I thought perhaps the extremely high price would be worth it. However, after going here I realized the services are really not better than my usual place (which was closed for the week before my vacation so I tried here) and literally WELL over double the price. I honestly just don't get the hype, I left there with pretty nice color and a decent cut but I won't be back since I can get the same cut and color pretty much anywhere (and at my usual place save a boat ton of money.)",0
1,We ordered from SB menus therefore we expected it to take a long time. It took over two hours and I got a voicemail from the driver(on accident I suppose) swearing about the delivery. She was also very rude when she finally delivered the food. Plus the food was gas station worthy. Will never order here again.,0
4,"I Came here a few times for drinks and food. This place plays music at night so that's a plus for me. I was very impressed by their salsa, I'm pretty picky about my salsa, comes in right spicy level where you have to keep eating otherwise your tongue will burn.  Their outside seating is very enjoyable during the summer/fall/spring seasons.",2
4,"Nice intimate bar, but still in the middle of the action in the French Quarter. We stopped here during Mardi Gras week after wandering and it was a pleasant surprise. The bar has an old Southern Upscale feel. Drinks are a little pricier, but the cocktails are well crafted. Stop here if you are looking for a different scene than the usual loud bars around Bourbon Street. I recommend the Near Beer #1!",2
5,"Had the daily special, blackened ribeye I think it was, delicious steak, cooked and seasoned perfectly. Mashed potatoes were absolutely delicious. When I want a good steak, this would definitely be my choice. I haven't been able to find a better steak.",2
5,"The grooming services were excellent. The groomer was on time, polite and did a fantastic job with our dogs. I love the convenience factor and the fact the dogs don't have to be crated for hours like a typical grooming facility. These guys come straight to your house and plug in and groom. I would highly recommend them if you're looking for a groomer in T-Town.",2
5,"All 4 dinners were delicious. Chicken, swordfish, mahi and grouper. Amazing atmosphere.....watching the fish......very relaxing. Our server Chastity was pleasant and helpful. I would definitely go again and I would recommend it.",2
5,"We came here based on the recommendation we received and from the street it doesn't look like much. But when you sit down and you scan the menu you will come to realize that this place serves nothing but home-cooked comfort food. We had the BLT and it was packed full of flavor, they didn't scrimp on the bacon and the vegetables for very fresh. With the sandwiches came some of the best french fries that we've had, and some of the best coleslaw that I've had in the state of Florida. We took a couple of pies home and they were delicious. We will definitely come back.",2

1,"Lame waitress!  I came to watch 10 mins of a game before catching my train. The bartender asked if I wanted a drink. I said no, just catching the game. He was cool. The bar was barely 1/3 rd full and slow.  So I quietly sat at a high top and a waitress came by and asked if I wanted a drink. I said I had a train in 10 mins etc. She said I couldn't sit there and had to leave the bar.  Huh? I looked around and saw half of her high top tables were empty.  I was dressed like the other patrons and was about to leave anyway.  I said why? I'm not taking someone's seat. She got prissy and said they were the rules. Really??? I get it if it's busy. Or if you have a homeless person stinking up the bar. But seriously, I'm just some dude sitting there quietly who's about to leave. That's an issue? Will be avoiding this bar for 2015.",0
1,"This is the worst service I have had at a restaurant in Philadelphia. First, they charged myself and the rest of my group a $5 cover, but then proceeded to seat us outside. The server forgot about us and we eventually were able to put our drink orders in. When they came,  we had lower than average margaritas and sangrias. I wouldn't come back here again.",0
1,"My fiancé and I went to Spraga last night..needless to say it was our first and last time dining at this establishment.  We were pretty pumped to go here since we live right down the street and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves at Fat Ham a few weeks ago.  The food was good but not show stopping.  My major issues were with the service.  1 word.  Unbelievable.  We spent $180 on 2 people.  When you spend that much money on a meal.. You expect perfection with food, service and ambiance.  This place underwhelmed and now I have to deal with my fiancé who is still raging with last nights experience.  Thanks Spraga.Issues:1.  Soups came before cocktails.  I finally had to ask a manager where our cocktails we're because it so long.  - not in my world if I'm paying $180!  2.  First course came while we were still eating our soup..so we had 2 plates in front of us on a cramped table.  Hello serving 101 at like the most basic restaurant in the world..Don't bring the next course when people are still eating their first!  Again I would expect shit like this to happen if I were at TGI Fridays but I wasn't at TGI Fridays.  I was at SPRAGA.4. The waiter tried to remove plates while we were still eating from them.  Say what?  Not when I'm paying $180 on a meal son!  You leave the plate until I am finished!5.  The waiter would awkwardly come to the table and just stand there.. Obviously we know he came to take our food order or dessert order but you say "" Is everyone ready?.. I'd like to take your order"" etc.  WTF.  Nope he just stood there... Weird!  6.  Empty glasses/butter dishes left on the table throughout the meal.  Sloppy.  The server tries to take plates we are still eating from but leaves sangria glasses etc for the entire meal?  I just.  Don't.  Get it.  All in all food was good, not amazing and I've had better service at Tangier.  If you are going to spend that much money go somewhere else.",0
5,"I was trying to find a decent place for dinner tonight for my moderately health conscious self when I came across this place. After figuring out what I wanted and put the Be My Bison burger in my cart for the online order, I realized it would be over a two mile round trip excursion from my job. Defeated, I started to search elsewhere but I could not get that burger off of my mind. I came back a few hours later and submit my order. I hiked it there and it just came out of the kitchen as I walked in.  I grabbed my burger and continued on my way back to work. O-M-G! Absolutely in love with this place. It has been quite the task to try and find healthy places that fit my diet but this is a dream come true! Thank You!",2
5,Awesomeeeee place. Came here with friends at 5:30ish for dinner to beat the crowds. The place is so cute and we loved the logo. We were seated immediately. The waitress was superrrrr friendly and helpful. We got the cheese platter called Ben's bread spread to split for the appetizer. Ohmggggg soooo tasty. Homemade honey and delicious cheeses and the bread was excellent. It was out of this world and worth getting. My sister and I then split the pizza with the spicy Bianca pizza. We couldn't even finish it all after that appetizer. Sooo delicious with the peppers and cheese and thin crust. We also couldn't resist getting a whoopie pie and brownie for the road. This place is a gem!,2
5,"If you are hip and into Mid-Century Modern goods - and being green, you have to check out TFA.It is like a big ball of Mid-Century Furniture, Clothing, Jewelry and what-cha-ma-call-its all in one place. It is a great place if you are looking for that truly unique gift. We have purchased several items and we love visiting!  They are super nice and very helpful.   It's too bad my friends in Cali can't enjoy this place - they would eat it up.",2
4,"I've been attending this place for a while.  I stop here for lunch before going to my drum lesson. I haven't tried everything on the menu, but what I have tried I like: the pulled chicken sandwich and yesterday, a very excellent brisket sandwich.  (I definitely agree with Jesse. M on that.) In addition, the potato salad that goes with hits the spot. Above all, the servers Julia and Amanda are great along with the manager Rick.  They serve the food fast and in addition, are very friendly, very personable and really go out of their way to make sure your time is enjoyable there. Now some are complaining that this isn't the best BBQ food.  Well, we are in Cherry Hill, NJ, not Texas, where I had the best BBQ food in my life. And its not like we have tons of BBQ places lying around. But the food is good enough and if you are hungry for BBQ food, this place will do.",2
3,"Went to this place last weekend, I ordered some Kathi-rolls and the chicken pizza.The kathi-rolls were really good, but the pizza was pretty bad. The location was really horrible and it is street parking which is awful.It is a good place to order kathi-rolls for take out.",1
5,"I am very tall, and like many tall people, have had more than my share of back issues. As such, I've gone to a dozen different chiropractors over the years. Jester is my favorite, and will be yours also.The staff are very friendly and welcoming, and they go above and beyond to make sure that your insurance, scheduling and time waiting are comfortable and easy.The doctors are top notch with both their ability to help you, their easygoing bedside manner, and the fact that they don't sign you up for an extremely long ""plan"" that requires you to get ""healthy"" for a minimum of 30 visits in the next 4 months... from years of experience with them, you can trust these guys. So, a doc that you can trust, that has a great staff, and with an easy manner... all good things, right?",2
1,"extremely bad customer online support. only new vintages that is why they are cheap.they are not interested in building long term clientele. their shiiping methods are terrible to say the least.will never used them againxammiami, florida",0
4,"Loved this place! Possibly the only cheap option for a sit down dinner in the French Quarter area. And the vibe, for my Rochester friends, is a Nawlins version of Nick Tahou's, and I mean that in the best way, of course. AND, for those who know, I'm talking about the 1970s, downtown Nick's, not today's suburban version (take your styrofoam and shove it!)Anyway, we split a platter and got an extra cup of file gumbo and it was plenty of food for the two of us. Loved the gumbo and especially the red beans and rice. We'll be back!",2
2,Very disappointed.... food was only ok.... waitress was not to be found.There's way too many other great restaurants in New Orleans to settle for a place like this.,0
2,"This place used to be fantastic! But since the smoking ban, the management is acting scared. Perhaps it is a necessary business model to charge for an extra clean plate upon which to share our items with eachother, but it feels greedy. The food is great. The drinks are great. The service is hit and miss.  We have had some great servers who are attentive, happy, kind, helpful. But we have had some who seem to be too busy hanging out in the bar to be attentive to the dining room. I would give this place 5 stars if not for the poor service at times, and the charge for an extra plate. So if you dont mind some of the servers who seems like they dont care about your needs, and if you dont mind paying a couple of bucks to use an extra plate, then you might like this place.  We have been going for decades, but not so much now that the service is lacking, and the greed(fear) has set in.",0
5,Someone must've known it was birthday because The Voodoo Bone Lady herself was our tour guide for my group! Me and my group did the 8 o'clock in the evening 5 in 1 Haunted tour. The Voodoo Bone Lady demonstrated great knowledge in the haunted history of New Orleans. She was also very funny and entertaining. I also loved how she handled a major distraction (a huge wedding party second lining down the middle our tour) which she turned around an included some history of that. My group and I had such a wonderful time. I highly recommend this tour!,2
4,"I did not purchase my car (a 2007 Prius) at this dealership, but I have always taken it here for service.  Their service department is great.  They can almost always get me in quickly and their clean and roomy courtesy shuttle takes me to and from my office, making all of my maintenance visits convenient and painless.Most recently I have worked with Bri and Gina as my service advisors.  Both of them do a great job explaining what will be involved in an upcoming service and how much it will cost.I had my car in for service today, including a scheduled recall item.  Gina carefully reviewed the maintenace history from my past several visits when I checked in, and she discovered that I had paid (alot... $400+) to replace a part that had since become a warranty-covered recall replacement.  She informed me of this, and that since this was now a recall item, that I would be able to get a reimbursement for my earlier replacement charges.  She also took time at my checkout to prvide me with all of the backup paperwork that I need to submit for and obtain the reimbursement.  Gina's excellent service this afternoon is a great example of the overall excellent service that this dealership's service department has consistently provided to me over the past five years.I always get a follow up call after a service appointment and Toyota asks if I would rate the service as ""excellent"" and in every case I can honestly answer ""YES"".",2
5,"Had dinner at Marti's for the 5th time in 4 months and it was delicious once again. Their food speaks for itself and you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The service is beyond all expectations! The weekend hostess (We are usually there on the weekend) Lauren greets everyone by name and is so gracious. Our server, Joe is extremely attentive and friendly and makes wonderful suggestions. The General Manager, Chris, is in the dining room during service and talks with each table. He also makes a point to know your name and shake your hand. We had the pleasure of meeting Chef Drew on our last visit. Awesome young chef! I can't wait to see what he is planning for the Fall Menu! Marti's is our favorite restaurant in the Quarter!",2
2,Must have changed management. I go about twice a month. Last two times pasta was under cooked to point of being crunchy  sent it back ask for another which never came. Then they screwed up hot dog order.  Then didn't take sent back dish off check. Finally got it removed from bill paid & left.,0
1,"Absolutely terrible. We had a larger table of 8 and went on a Saturday night. The food was overpriced and not good. One in our party ordered the salmon and she asked for it to be cooked thoroughly in addition without prawns as this is an allergy. When the fish came it wasn't and it had no flavour and had the prawns. She then asked for it to be done again. They came back again with the wrong order. Then she was patient and asked they took TWO HOURS to come back out with her meal. This is not an exaggeration. In addition the server was not very understanding and did not offer her anything while she was waiting. Oh and they still made her pay full price. I used to work in the industry and when you have a screw up of that proportion, that person should not be paying for their meal. 3 other people at the table hated their meal and did not eat it. In my experience as a server and I've seen other restaurants do this, if a customer does not even touch their food, you should inquire at the very least. My meal in particular was ravioli and tasty but my goodness such a tiny portion. Wouldnt fill  up a 3 yr old. For the amount of money you pay this was a terrible experience! In addition they came out with duck pate and some of us chose not to eat it and they were quite annoyed questioning why we didnt eat the duck and how it cleans you palette! I couldnt believe it, we didnt even order the duck! Won't be back.",0
4,"I'm a big fan of this place.  It's a fun sports grill with a TV in view from each seat.  Their wings a great, their burgers are delish, and who doesn't love crinkle fries?  I've been several times (including lunch today) and the service is always good.  The prices are very impressive, especially for Brentwood.  My burger and fries were under $8.",2
4,Great seafood. Had 1/2 shrimp and 1/2 oysters. The meal arrived at the table hot from the fryer.  Seafood was FRESH. Some of the best fried oysters I have had in a very long time beside Mike Andersons in Baton Rouge. I'll. E back when in Kenner again.,2
5,"We had dinner here after a long day at the convention center.  We asked to sit in a quieter area, and they found us a nice table in a side room.  Service was attentive and professional.  Our waiter recommended the aged ribeye steak--""best steak ever.""  I didn't think I wanted an entire 18-ounce boneless, so he suggested we split it.  We did--certainly one of the ""best steaks ever""--cooked perfectly medium rare and it was plenty for both of us.  Of course, we also had the signature shrimp cocktail (horseradish) and the iceberg lettuce wedge with crumbled bacon (very pancetta-like).   OK, iceberg wedge isn't the most exciting salad, but it's great when done well, which this was.     My only disappointment was a wine list that had a very limited choice of medium-priced wines by the bottle, so wine selection took a while.  A small complaint, so I would rate H & I  4.5 stars if possible.",2
4,"Mangia, Mangia, Mangia. My partner and I just had a nice dinner here on a rainy Friday night. We started with a delicious bruschetta and then moved on to a homemade chicken tortellini soup smothered in Parmesan cheese. Delicious and genuine. I had the seafood risotto with new Zeland mussels, bay scallops, and lobster tail which was very good. Slight bland, but all in all very delicious. Jim had the grouper Francoise which he also enjoyed. Flavorful and intriguing. For desert it was a shared serving of pistachio praline gelatto and some cafes. Worth a visit and we will be back.",2
5,"Best breakfast in Tucson, hands down. I like the Cup Cafe and would rate it a close second, but for less expense, the food at Old Times is classic and prepared with care. In particular, their home fries and biscuits and gravy are among the best I've ever had, and they'll give you fresh homemade salsa for your eggs.I agree with others that the ambience and decor could use updating, but I think it's very clean and the service has always been friendly. Honestly, more than friendly, almost like a community - very very comfortable. I feel grateful for the Old Times Kafe, and its family-run mom and pop shop welcoming staff.",2
4,"Came by for a late breakfast of blueberry pancakes. They were great pancakes with the blueberries in the batter and blueberry syrup with blue berries in them also. The three pancakes were huge and delicious. It was all in Cracker Barrel style, it was cool so the fire place was burning. We will be back.",2
4,"We go to Sizzler in Sparks at least once a month - its always great. Around $40.00 for 2 people. But a gut buster - you wont leave hungry.You have got to go if for no other reason then to try the amazing cheesy toast they bring every table while you wait for your food! Go for the steak and all-you-can eat fried shrimp! Its great but my favorite is the amazing salad bar..... normally thats all I get because it has so much! If you can think of a topping for a salad they have it out, and everything is always fresh and wonderful. They have mountains of fresh fruit also! Plus they have the tostada bar - tacos, taco salads - and DONT FORGET to grab a few of those wonderful fried chicken wings they totally ROCK! Also the pizza is pretty good. I think they also have soup but I havent tried that yet - no room!!!Then there is a desert/ice cream bar to top it all off!The ONLY thing i have found that I dislike about this place is the drinking glasses are VERY small - which annoys me because I feel bad about constantly having to ask for a refill - I'm not sure if the little glasses are so the wait staff gets BIG tips - but it definatly works because once I make the poor server bring me 10 refills I feel almost obligated to leave a fat tip! I've been considering bring in my OWN big glass and save the poor person so many trips - but that would be kind of ghetto right? HahahaGo to Sizzler its GREAT!!!",2
4,"We wanted breakfast at 10:30 am on a Friday, so we used Yelp and went to this place.  It was exactly what we wanted.  We sat outside on the patio and enjoyed the weather while eating our food.  The Make your Own Hash was so good, I practically licked my plate clean.  I also tried the wheat toast with homemade strawberry jam.  It was tasty.  I wish I could take a jar home with me.  We might even return tomorrow for breakfast again.  The only reason I could not give them 5 stars was the service.  It wasn't bad, just nothing impressive.",2
4,"The experience I had renting with National at this airport wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be after reading the other reviews. There was no separate Emerald Club line that National claims all their Emerald Club Counter Service locations have, but there was only one customer ahead if me anyways so I didn't really have to wait that long. Since I am an Emerald Executive Elite Club member, all of the rental agreements were already printed out and waiting for me at the counter. All I had to do was sign the papers and take the car keys. I reserved a full size vehicle, which is the largest vehicle you are able to reserve at this location - unfortunately no premium or luxury vehicles.  I was given a pretty wide selection of cars and ended up taking the best which was the Chevy Malibu. I really wish they would have the Emerald and Executive Aisles here or offer better vehicles because it's been quite a while since I've had to drive a car with a four cylinder in it, however It did get pretty decent gas mileage. As I was a walking through the parking lot where all the rentals companies keep their cars, I noticed that Hertz had a few luxury cars parked in their aisles. So if your looking for something better than a full size, rent from them. Otherwise, National is adequate with your rental car needs. They have also solved the issue with signing the damage waiver before you drive off with your car.",2
1,"Good reviews are quite often written by employees to bring in the mass. Unfortunately, true statement and situations, such as mine, are never told due to that unsatisfied and upset customers just prefer to move on and forget their horrific visit. This location needs to greatly improve on food quality. I expressed my opinions to their Corp office and they said that they  would refund (me on a specific day when I received bad food) if I gave them a credit card # over phone or email. I paid cash! Why cc #?! Makes you say hummm! Then after several attempts to get my last visit refunded they finally offered a gift certificate which would be mailed to me. Did I get it you ask?...why, no, of coarse not. All in all, Pita J needs to go away. Liars put a bad taste in anyone's mouth. PJ - your food is sub-par at best. Too many options in area. Go elsewhere.",0
4,This a great little coffee shop that has great coffee and espresso. Great place to grab a coffee and get some work done if necessary. I will definitely be stopping by again to get some iced coffee or cappuccino when I'm in town.,2
4,"I've been here quite a few times now and the ambiance and food are great! It is a bit on the pricey side but their salads are worth it! They have a make your own salad list, where you can check any ingredients you want in your salad for a flat price of $15 and the portions are huge! The service here is also great! Definitely recommend this place!",2
5,Awesome atmosphere and even better pizza  owner served us and was a gentleman. Checked in on us regularly and made sure we were well taken care of. Would highly recommend to anyone in the area,2
5,"We drive 30min roundtrip when there are 8 Chinese restaurants within 2 miles of our home and several that will deliver.We stumbled on this one late at night. Have not eaten at the restaurant but use CARRYOUT and it is now without a doubt the only place we will go get carry out Chinese on the east side of Indy. We've had the Mongolian Beef, the Beef Kung Pow, the Beef Chow Mei Fun several times (3 meals in a box), their Chicken on a Stick is the BEST (get 2, you'll want them later), the Nicest Crab Rangoon flavor we've had any where in Indiana.",2
3,"First time there today. Went at 11:45am. Not very crowded. Got the tchoup street service. Overall, a good job, but little things were missed - didn't wipe the entire dashboard, rims weren't completely cleaned, some parts of windows were still dirty.  Had they been really busy, I would have chalked it up to that, but instead, I have to figure they belong to the ""good enough"" school of the service industry. Will probably go back because it's so close to my house, but won't expect more than a three star experience.",1
5,"I went here last night for a relative's birthday. Everything from the pesto/olive oil with bread to the mascarpone and limoncello icing cake was DELICIOUS. We tried a bunch of apps (eggplant rollentini, caprese salad, grilled calamari, bruchetta)--all great!Very fresh tasting, great specials, reasonable prices, super nice owner and staff. It's off the beaten path a little, but now that we've found it, we will definitely be back soon! Plus, they take reservations AND are BYOB!",2
1,"Staffed exclusively by apathetic, dull-witted employees committed to helping you as little as is humanly possible. First one I asked for help wasn't even aware the business had closed 15 minutes before, which would have saved me some time; the second replied to a question about whether there were any other open car washes close by with ""Do you know how to work GPS on your phone?"" Absolute waste of time.",0
3,"Let me start with the positive. The staff and customer service here is exceptional. They will go out of their way to make things right for you and accommodate your needs. However, the hotel facilities they have to work with is in dire need of renovation. The shower in our room dripped all night long; the toilet would not flush properly; consequently it repeatedly overflowed; the tile in the bathroom was broken in several places and dirt had accumulated in the large chipped areas; the facing on the bathroom sink had a huge crack and the toilet paper holder was falling out of the facing; attempts to fix the facing was evident by spackle smeared near the crack and gloves of glue around the toilet paper holder. The furniture in the living are was visibly soiled and the lamp shade in the bedroom was broke.  It's unfortunate that Hilton does not renovate this hotel. The staff was awesome and it would be a shame for them to lose business due to the outdated and falling apart facilities.",1
5,"I go here all the time for a quick bite to eat in the city. The food is fresh and there's a big variety. They offer good coffee, sandwiches, breakfast and even have a little grocery store with produce and frozen foods and much more. Super convenient and the staff is always very pleasant with a good sense of humor. They even offer a sandwich happy hour during the week. There is seating available as well",2
1,"AVOID THIS LIKE THE PLAUGE!!! I can see why they make money, this place is beautiful, but their customer service is atrocious. As someone in the event planning industry, I will see to it that I never recomend this location to any of my clients and will make sure all my partners and colleges know of the dissapointment that is Gaylord Opryland.I was hesitant to even book this location due to the horrible reviews, but this is where she really wanted to go. Lesson learned the hard way. Never in my life have I been more disgusted with customer service, this establishment doesnt even deserve one star. As a professional event planner, I am very organized and always check my reservations. I have been planning my best friends bachelorette party since April, and booked online in advance. I called several times prior to our trip to assure it was okay that a seperate credit card holder reserved the room, and we paid with a deperate one.I had guests arriving from all over, some drove 10+ hours and when they arrived, were not able to check in. They were refused to it being under a different name, even though I confirmed this was okay prior to arriving. They needed the confirmation number, but the one THEY SENT ME (email proof) was not working. I called the front desk while still en route to Nashville to let them know guests were waiting, and BOTH women were extremely rude and condescending. My guests had to wait an hour before getting a room.We arrived at 4pm and had a tight schedule as we had activites starting at 5:30. We were supposed to go in, decorate for the celebration, get ready and leave. This was not the case. Upon checking in, I am told that they preauthorize the card AT CHECKIN, even though I confirmed several times over the phone that the card was just to reserve the room and we could pay at check out with our choice of payment. We had girls from all over the country coming that were bringing money towards the room, and it was to be deposited before checkout. We did not have time to go to the bank before our paid for, scheduled activities and the only offer they gave us was to preauthorize half of the amount one night until we get the rest tomorrow. At this point we are already late and not ready for our outing due to their poor communication, and it ruined our other experiences as well.The fun doesnt stop there....we paid for a junior sweet with a sofa and a chair, two beds, and paid extra for a pull out bed. Upon FINALLY getting into our room, there is no extra bed, and not a sofa, but two chairs. This was crucial to our sleeping arrangments, and was all requeated and confirmed prior to arrival. We also requested it when they gave us a room key, and now its 12 oclock at night and we have one pull out sofa and they are still giving us a hard time about the sofa. If we could, wed pack and leave immediately but this is a once in a life time thing for my best friend, so were stuck here. Awful, awful, awful!What a great scheme, draw in customers with a beautiful resort and then dont give a shit about them once they're here. Class act.",0
5,"Delicious fresh chips and guacamole. I had the sopa with sausage, tostada with spicy chicken, and a burrito with carnitas. All were excellent. The only complaint is that the paper lining the plate ended up in my food.",2
3,"Excellent deep dish pizza! Worth the hassle?...barely. This review for carry out. It's Germantown, so parking is a process of circling a three block radius of where you want to go, till you find a spot. After struggling thru a crowd at the door waiting for tables I had to hunt down someone that worked there. The waitresses seem to be selected for youthful vigor not customer service skills :) About 20 min after arriving I finally got my pizza that I called in more an hour before and headed home.",1
5,What's not to like? Inexpensive delicious unique food. Chili Cheese Etouffee is my favorite but I have never had anything bad there. All good. Still my favorite location for Yats even though they all have the same yummy food. If you haven't tried Yats what are you waiting for? Go!,2
4,"The tour was great! Bob was funny and kept hubby & I entertained ..  We stop at 4 different places .. Oceana for seafood gumbo, Vic's for muffaleta, the gumbo pot  for jambalaya & tujagues bar for brisket PoBoy.  I got my tickets thru Groupon (which I recommend). The food was ok'ish.. Best place was Oceana.  Overall it's a great tour and I recommend to do it at the start of your trip, that way you can go back & try the restaurant you liked best. We will definitely be returning to Oceana.  Also, if you do return to 2 of the restaurants you get a discount for mentioning you were on the tour. Thank you Bob, we had an awesome time. One suggestion.. A dessert stop to end the tour would be great!",2
4,"Made a quick stop in New Orleans & we're so glad we stopped here for lunch! The food was amazing. We ordered the crab cake and blacked fish - both so fresh and delicious. On top of that, they had $4 bloody mary's!The service was great too - very knowledgeable about the food and the history of the building. They even shared some ghost stories with us, too bad we didn't run into the ghost of Antoine.After eating we explored the building & sat on the balcony upstairs. The balcony overlooks Jackson Square and it's such a beautiful view. Such a great spot to sit, drink, and hear live music from the street :)",2
1,"We love Philly and go every New Years Eve. We have experienced many hotels in the area ... this by far was our worst. The location is ok, not great. Their are some restaurants ( El Rey, continental) within walking distance. (walking distance to us is 5-10 blocks). The parking is $36 a day. The valet was polite and did there jobs. Front desk was nice and did there jobs as well. No issues with the staff. The lobby is misleading.The room size is average but the bathrooms are small and nonfunctional. The bed sucks no polite way to say it, first night I was up every hour due to the discomfort. REQUEST extra pillows! Was not super clean either in the bathroom. The rooms are not sound proff!!!! We could hear a couple fighting on top of us. To the point where we had to go to the lobby because we thought he was killing her. We could hear full conversations. Now this also explains the people who frequant the hotel.  This point is even more illistrate by the fact when we brought the fight to the attention of the staff they were not phased. I know it was New Years but listening to a girl getting choked out was not a good time actually it was a buzz kill. So we will never stay here again.",0
1,"As a senior, I was looking for a bank for investments.  I wanted to diversify, and not have all my money with Edward Jones which is a great investment company.  When I entered the bank I was ignored.  The employees were chatting.  I had $500,000+ to invest.  I do not know why I was treated this way, but I chose to leave and go else where.",0
5,"We ordered vegetables fried rice and beef noodle soup to-go. Both dishes were flavorful and delicious. What impressed me even more was the customer service. They asked if we would like the noodles and soup separate for the beef noodle soup, and also asked if we wanted eggs with the fried rice (which was helpful because I would otherwise assume without eggs). The fried rice came with a side of hot chili oil that was really good as well.",2
1,"Went to have lunch and place had nice ambiance and service was very good and friendly. Then came the food. They had several options. I had the pick three of sausage, brisket and ribs. The two sides were beans and greens. Out of the three meats the sausage was the least worse. All were dry and the sides did not have favors I would expect. I did not like anything. You even had to pay for bread.  I tried covering them up with the bbq sauces however even those were strange tasting. The sweet was pure molasses. The house was the only one I could tolerate.  I think they need to hire a cook that has tastebuds. We tried the apple crumble pie for desert and we even threw that away as it had no sweetness at all and no texture.  The price was crazy. Never again. Go to one of the many BBQ places in St. Louis that actually has good food.",0
5,I really enjoy the service here. I've been coming here for almost my entire life and the food never ceases to amaze me!,2
4,"the 4 stars are for the bar and decor - awesome beer selection ALWAYS, fantastic staff and uber cool decor. the food, though, definitely leaves something to be desired. i don't think i'm in the majority here, but eh - pass on the food. the only exception being the fried string beans. those are AWESOME. most def get those. perfect complement to a perfect beer. fantastic for happy hour or drinks. or for a first date.",2
5,Come hungry leave feeling like a true Merican Glutton!! Mmmmerca!!! Again be sure to pass on a few of the earlier items as the Gauchos bring out the better cuts later. I have nothing bad to say about my time here. I am still full!,2
5,"Hands down the best Indian food in STL. Tried Indian restaurants all over the city, none of them even comes close to the authenticity of the taste that i experienced here.Each and every item on the buffet was outstanding, which makes it even more extraordinary considering buffet items general are bland and tasteless.Keep up the outstanding establishment, hope to come here more often",2
5,When we lived a block away we constantly ate here after church. It was good back then and now it's even better. The chicken and waffle is superb topped with sausage gravy and scrambled eggs. Don't get no better. The wife had the eggs Benedict this morning and the eggs were cooked perfectly.  Great atmosphere hardly ever a line which is weird because it sits inside the Blake hotel on st Charles.   Great staff very friendly and quick. A little on the high side for breakfast but I like it better than the world famous mothers restaurant down the street.,2
5,"As Indian restaurants go, the lunch buffet was very good.  Excellent food. Great price.  Restaurant clean.  Staff very nice.  Hey, it met all my standards.  Even has flatscreens and nice decor. But yet need to check bathroom.",2
5,"Awesome dining experience once again.  I have eaten here twice and they just nail it!  Great service, food, ambiance, the works.  I had the filet each time with scallops and asparagus, and a nice red wine.  I will definitely be going back.",2
5,"Beautiful space, well trained staff and an elevated food experience. Everything is locally sourced and Home made, even their unique daily breads and butter! I could eat the corn custard dish every day if my life. But what I love most are their cocktails, specifically the gin w/ mint cucumber. They go down almost too easy! I have been following the owner & chef, George Sabatino, from Stateside and glad he's found a place to call home in Rittenhouse.",2
5,"This a lovely restaurant! It sits in a whimsical setting and its home feel makes it very welcoming. I love this over any big chain restaurant. Service was great. Their grapefruit margarita was just right and the appetizers were right on. My favorite was the chicken bacon flatbread. The dough was fresh and the right consistency. The artichoke spinach dip was yummy too, but it was the chips that added the right touch. The hubby loved the calamari. To top it all off we received a loyalty card! Love that!",2
5,"Delish! One of my favorite sb pizza joints. Yummy thin crust, great toppings, and great variety on the menu. Just wish it wasn't in the mall!",2
5,"Fantastic spot to sit down, cool down, and sip the best espresso in Indy. Lots of tables and super friendly and helpful staff. I would come back here again and again and again. I had the Italian macciado. It is very smooth and sweet. Expertly done. Thanks for the great time guys.",2
5,"This is seriously one of the best farmer's markets I've been to between (and including) San Francisco and San Diego. You can get almost anything here - from painted gourds to shrimps to organic lavender bunches to sweet cherries. Add in a backdrop of perfect weather and background music from a sitar player and a high school minstrel troupe and you'll start to get an idea of what's what here. All this and mas at totally reasonable prices too. I recommend trying out a cherimoya if you've never had one - it's a real treat!For more info on the weekly schedule, check out the website - the one on Saturday is on the corner of Santa Barbara and Cota Streets and it goes from 8:30 to 12:30. Even though it's pretty bustling, parking wasn't a problem.",2
3,"Took awhile for me to get service from the people working because they were busy talking in the back so that made me kinda annoyed, but other then that it was a good meal..Nothing really special.",1
5,"Had lunch here for my birthday on October 7th and was not disappointed.It was definitely one of the go to restaurants on this small pier and we really didn't have to wait that long to be seated. There was seating both outside and inside, but we decided to sit indoors since it was a bit windy and hot outside since we were literally in the ocean on the pier.My boyfriend got us the shrimp cocktail salad and the 4lb (maybe it was 6lbs lolz) crab to share that was the special of the day. But out waiter had informed us that they ran out of the specific crab we wanted, but gave us two different crabs that was equivalent to the weight of the crab that we missed out on.Once our food arrived, we dug right in. Everything tasted, so delicious and fresh. We finished off everything that we ordered and made sure not to leave any sort of crab meat morsel behind. The shrimp salad was surprisingly good. It was light and the shrimps were juicy. The crabs had their own different flavors and came with really crispy onion rings on the side and melted butter. I definitely will come back here again cause pricey as it was we definitely got our monies worth!",2
5,"Can't thank the team at MO's enough for the outstanding customer service they displayed when I called from out of state to prepay for my mom's Birthday dinner.  She and her husband said not only did the staff act as if they were waiting for them to arrive, made them feel very special, but it was also the best dining experience they have ever had.  Wonderful meal and terrific service by JR.  thank you Mo's!",2
4,"I'm a fan, even though we don't frequent chains, and I'm about to tell you why. This restaurant is great for families with small children. They have a great selection of kid's choices which is so important to us at this point in our life. They have a good selection of moderately priced meals and you can choose how healthy or unhealthy you want to be! I always get something different but this review is going to be about a new item - the steak and Gorgonzola alfredo pasta. Not healthy in case you're wondering. Amazingly good in case you're wondering. The steak was surprisingly good, I had it cooked to medium rare. The pasta is just pasta, and good, but the addition of the Gorgonzola cheese was such a treat! It brought to almost a fine dining level. I was shocked at how much I liked this meal for less than $20.  I've had a few of the newer items, but this is my favorite.",2
1,"I went to this nail salon for the first time and did not have a good experience. I went with two friends of mine and we made reservations. You would think when you make reservations you would not have to wait an hour. Also, we were not able to sit together. The people who work here are very unfriendly and extremely rude to you. The lady I had did not say one word to me the whole time and rushed through my pedicure and manicure. She did not do a nice job with painting my nails. She kept messing up and having to redo my nails. I would never come back here! Look elsewhere!",0
5,"This was by far the best experience I've ever had at a restaurant. The facility was near spotless, the food was amazing and the staff was friendly. I had some ""Fried Ravioli"" and some Buffalo Wings. The root beer is extremely sweet which makes it even better. The Fried Ravioli was cooked precisely, evenly coated with batter all around. The breaded ravioli was fresh and delivered as soon as it was fresh off of the deep frier. The Buffalo Wings were perfectly, and evenly seasoned with sauce. The celery that came with the Wings were crisp and cool. I wish I lived in Tampa so I could come here all of the time! (I recommend a location in Virginia!)",2
5,"Several friends and I continued our mini-pub crawl of mixology bars (begun at Franklin Mortgage and Investment Co.) here. Good move!We parked it at the bar and got the show from Sasha, the bartender, who kept up friendly banter with us even as she concocted a variety of beverages throughout the course of our stay. The cocktail menu was fairly extensive, broken down into Prohibition- and Repeal-era drinks, not to mention long lists of bourbons, ryes, and scotches. I ordered an Aviation (a drink I make myself, with my own brandied cherries, but here they do it the right way, all out with Creme de Violette to tint it blue like the sky; Sasha let me take a look at the bottle, perhaps to know that it wasn't some awful curacao!) For another friend she created a drink with Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction's Root liqueur (which is made with the roots and herbs used in old-fashioned root beer), chocolate bitters, seltzer and orange. We also partook of food here: First, duck fat fries (which have been a trend in Chicago, where I live, for at least a year, but I'd never had them; I'd never eaten anything involving duck before this, so now I suppose I have lost my duck fat innocence). These were thick-cut, rich in taste [gratis the duck fat, one presumes], not actually greasy, but definitely better when ordered with the cup of cheese sauce on the side. We also got soft pretzel sticks, which would have been fine but not especially remarkable without the mustard sauce (which had a distinct taste of raspberry, to my mind) pooled in the cup underneath them.Overall, this was a friendly place with fab drinks and great food. I wish it was in my city.",2
4,"We took a group to Fox & Hounds after reading they were serving hot cider by the fireplace!  We informed the waitress we were looking for the hot cider and wanted to sit by the fireplace.  She showed us the indoor area which is pretty small but very cozy (it would be great in the winter!), she took us out to the poolside terrace which had cabana areas with one fire pit where someone was sitting.  We were extremely disappointed.  The waitress offered to take us to the courtyard area and have someone start a fire over there for us.  I thought this was extremely accommodating!  So we opted for a table in the courtyard and someone came to build us our own fire!The waitress then told us that the kitchen didn't know anything about the cider but they had called the head chef and we're going to make it for us.  I thought it was very strange they would advertise something and then not even know about it, but I think they made up for it by making sure we still got it.I actually ordered wine and a few of the guys ordered beer.  The other members of our party ordered the cider and it came with a splash of rum in a cute little tea cup with a saucer!Among the group we ordered; bangers and mash (came out cold and we sent it back), the liverpool wings (which the guys said were good and they looved the new castle sauce), the burger, the pulled chicken sandwich, fish and chips and a few orders of fries.  So we basically sampled most of the menu and the only items we as group really liked were the wings and fries.  I'm not sure if the restaurant is new and needs some practice or what the deal is but the food needs some work.    I love the place for it's charm and character.  The service and the drinks were good!  Definitely don't come hungry like we did.  I would recommend coming for drinks only or nightcaps after your belly is full!  It's a great ambiance if you want to sit and enjoy a fire!",2

3,"If I had only gotten the pastrami sandwich, I'd probably give them 2 stars.If I had only gotten the chicken bacon ranch sandwich, I'd have given them 4 stars. But I've had both, so 3 stars seemed right.The pastrami is not to be ordered here, it's just not good quality pastrami, period. Rubbery and fatty are words that come to mind.However, the chicken bacon ranch sandwich was excellent. The sauce and the cheese made it, and, of course, it had the bacon in it.If you've never eaten here before, prepare to possibly be yelled at when entering the store. They're shouters here, like at Moe's, and usually belt out a big welcome (entire staff) every time the door opens. It's startling enough when you walk in, but then picture eating in the store while the staff is screaming every 3 minutes.",1
5,I've been geeked up all week about gettin back to New Orleans so I could come to MR. B's bistro!!! When I say the shrimp and grits are the best Ever.... I do mean ever! I killed it!  I truly wanted to lick the bowl! Just greedy! My husband got the filet and loved it as well! Don't come to NOLA and not visit this place!!! The service was great too! We sat at the bar and Larry and Joshua were our bartender/servers!,2

1,"Over the summer I ordered from here without incident. Then comes fall and a particularly cold evening.We placed our order or tried at first. My friend repeated the order three times.  The repeated her card number 2 times.  Then became tired of repeating my address.  I gave them my address the 4th time.  We were told we'd get our Indian goodness in 30 - 45 minutes.  Not a problem.  We were fine with waiting.  We thought the repeating-ourselves-thing was pretty comical until...Over an hour later we had no Indian goodness.  We called the restaurant.  We let them know the time frame they gave us and that it was well past that time frame.  The person on the phone didn't seem to understand ""we've been waiting over an hour.  Can you tell us if the driver is near?""  Several times.  This time the repetition wasn't comical.  Then came Irate Guy On Phone.  ""DO YOU WANT YOUR FOOD!? DO YOU WANT YOUR FOOD!? WHY DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU WHERE THE DRIVER IS!? WHY!?""  My friend and I looked at each other as if to ask what just happened while Irate Guy On Phone kept screaming ""DO YOU WANT YOUR FOOD!?,"" Etc.  Driver finally showed up while this phone call was taking place.  My friend collected the food and paid the tab.  The food, mediocre.  Before to night I was fine with waiting to get it on the latter end of the stated time.  Tonight, a little late because of a lovely nor'easter but the person who answered the phone left such a rotten taste in my mouth that next time I will get into my wheels and haul my butt to pick up from a much better restaurant with less abusive service.Bad service made the mediocre food... meh.Portions or naan and poori: fail.  Yeeeeeaaahhh. No.Will I order take out or delivery again from this establishment? Nope.In short, Tandoor India, you bite and not the way I like.",0
4,Not our type of art but the space is a beautifully restored barn by the river and the Wyeth family collection is impressive.  The top floor collection was very good.Nice surprise to find some varied modern pieces on 2nd floor of different artists who created in local area - including Horace Pippin.  Come prepared and review The last Mohicans or Treasure Island first to better appreciate some of the pieces on ground floor.There was a brunch special going on that seemed to attract a lot of locals.  Scenic since right by the river.Take advantage of early Sunday free admission .,2
5,This is the best food I've had the whole time we've been at Nashville. In all seriousness the avocado toast with the home fries was the best I've ever had. The staff is amazing and we didn't have to wait  for a table. I wish we could eat this every day of our lives. Also my soy latte was AMAZING.,2
2,The food was good but service was ridiculous. A friend and I had bought a coupon book in support of the local high schools baseball team- one coupon being burger up. The coupon gave us a free milkshake with a purchase of a burger. Each of us being on separate checks and had our own separate coupons. The red headed server approached us with attitude and poor service not even asking us what milkshake we wanted when she had done it to the table next to ours. This was extremely frustrating and I will not be returning to Burger Up,0
4,Had a great lunch here. I ordered a chicken Caesar and my dining companion ordered a custom salad. Waitress had a great personality and did not rush us at all. Allowed us to linger. Great space which is hidden from the outside.,2
5,These place is so fun!  The food is excellent!  The drinks are good too!  Never had bad service here,2
4,"First time here, had the March special and H had Zen salad with chicken. Quick friendly service, good beer selection and food was up quick. The calzone was just the right size, and there was just the right amount of sauce to go with it. The salad was tasty and the large plentiful enough to share. Ambiance was good, music a touch too loud but great location. Will definitely come here again.",2
5,"The best chocolate croissant (petit pain au chocolat) I had in USA!  I like the atmosphere, very industrial look. The place is shared with a wine bar, so you can have an excellent sandwich made with a French baguette and a glass of wine. It was too early for me. I would recommend this place.",2
4,"Nice cozy place hidden from plain sight!Relaxing ambiance, pleasant crowd, friendly staff.French toast is a must have!",2
3,The environment of the restaurant is very nice. Service was very good and they were able to take care of us really well and fast although we were a huge group. The food was well prepared but we did not find it unique or special.,1
4,I'm a huge panara fan.  I just don't like coming in here around 5pm.  Traffic on Street Rd is terrible.,2
4,"Let's start off by saying that I love, LOVE, Mac and cheese. Saying that, I have to say that the Mac and cheese here is so externally good, I got ""The buff"" and it was so creamy and cheesy that I was literally just hit with all the flavors on this. The price/quantity is very good. I think the most expensive one is about $12 and the amount is more than enough to share with someone else ( But  what crazy person would ever share Mac and cheese? ) The store is very cute and although small with the outdoor seating is just so cute. The staff is super friendly and they're Sheryl temple is the best. And just the fact that they are environmentally conscious just gives them the extra point they didn't need at this point, you are actually able to take the container that they give you to re-use",2
4,"The ice cream here is delicious, portion size is very generous, and the staff is nice and patient! We had the morning coffee and rum raisin flavors. The dessert side of the place is super cute, but could be a bit cleaner. For a slow afternoon, the tables were pretty dirty and there were a few flies. The pricing for the neighborhood makes it still worthy though!",2
1,"Horrible place to live. Horrible customer service. They powerwashed the roof and slug came thru our A/C and stained the carpet and they have yet to come clean it up after a month. Zero lights at night so have fun walking up the stairs with your groceries. There are so many choices in this area for apts, KEEP LOOKING ELSE WHERE!!!! Even if there is a good price, they will increase the rent after one year by 20-40 percent, so if you like moving and packing up all your furniture n clothes, then move right in. If you're looking for a place to live where rent wont increase and force you to move out, then PASS ON CAMDEN BAY!!! Id recommend checking out Westchase area apts. Its a much nicer area, with all the amenities you need.",0
1,"DO NOT do business with this company!  I ordered what their website is describing as hand-tied hair extensions (they even have pictures of  hand-tied hair in the description) and I was sent machine wefted extensions.  I have tried repeatedly to contact the manager, but every time I call, I am told that he is ""working in another warehouse"" or on today's call, he was ""too busy.""  This has been going on since I first tried to reach them on 03/08/2016, the day that I received my hair.  The current going price for machine wefted hair is $179 for the length that I purchased.  I was charged $275 per bag and had ordered two bags.  Today, the customer service rep paged the supervisor and he told her to tell me that I needed to contact Bohyme directly, as that Bohyme is who shipped the incorrect product.  Lo and behold, I go to Bohyme's website and it states that all issues with products should be directed toward the company that sold the hair extensions.  So, not only does this company false advertise, the manager will not provide any type of return call or return email.  Don't waste your money on www.houseofbeautyworld.com.  I wish I would have seen the other reviews of their company before I spent so much money!",0
5,"If you're a lover of good food and lots of choices, this restaurant is for you. Number 1 dish of the night, the burger. My oh my, it was one of my top 3 of all time. Also tried the short rib Mac & cheese, crawfish dip, fried green tomatoes, beef stroganoff, rotisserie short rib, Brussels sprouts, and shrimp & andouille croquettes. Dessert special of the night was a chocolate chip skillet cookie with ice cream. (Side note, my friends and I didn't eat all day after reading over this menu in anticipation of our reservation). My favorite dishes were the burger, Brussels sprouts, crawfish dip and fried green tomatoes. Service was great and the drinks were strong. Do yourself a favor and visit this place.",2
5,"Whenever I do govt related copywork I bring it here.It's always been good & they will take care of you, even if you accidentally print a letter size copy onto a 11x17, for example.",2
5,"I was pleased to find at least one men's store on Magazine St.  It made the day of shopping a little more fun for my husband!  Denton was in the market for some cute casual T's.  He found one here for a very reasonable price.  They have some places to sit down while your husband shops.  If we were locals, we would definitely come back here!",2
5,"I love this place! Best Pho I have had in Reno! I always add fresh veggies to mine and it is perfect! I have also had their non pho items and they are also amazing! I was skeptical about coming here at first due the generic name and being attached to a gas station, but you will not regret it!",2
4,"Okay, so it's a dance club. It's trendy and offers higher-end cocktails and beers while still offering your run-of-the-mill wells and domestic bottles. On certain nights, guys have to pay a door charge (but that's not really uncommon in the industry). There is a huge patio and, even in the winter, almost the entire patio is still available because they enclose it. The music is pretty hit-or-miss...sometimes you're dancing away to classic hip-hop, pop, and even rock, and other times you're standing there while the DJ spins out an un-danceable tune. If you're on the patio, you can chat...but if you're inside it's (not shockingly) too loud to really talk. If you're in the CWE and you're looking to dance, at least give the Mandarin a shot; it's not going to be for everyone, but it's pretty great if you're in the mood for it.",2
3,"Little disappointed considering all the stellar reviews.The veggie bibimbap was delicious but the yukgaejang was just ok, and a tiny portion despite being labeled as 16 oz. Also, it didn't come with rice which I thought was weird, and they charged me $2 for a small bowl of white rice, so the $4.95 yukgaejang became a $6.95 yukjgaejang. The pa-jeon was just ok too. I guess Philly has a pretty weak Korean food scene in general, but I wanted this place to be a little better. If it was next door I'd probably hit it up every now and then, but the problem is that we're not that close to here, and its just not good enough to warrant going very far for it. Inside only seats six.",1
3,"Sat. Jun. 10,17        Room 115: Made a stop in SB late evening arrived at 8pm to leave at 7am. Next morning.The Place is pretty clean. Being that I had stayed here before about 5yrs ago.So I called to see if there were any rooms available, which there was, they quoted me a price but when I go there it was $30 above what they had quoted me. I needed to rest so I ended up paying the $160I gave them 3 stars because the bed was hard and Walls are thin, can hear ppl next door talking and ppl upstairs walking. I was tired and wanted to rest after a long drive but it made it a bit difficult withe the noise.",1
4,"More of a legitimate toy store (like, for children) than a toy store aimed at adults (no, not THAT kind, I mean the goofy sort with stuff that you can find in the Archie McPhee catalogue). But hey, regular toys are fun too! Puzzles, games, stuffed animals, you name it.Obviously a good spot for buying gifts for the wee people in your life. Prices are a bit higher because of the ""boutique"" nature of the place. Poke around and get in touch with the youngster in you!",2
2,"The French bread is crusty an warm but... Ice cold butter? Seriously!Their shrimp & grits meal is a sauté of applewood smoked bacon wrapped jumbo Gulf shrimp served with creamy stone ground yellow grits and red-eye gravy.  Overall, the dish was flavorful and creamy. The shrimp were plump but the amount of grits was severely lacking; as if a shortage had occurred. That's NOT a good thing when the meal costs $27. Not worth it.For almost the same price, but a far superior shrimp & grits meal, visit Café Adelaide: Shrimp on Shrimp & Grits: dried shrimp crusted shrimp, grilled oregano red grits and absinthe-basil beurre vert for $26.00.",0
2,"Olivier's is a bit away from some of the more popular streets in the Quarter.I wanted to start off by saying that our service was great.  Our server was very ingratiating and took time to get to know us.Secondly, the dessert was great!  We have had bread pudding after every meal while we have been here and this was, by far, the best.  We also got the bourbon infused pecan pie, which was delicious, especially if you like the taste of bourbon.The entrees, however, were just average in my opinion.  I did not think the rabbit was very good at all, even though it is supposed to be the house specialty.  The oyster dressing that came with it was very sagey.  We also got the trio sampler, which had way too much dried parsley as a garnish.  The Shrimp & Chicken Andouille Jambalaya was good, but there was only a small scoop of that.  The sausage, in particular, was delicious.  The blackened fish filet turned out to be catfish, which I do not really care for.  The Crawfish Étouffée had good flavor, but they put it over top of the catfish, which took away from the flavor of the fish and did not let the Etouffee shine - I would have liked to see it separated.  We got some cornbread with our meal, which was decadent - I know that seems like an odd word to describe cornbread, but it was.  A generous mixture of melted butter and honey was poured over the top of the bread and made it amazing.  We did not have one, but they have a homemade hurricane that is steeping in a glass cooler with all kinds of fruit - it looks like it would have tasted amazing.  They also had two other cocktails steeping in other flavors that you might want to check out.  My suggestion is to go to a different restaurant for dinner and then stop by here for dessert on your way back to your hotel.",0
5,"These 5 stars are strictly for the Chicken and Waffles!  It's the only thing I've eaten there...cause when I go there I can't think of anything else to get., I taste the Chicken and Waffles while looking for parking!Here's a suggestion...you can take that gravy and seal some loose wallpaper with it...butter and syrup will do just fine....One thing....do you serve a half a waffle so we will ask for the second half and have to pay for it?  Come on!!!!Now....back to the Chicken part of the Chicken and Waffles....I am ashamed to write that my family made a pig of themselves by ordering more chicken and more waffles....But looking back...it I wasn't so embarressed, I would have done the same!",2
5,"This place has consistently good quality and excellent service. It's always a joy to pop by when I'm in Carpinteria! I recommend the Thai tea, the pad Thai (though it is more savory), the pad see iew, and the pineapple fried rice. The setting is peaceful, warm, and welcoming.",2
1,"IF YOU ARE FEMALE & YOUNG, GO SOMEWHERE ELSEI dropped off my car and told them I needed my oil change. They were very friendly and said they would have it done quickly, which was appreciated. When I came back to pick up my car three hours later, they charged me $75 dollars for the oil change. The guy working the counter could tell I was shocked (an oil change at the dealer usually costs $35).  He explained they had used synthetic oil. When I asked why they would give me synthetic oil when I didn't ask for it, he gave me some BS answer that it was standard for Toyotas. Since he could tell I was upset, he said they were running a special and knocked down the price by 25%. I am aware that I am a young woman and that I don't know much about cars but I do not appreciate being taken advantage of. I will be going elsewhere for car maintenance from now on.Wish I had read the reviews before trying out this Firestone. It looks like other women have had the same experience in the past.",0
3,"I've been here several times for dinner and for breakfast (which is only served Saturday and Sunday.)  The food is always good, the atmosphere can't be beat, but the service is consistently sub-par. I went for breakfast just recently and the food was good, I ordered the french toast, and my wife ordered an omlette.  Both tasty and fairly reasonably priced, at least comparable to what you'd pay anywhere else for a decent breakfast.On to the service:  Somewhere after topping my coffee off a couple times we seemed to be forgotten.  After finishing our meals we proceeded to sit and wait for a couple to-go boxes and our checks for a good 20 minutes.  During which time a couple waiters/bus boys walked past us.  My wife told me to motion for the check, but I don't want to have to do that.  Normally I'm a decent tipper, 25% no problem, but I consistently get poor service here and it's always from the SAME WAITER.  This time I was fed-up it and I left exact change.  I'm tired of feeling obligated to tip even if the service is sub-standard.In summary:  Good food, awesome atmosphere,  poor service.",1
5,Loved it! The staff is incredibly genuine and sweet. I fell outside the restaurant and was greeted with an entire first aid kit and staff constantly checking up on me. Food was amazing- I'd suggest the tenderloin.,2
2,"Seven of us came to celebrate a family event-our waiter Rene was the best-sharp, witty and made us feel like family.  Unfortunately, the food did not-two people ordered the seafood bouillabaisse and both said it was tasteless.  Fish that was served was just ok-we thought we had walked into the movie set of Ratatouille before the young chef had been allowed to cook.  The dessert was frozen solid so it had to be returned.  The food was disappointing but Rene was a showman who did his best.",0
5,"Only open during Fiesta, the first weekend (friday at noon, sat and sun 10am) in August!!! If you are in Santa Barbara at all on this week of celebration and you love authentic Mexican food you must come here!  You will love all the great food they offer here and the dancing and music.  There is beer and wine.  I usually come here for a big bowl of pazole for breakfast, but before I do that you must order some tomales.  Get here early for the tamales because the line gets long.  This place is the real deal.  And not to be missed if your a serious foodie. Viva la Fiesta!!!",2
3,"***APPROACH WITH CAUTIONS.***The bad reviews that I have read are about this gym's contract, specifically their cancellation policy which I can see why.MEMBERSHIP.  On the application, you'll be asked for your SS#, DL#, your employer, job title along with the standards; name, address, phone #.  My doctor office asks for this ask well. Do you give out SS# and DL# readily?CANCELLATION POLICY.  Pay $65 to go 1 month, or pay $42/month (taxes & fees, etc.) with 2-month cancellation notice.  Make sure you cancel in person and stay on them.  You shouldn't have to but that's how some businesses make money nowaday. It's the new screw-ppl-legally business model, I think. If you're hurt and can't come back, doesn't matter.  If they tell you it does matter, please get it on paper.This is the same as Anytime Fitness on 4th ST N.  Both are franchises.GYM.  Cavernous but with lots of equipments, it's a tight fit.  Very clean.  It's opened 24 hours on weekdays.  The front desk people reminds me of going to a chain auto shops or a used car sales lot.

1,"Yelp doesn't allow to leave 0 star review, so that is why you see one star. Me and my wife are moving from NY to South California, and we contacted 5 different moving companies. I sent my initial email to United Van Lines on 05/02/2018, and soon I got email back with Virtual Survey confirmation for 05/10. The lady that did virtual survey was very meticulous and professional and we ""screened"" through the whole apartment in 15 minutes. No one contacted me after that, so I sent a second email almost a month after, on 06/05 asking if everything is ok, and if I can get the quote. I don't need to mention that other 4 companies sent their quotes in less than 48 hours. Since no one replied til today, I called the direct phone and I left the message on the answering machine. No one called me back. I hope everything is ok, and that no one is hurt, because I don't see any other reasonable explanation why they are avoiding me. Very, very unprofessional.",0
3,"The service was excellent, extremely friendly.  The food was average, the hummus didn't taste fresh as of that day.  The gyro plate was also average.  For this immediate area, this is about as good as it gets.    Prices are reasonable.",1
4,Great property.  Minimalist decorating.  Bar and 2 restaurants onsite.  The rooms get a 5 for sleep stars.  Zero noise between neighboring rooms.  It is a huge draw for a few local companies and whatever local convention is taking place (center adjacent to the hotel).  The pillows receive 4 stars which edged every courtyard I've stayed at recently by a landslide.  Who needs sleep?  Someone who heavily metrics en suite noise pollution and pillow quality.,2
3,"I stopped here after a long drive from DC.  The place was fairly busy on a Sunday night.  There is a great selection of draft beers.  I went for the combo deal (wings, boneless wings, fries and coleslaw for $15).  The medium was spot on and the honey BBQ was good).  There is a huge selection of flavors.  The wings themselves were okay and there is a large selection of TVs to watch.  There is also electronic Texas hold em that you can play.  Not a place I would go out of my way to visit but definitely worthy of an occasional dinner.",1
3,"Nice place.  Waitress was attentive and did a great job.  We enjoyed salad and the cheese bread sticks.  I would get both again.  We had a handtossed sausage pizza.  The pizza itself was not the best becuase the sausage was terrible.  I would not recommend the sausage at all.  If you enjoy eating sausage, don't come here to eat it.",1
5,Great food!!!!! Decent price! Only draw back was soda in a can but not an inconvenience :) or a reason to take away a star.,2
5,"What a great experience! The courses are delicious and it's hard to make a wrong choice here. Also, a surprisingly great cocktail menu (in the top three restaurant menus I've had) and attentive staff. Every minute and every plate was amazing.",2
5,"Great local brunch spot that seems to be more popular among the neighborhood folk than the tourist crowds.  I would certainly frequent this restaurant if I lived in the area.  The setting is very low-key, the service a little on the slow side, but the food was outstanding -- certainly the shrimp and grits, and the banana's foster french toast.  I really enjoyed the combination juice -- thick, fresh and flavorful and definitely not from concentrate.This was a gem from the lonely planet guide that lived up to expectations.Cash only.",2
5,"One of the best steaks I've ever had. Granted, you can find an equivalent steak for the half the price but what you're paying for here is atmosphere and elegance. I'd suggest Duling-Kurtz as a meal for a special occasion. The bread-turnovers they serve before you receive your meal are mouth watering. The turnovers are served with your choice of butter or house made lemon curd. A truly unique taste.The steak (as mentioned above) was superb. Served with a peppercorn crust and drizzle, the taste is something I'll never forget. Served with garlic, parmesan french fries (with garlic aioli) and grilled asparagus (the only entree that is served with fries ... excuse me, ""frites"". At restaurants like Duling-Kurtz we call them ""Frites"", god dammit :-) Everything was phenomenal. Don't come here expecting to penny-pinch. You're going to overpay for anything and everything but you'll be satisfied with taste and experience.",2
4,"I used to go here all the time for the lunch special, and it was a great deal. We've been only a few times in the last year because my husband isn't a fan, but I enjoy it. The prices do seem to have gone up a fair bit in recent times, but it's still never a disappointing meal.",2
5,"My partner and I had a really great experience with Keswick Cycle. Super knowledgeable staff, really kind and helpful and very fair prices. We dragged 2 bikes out of my garage that had been in there for at least 5 years, and were able to get everything we needed to have them in great working order--two tunesups (one each) helmets, bike lights, and great locks, which they even helped us fit to our bikes and installed the holsters for the lights and locks free of charge. They fixed my broken chain, adjusted my kickstand, and aligned everything, fixed the tires, etc. They appraised the bikes so we'd know how much we can sell them for when we're done with them or when we move as long as they stay in good condition.I highly recommend Keswick Cycle.",2
5,"My computer got hacked and instead of taking it to Apple where they do a blanket sweep for $250 and it takes multiple days, Chris was able to walk me through what had happened.He removed all of my files on an external drive and swiped the comp, put them back on and even re-installed Word for me free of charge.He then changed all of the settings to make my computer as secure as possible and downloaded his preferred ad-blocker which also blocks ads on YouTube videos, which will be forever awesome. It was cheaper, faster, and more hands on and thorough than Apple. Highly recommend his abilities.",2
5,"I can't say enough of this place!  I had lunch, again, at my favorite Chinese restaurant today.  I was in a rush so had to order something simple yet covered my favorite meats: duck, roast pork, chicken.  I was not disappointed.  Great flavor and bulls eye on the crispy skin.  I can eat here every day and twice on Sunday.  Shame they are closed on Tuesday.  The service was good.  Portions were decent for the price.  I just ordered one plate.  My usual days would have been 4-5 entrees.  Not that I am a big eater or big in stature, but I like ordering plenty.  One has to be a plate of roast pork.  I do not think i have had one bad dish in the all the times I have dined here.  The bakery is super fabulous.  I always leave with a bag of their desserts.  I just wish there were more parking on Grand.  Going again this weekend!",2

5,OMG! What an amazing dinner experience. A friend recommended this place and it was incredible. We had two of their signature dishes -- the BBQ shrimp and bread pudding. This is a fantastic restaurant with great ambience and fantastic service. Highly recommend it if you're visiting New Orleans. Their fried green tomato appetizer was a great way to kick off the meal.,2
5,"I spent New Years Eve here, and it was truly the most memorable one I may have ever had. I live in NYC, but travel to New Orleans often for New Years and this year it was a total of 10 of us traveling. We had a table at Marche together and it was the most elegant, fun evening. We had perfect views the fireworks at midnight from the deck and all the windows. The food was exceptional (buffet and passed hors d'oeuvres) and the waitstaff all went above and beyond. Brandi, one of the waitresses is truly happy seeing others have a great time and felt our smiles were her reward - other major cities seeking solid waitstaff should clone her. This was Marche's first NYE party and I suspect this will be the hottest ticket in New Orleans in the upcoming years.",2
4,"Hankering big time for some all-can-eat sushi, we struck out for Saki Endless Sushi. Saki, a converted UPS Store was tucked away on Gulf to Bay Boulevard. What a delightful surprise. The rolls were beautifully prepared and the fish super fresh. Try the ""Top of the World"" Roll or the ""2 in 1 Crispy"" Roll. Melt in your mouth deliciousness! The Salt and Pepper shrimp was quick fried, hot and oh so good!",2
2,"We walked through the whole space without a single ""can I help you"", the products are most certainly not ""more-than-old"", this is a glorified gift shop.

1,"Terrible! Rude service, and very dirty. Floors had trash on them. The bathroom that I used had water (or some other substance) on the floor. I was pregnant and taking the glucose tolerance test which takes a long time. I had to use the bathroom often. I was scolded for using the bathroom because the water was turned off which they apparently do during a urine drug test. I had no idea...and then I couldn't flush the toilet or wash my hands. I wasn't even offered to use another sink. Ridiculous!",0
5,"Great atmosphere, great music, excellent food. One thing I will state is that this is not the place to come for fast service. Everyone works in relax no rush mode. But this is a great place if you looking have great food and simply look t relax and enjoy your surroundings!",2
4,"When with some local friends for dinner and drinks and it was a cool place, definitely very trendy with the old warehouse feel and wood and industrial vibe. They brew there own beers as the name suggests, I had the copperhead pale ale which was very good. I had the Reuben and it was great, lots of meat piled high, also had the beer battered fried and they were awesome...highly recommend the fries. Others had bacon cheeseburgers and they enjoyed them. Good place to meet friends for food and drinks.",2

4,"I've lived in the Philadelphia area for about 15 years and I'm sad to say that I only learned of Ralphs about a year ago. To me, Ralphs is the embodiment of Philadelphia. The food is about as traditional Italian as you can get. It's the oldest Italian Restuarant in America that is still operating. The food is great and the service is exactly what you would expect from an old school Italian joint. If you are hosting guests from out of town and you want to show them what Philadelphia is all about...take them to Ralphs. They will leave very full and completely satisfied. Truly one of Philadelphia's most prized venues.",2

All it needed fixed was the tab to zip up the jacket.  It works like it is brand new and cost me very little.  Very happy!!!Ben was the gentleman who helped me and he was very nice. I met 2 wonderful folks from this location....Nikki and Nina.  They were great...so nice and helpful!  I was going to have some alterations done on some other clothing.  However after discussing what it could cost, Nikki was honest enough to say it may not be worth it as I could buy something for almost the same cost.  I so appreciated her honesty!!!I will bring all my clothes to this location...but highly recommend any of the West Oak Cleaner locations.",2
5,"After trying twice unsuccessfully to get there early enough to get a meal within 20 minutes, I finally was able to break away from work and was 5th in line. I had heard of the ""food truck nazi"" and that it was the best in town and found Gus, the falafel nazi, as he called himself, lived up to his reputation and more. As my turn came up, I approached the cart tenuously, for I did not want to blow it by asking too many questions. He immediately recognized me as a new customer and told me all about the fresh ingredients he uses.Chicken is cooked over coal and was tender on the inside and perfectly cooked on the outside. Falafel was delicious, as were the grapes and his homemade pasta that went along with it.There was enough food for 2 people.Well worth the wait!",2
4,We like the food here. I had the borsetti: it was creamy and simply delicious. The waitress was very friendly. It probably helped that the restaurant was almost empty... One of my favourite places to eat!,2

4,"Had a decent experience checking in and out.Was in town for the last week of July.  Came in on a Sunday evening and left on a Saturday afternoon.  My shuttle rides to and from the airport came in minutes.  Service was overall friendly, and not hectic.  I prepaid for the rental and the remaining balance ended up being less than what I was originally quoted.Got a nice and clean Ford Festiva '14.  When I came to the gate for final check out, the man told me that the car's code didn't match up with what was on my paperwork.  But he fixed that on his end in minutes.I highly recommend gassing up right before you check back in.  I did it the day before, but I was three gallons short and the lady was going to charge me $9 or so per gallon.  I asked where I could go to fill up and she directed to me the nearest BP that's few blocks down the street.Thank you Hertz for a nearly painless experience.",2
2,"Food is not worth the price, fills a hole at best. Went there for brunch because of the reviews. Menu had some leftover food on it from last customers. Service was ok, coffee was way too strong and had floating grounds in it. Probably one of our least favourite meals while staying in New Orleans.",0
5,"I love YATS!!!  This was one of my favorite things about living right by Broad Ripple when I was in college.  The food is excellent and freaking cheap.  You may not love everything you can get here, but you will find SOMETHING you love.  I still go here anytime I am in the Indianapolis area.  UPDATE:  They recently stopped allowing credit cards again.  It's a cash-only joint.",2

The meal was delivered to the table in a timely manner and staff was very friendly. Food was delicious!",2
1,"This store has the worst customer service time and time again. This morning I went in at 11am (when they open) and there were probably four other customers browsing the store. I turned the corner and the associate looking shocked said ""we don't open until 11."" I said it is 11 and her other associate said yeah it is 11. She then said well let me check. Comes back and said no one will be at register because they're closed. (The door to the front was open)I asked if I could buy something and she looked at me like I was dumb and said ""ya."" I was both confused and annoyed so I left. Three times before this the service was also terrible.",0

K- the exterior of the store was very clean, and the entrance was good and really looked presentable. I- the introduction to the place was great as well! It was a sit yourself place so no hostess, but it took about a minute for the waitress to get to us and she was super nice and friendly. She was a great representative to the place.S- the service was very good, it wasn't too long, or too short. The waitress filled out waters when it was empty and she asked if we needed anything. The only negative was she didn't ask if we wanted our pickles filled up.S- the overall satisfaction was great. The food was great. I had the bacon and cheddar burger and it was cooked to perfection and the cole slaw was fantastic! The only negatives was the pickles not being filled up and the price was a little high, I don't think the price was reasonable.Great place! Gotta love the endless pickles!",2
3,"I've had the pleasure of experiencing Han Dynasty's exquisite Sichuan cuisine in the Old City and University City locations. Today a friend and I decided to try something new. We tried Han Dynasty Cherry Hill. Good: pea leaves with garlic. These were excellent! Get these! In addition, get the spicy crispy cucumbersCold Noodles in Chili Oil: I learned that the taste of the cold noodles depends on the master chef. IMHO, the master chef at the U City location makes a better cold noodle in chili oil dishGarlic Sauce Style: my friend had this. She said it tasted better at the Old City location.Ants Climbing a Tree: tastelessPlease read: we expressed our dissatisfaction to the General Manager and he was incredibly responsive. I give the manager 5 stars.",1

2,Long check outs  2 cashiers each with 4 customers got in line at 5:04 didn't get out Tim 5:26  managers took people from one line to another register but not ours.  1 customer had to do 3 separate order for her checks to work crazy,0
1,"After joining Yelp and reading the reviews for Lilly Nails, as well as reviewing their Facebook page,  I eagerly went for a pedicure and a mani polish change. Unfortunately, I was beyond disappointed as I was looking forward to quality work and an above average experience based on what I interpteted was a place that takes pride in their work.  The technician seemed annoyed when I asked to have the water a bit hotter.  I got the deluxe pedicure which I asked about prior to getting to ensure that more time would be spent on callus removal, however she spent about 30 seconds pumicing one foot and less than 20 seconds on the other foot missing a whole area on the bottom of my second foot.  She rushed the service and my pedicure and polish change together were at most 40 minutes.  When I go for a pedicure, particularly if I pay extra for what is considered a ""deluxe"" service, I expect the work and the experience as a whole to be above average.  Unfortunately, Lilly Nails did not even come close to meeting my expectations.",0
5,"Alright, so this place is getting a bit of a bad rap and I'm not sure why. I lived in LA for four years and so far this is the closest I can get to legit street tacos.If you want a great lunch, get the stuffed avocafo for an app and street tacos for lunch. Cannot go wrong. The service was absolutely fantastic and it's so cheap that I'm not sure what you can really complain about. So glad this place exists downtown !",2
5,"I highly recommend this place and had a couple different very good specialists. I wanted to give a special shout out to Cecilia as she makes the experience as fast and pain free as possible. I always make sure I get her when it's been a while between visits. Her technique is excellent. She also gives me tips on what to do in between visits which I appreciate. Thank you, Cecilia!",2
4,We had a great lunch today. The food was excellent as well as the service. We really loved that they are dog friendly on the patio. Great atmosphere. We will be back.,2
5,"Courtney Bradberry was friendly, professional, and gave a mean haircut. The salon itself is beautiful and actually reasonably priced for what it is. Will be returning soon.!",2
5,"Food was awesome! Ordered the shrimp cocktail, sauce is HOT so beware! But the shrimp was fresh and perfect! Ordered the filet sliders and fresh homemade chips. Perfect dinner at the bar! I will be back here again for a full filet and with my wife! This place will make an awesome date night. Love it!!!",2
5,"What an awesome hip, bluesy joint that knows how to do a sandwich justice. I mean the love and attention they provide to proving quality products is hands down top notch. The roast beef is off the chain!!!! To taste roast beef with such a rich flavor and be extremely moist and delicious and don't even get me started on their bread. I mean sturdy enough to hold the heaping mounds of meat and toppings and yet still be delicate enough to yield a soft and airy loaf. I'm a sucker for their original roast beef on garlic cheese bread. I love their chip selection, it's not your ordinary run of the mill variety but why would it be, nothing about this place is ordinary. I love eating the other half of my sandwich the next day, now that speaks volumes of a true roast beef sandwich. The portions are large enough for me to eat half and be full and enjoy the rest for breakfast or dinner the next day. This place reigns supreme in the sandwich world!!! They're knocking it out of the park every time. You can't go wrong with whatever you select. I've tried 3 different sandwiches and everything has been delicious. It's real quality ingredients done right with a whole lot of love.",2
5,Food was great and we had a large party so they put us up in sporty's pub. The crab cakes and crab balls were good. Really good time and would recommend to anyone just walking around.,2
5,"Love love LOVE this place!!  We moved to the area from out of state shortly before I got pregnant, so I was really hoping to meet some other local pregnant women.  I've been doing the prenatal yoga classes and they are amazing!  Abby is a fabulous instructor, and all the women who work at the facility are really friendly and helpful.  I felt welcome the second I walked in the door.  I've also been taking their Lamaze birthing class which has been great.  Rachel teaches with a perfect mix of ""natural"" but also giving us a lot of useful medical knowledge.  I've been able to meet a lot of other great pregnant women throughout these experiences and I'm so grateful!",2
4,Ordered veggie bowl that was delicious.  One thing is I left still hungry. I think the portion is overpriced  ($14). I'll probably never come back again considering I left hungry after waiting 45 minutes. The people are chill and I appreciate the family presence here. I happened to be sitting at the bar next to the owner. The bar tender is her son. He was really nice.,2
5,"Great place up on the mesa near lazy acres.  They have really good japanese food and give you a ton for the money.  I used to get takeout here a lot, but it's a good place to eat in as well.  I'm not a sushi guy, but I've been told that theirs is very good!",2
4,"Ideal la forma como la espera a las afueras del local, se compesa con visitas cortas a las tiendas alrededor, antes de una notificación por sms... La atención un tanto impersonal, pero la comida vale la pena... ahora, los precios no reflejan la realidad... se paga un premium por la fama",2
4,"My husband and I have eaten at M3 at least six times, and each meal has been delicious. The mini tacos with braised beef are a meal, as is the quesadilla. I recommend ordering them with a side of M3's slaw, which is a fresh blend of apples, carrots and cabbage. The Pasta Rustico is outstanding and something you can't get anywhere else. We've tried three sandwiches: lamb burger, prime rib dip and bacon & cheese melt. We recommend all of them. I'll gladly add the 5th star as soon as they develop a cocktail menu. :)",2
4,"At least 7 of the best Korean dishes in Nashville reside here.  Basically each korean restaurant does a dish better than others.  So, you really have to know what to order.  That's true at many restaurants.   Larger asian populations have better asian restaurants.  3 star else where",2
5,We just had my daughter's first birthday party and ordered from Testa's the black-white cake with buttercream frosting.  We also ordered a single mini-sized same cake just for my daughter.  They were both delicious!  Service was exceptional.  They scanned a photo for the half-sheet (easily fed 30 ppl) and it came out great.,2
5,Short and sweet. I loved the food. The potion sizes are more than enough. I ordered the grilled chicken wrap. The chicken was well seasoned and very flavorful. The fries are delicious!,2
4,"This place is awesome. A real throwback. Music is great, 4 stars (not 5) as they don't really offer seating beyond the first 15 ppl in line.",2
5,Amazing food! This was purchased for myself and my co-workers for lunch recently and I had never heard of them but I really enjoyed it. I had the Tango Salad and it came with a baguette (that no one ate because they were pretty hard) and a cookie but still the food was awesome!,2
5,"This place is a gem and I highly recommend it.  I had read some really positive comments about it on Twitter, so I decided to try it today and I was not disappointed.  It's a bakery-coffee shop that also has a great lunch menu.  The food is expertly prepared and extremely creative.  They seem to specialize in pastries with interesting combinations of ingredients, for example today I had a savory tart with wild mushrooms and cheese, and there were tomato tarts and also one with beets that looked yummy. The mushroom tart I ate today was rich, buttery, and delicious. Of course, it's a bakery so they also have sweet baked things that looked very good.  They have sandwiches and salads that are just as creative as the baked goods:  this week they have a salad special with octopus and kale that looks so good from the photo they posted on Twitter and Facebook, it's haunting me and I might have to go back and try it for lunch tomorrow.  They also make their own bagels, which is super exciting for this born-and-raised-New Yorker. Everything is made fresh every day, I was told by the friendly, helpful man who waited on me at the counter.The place itself has a nice, clean, modern decor. It's a long, narrow space with the pastry counter-cash register towards the back, and about six or seven small tables running down the length of the room, with chairs and a comfortable bench with pillows. I didn't stay long today, but it looks like the type of place you could go hang out and drink coffee for a while, or go have lunch with a friend.  I don't even live Uptown, but I hope to become a regular at this place!Revised on 9/9/2013 to add:  I have been back here a few times, and I can now report that they have some of the best espresso drinks in the city!  Super yummy lattes.",2
5,Absolutely loved everything we ordered! We started with the bread board and it was delicious. I ordered the bacon egg and cheese on a croissant! They're croissants are to die for  we ordered a few different coffees and they were great! Mimosa was average.,2
5,"Great location. Great beer selection. You have many choices of beer on tap plus they have plenty of to go choices. No food here, but they usually have food trucks nearby. Enjoy a stroll on the green belt and stop by.",2
4,I've never eaten sushi and I went to this place.  I absolutely loved the Tucson rolls.   Yum!,2
3,"Ahh.  Ok, but not great.  Wait service was really poor and the wine list wasn't current/accurate.  Got same wine, wrong year and waiter didn't seem to understand.  Another at the table loved his dinner, mine was Ok but not great..",1
1,"Our sales person C.C was great she did everything she can to get me into the car, i was approved was handed the keys to the car etc. even had me put all my things from my trade in car to my new car, once we get to the finance dept. to sign the final paperwork, We were there for about 4hours that day, they tell me that they forgot to include sales tax from my lease trade in to the car I'm purchasing, which would bring my payments up to $24 per month which would bring my monthly payments to about $491 instead of the $461 we agreed on or i could pay the $930 est. now. I advise them all i could do was the amount we agreed on could not put down anything more. The next day i have Nick contact me and stated if i put down another $1,000 they could help me out, i stated  i could not, he basically told me that ""we are doing you a favor and helping you out due to your credit history, you could pay this now or later but you will have to pay the sales tax"". I felt like he was talking down to me and very unprofessional, i advised him could anything else be done since it was a error on there part, he basically stated no, and said if i could not make another $1,000 down on top of the $1,000 I' already putting down there nothing they could do, and kept saying we are bascially helping you out b/c of your credit history and just kept repeating it, when i stated i could not, he hung up the phone. This has been the worse delearship i honestly have been to, after spending 4hours on Saturday there and another 4hours on Monday..",0
5,"Never fails, this place is awesome. My personal faves tend to be the biscuit and the savory Dutch baby (regardless of toppings).",2
4,"You know the place must have good food when the average BMI of their patrons is 42. South Jersey has diners galore... which one to choose? WHICH ONE TO CHOOOOOSE?!?! Oh the options! Picked Meadow's Diner based on the reviews and was not disappointed. Came in at 10:30ish on a Saturday morning and while busy, I was still seated promptly and with a smile. Service was slightly lacking for refills on water but heeeeeey! It's JERSEY. I had the French Toast w/ Italian Sausage (which was homemade and very authentic [not to mention spicy]). The French Toast was fluffy but a bit cold. Boyfriend had some sort of artery clogging omelet which was very tasty but I'm sure it was about 5,000 calories (heeeeeeey! it's JERSEY!). Overall I good place to eat really fattening foods to give you the serious ITIS for about 12 hours. $50 for 5 people",2
4,"Talk about a little slice of SERENITY IN THE CITY!!!! I saw this place prior to construction; to say it's been a major overhaul and all for the better is putting it mildly. Former warehouse area, this transformation is a god-send.  A hidden gem, as you have to mount the 96 plus stairs, I counted, from the street to the park. Great hidden gem. This park came from the ashes of the Phoenix. Former wharfs used to sit here, now the area has been transformed into an oasis of serenity. Climb the 96 or so stairs, I counted, to gain access to a little piece of earthly heaven in the form of breathtaking views of the city. Seems to be something straight from a postcard. Way to go CITY OF NOLA, job well done. This park in the heart of the Marigny serves its purpose of promoting a day time get away.",2
4,"Wow...absolutely fantastic breakfast this morning...the special omelette was just out of this world and the coffee was the best I've had at a restaurant in a long long time...service was equally wonderful...great ambience, music, open feel... Definitely check this place out sooner rather than later...good job !",2
5,"The rating is, ""As good as it get,"" but honestly I'm not sure because this was my first time eating Moroccan food.I ordered the Shawarma cus I like the way it sounds.  With every bite the sandwich got better and better.  I didn't want it to end.  Mmmmm...kiss the cookStaff is friendly and answered questions...so plus 1 for that",2
3,"Arrived at 7:50am on the 5th of the month. Parked near the front door. Waited outside in line for it to open. Sat in the waiting room, breastfed and waited for about 40 minutes. I was number 55, but it seemed like they started on number 35. Getting the license went very quickly. The lady that helped me was super nice and loved seeing my baby boy who was with me. Don't forget CASH ONLY.",1
2,"The first time we went here, it was sometime around 7.  They were closed.  They don't close till 8:30.  So we came back a week later.  The burritos were cheap, but you get what you pay for.  They don't have a whole lot of flavor.  They're not really bad; it's just that there are way better options in Philly.  I don't know if there's much competition in UC for a casual take out burrito (it seems the good Mexican around here comes from lunch trucks), but if you have suggestions, pleast throw them my way.",0
3,"I know everybody seems to love this place but both times I've gotten attitude on trying to order simple things. i. e. An iced green tea. I basically ended up making it myself. Maybe I'm being a princess, but how difficult is it to make an iced green tea. I really would love to love this place, but no wifi. What?!?!? I'd park myself here regularly to work if they had wifi & yes that means I would be eating & sipping the whole time.",1
4,Great food. The owner was so nice.  Lacks a bit on atmosphere but makes up for it with the food.  Will return for sure the next time I'm in the area.,2
1,i didnt want to give up a star but... the place sucks!,0
4,"Had the Fried Rice with shrimp, the Mac and Cheese and the Hush Puppies, along with a glass of their ever so addicting Lemonade. I could've sat at one of the outdoor tables last night and been content drinking nothing but lemonade.The Fried Rice came with a huge chunk of avocado, which I can never get enough of. And the shrimp inside the rice was beyond amazing. Spices galore on that dish, hard to tell which ones were in play, but very well prepared.The guy who brought our food out was a little odd, said he didn't know what food was which, that was an experience.The Hush Puppies were just okay, after reading something about them I expected more.The Mac and Cheese was beyond decadent. And should be the first thing you order when going there. There was a ketchup that a friend of mine had on his plate that had some odd spicy kick, it was out of this world. We tried to find out what was in it but we forgot. Honey's is a can't miss restaurant, if you have a big party, be prepared for a bit of wait....sometimes.",2
4,"The best restaurant I've been to on the Main Line until now... But, ok, it's true the Main Line is probably not the best place to hang around.Food and service were pretty good, the place is nice, neither chic neither cheap. Don't expect excellence, but a really  good deal for what you get.",2
5,"My fiancé and I came here a couple weeks ago when we had to pick up one of our cars from a friend. We split their special, the Hawaiian Chicken Sliders and the Basket of Texas Toothpicks. The Toothpicks came out pretty quickly and the the Sliders came out not too long afterwards. The Toothpicks were cooked and seasoned well and the sliders were full of flavor, I wish we had ordered more! The service was pretty great as well. Our waitress was really nice and attentive to if we needed something. We even forgot one of our wallets on the table and a hat, coming out twice to give them to us. Thank you for that! We will definitely be back.",2
5,"My family and I came to visit Reno for a weekend and we came here two days in a row because it was just that good! The first night we came in looking for some good boba and a crispy chicken snack, and boy did we find something much more! This place does it all with their Taiwanese snacks. My dad told me it reminded him of actual Taiwan because everything was so authentic! We ordered the crispy chicken snack, the clam soup, and some green bean smoothies and it was just amazing!The following day we came back for the braised pork and egg rice, the beef noodle soup, the green onion pancake, salt and pepper chicken wings, and some more green bean smoothies. Definitely didn't disappoint the second time around either :)",2
5,Awesome! Loved this place. Great little breakfast joint easy walk south of route 90. Easy walk from French Quarter and surrounding areas. We got the bananas foster and it was incredible. Great decorations and colorful setting that feels like how you'd expect New Orleans to feel. Highly recommend.,2
4,"This place is a little harder to find but worth the hunt. B's Diner is a little hole-in-the-wall joint populated by neat antiques, funny posters, and the warmth and personality of their staff. They do incredible work in the community and they are worth supporting.If you are looking for an affordable meal or are looking to have a hearty bite at somewhere chill- this is your spot. It's got that great diner feel and the personality is all in the food.I think part of the fun is the people-watching at this joint. Whyte ave bar staff the morning after, hipsters, musicians- never a dull moment.I've heard the Elk sausage and perogie poutine is amazing, but I've yet to try it.",2
5,"I LOVE RALPHS.. My now Ex Husband ""Lenny"" used to bring me here all the time.. The food is scrumptious.. The mussels red or white are to die for.Food is always fresh and prepared to order. The Owners 'Jimmy and Eddie"", super nice, very accomodating and made me feel like family... Ronnie too!!I always left here in a food coma... Highly reccommend this wonderful Restuarant.. Gets very busy especially on weekends....Always a great dining experience!!",2
4,"This is probably the best buffet I've been to in Reno.  However, the dessert section sucked.",2
2,"So...we visited GC for the first time on a rainy Thursday evening.  Hubby and I really like beer, but not all beer (we're not easy), so we were looking forward to trying this place.  It was packed, we waited about 30 minutes for our table...not bad.  The place is new.  Our server was trying really hard; a friendly guy, he was very enthusiastic.  He did forget to put in our food order, but he came by and told us of his mistake and offered a free app.   I had the Northern Lights Lager.  I really like lagers and wheat beers.  I'm NOT an ale girl at all so I was pleased to see choices other than ales (I'm looking at you Boscos and Cool Springs Brewery).  My husband ordered the American Wheat.  They were both OK, nothing special.  I had the tomato/basil flatbread, I wouldn't go back for that but I've had worse.  Overall we decided that we wouldn't break our necks to get back there but if we were with people who wanted to go...we wouldn't veto the choice either.  Not worth the ""A"" in ""A-OK"" for 3 stars.  It's a solid 2.5 ""OK"".  But since this is a new semester, I can't go around handing out half stars willy nilly.  We'll see...",0
2,We live close by so decided to go here. Not up to expectations. The tv's were blasting loud and the place was not that clean especially considering how few people were in there. The food was very average. There are a lot of other better options out there.,0

It is pricey, but we have learned to really look at the prices and have found that there is plenty of ways to cut, bying the whole foods brand really helps. Everything is good here, the people are always friendly.",2
4,"Cellini is a hidden gem in the SOG area. Located on the corner of Interbay and Bayshore, Cellini offers fresh flavors and authentic favorites. Their pizza is some of the best in South Tampa, especially the Country which consists of sundried tomatoes, goat cheese, and pesto sauce. Another favorite of mine is their Rigatoni Vodka, which is some of the best vodka sauce I have ever had. Cellini also has one of the best wine collections in the SOG area.",2
4,"A great restaurant to take people visiting from out of town. Very popular for breakfast/brunch on the weekends. Should expect to wait at least an hour any time after 9:30 AM and service takes a little while. But great menu options and delicious food. Also a great bakery, coffee and gelato counter that offers instant service or items to enjoy while waiting to get called.",2
5,"oh.  my.  god.  i went here for south street's ""restaurant week"" (3 courses, 30$) last weekend and it was amazing.  And that should say a lot considering that a lot of restaurants use restaurant weeks to half-assedly  crank out dishes for the masses in an assembly-line manner.  But not here.every dish was excellent, and even artistic!  I had the avocado ceviche, barbacoa (perfectly cooked), and chocolate souffle cake with cajeta ice cream.  We also ordered the custom-made guacomole for the table; a server came out and made it for us right at the table. And just as swiftly as he had made it, the four of us devoured it.  SO good.  And the waitress was super-attentive and more than willing to offer recommendations.On top of everything, the place has a very cool atmosphere and is on a stretch of south street which is very pretty, especially on a temperate spring/summer night--perfect for a little post-dinner stroll or if you're en route to some bar hopping later.Try this place--you won't regret it.",2
4,Place is on the edge of the French Quarter in more ways than one. But the coffee was good and a cool coffee shop.,2
3,Tasty food but appears to be crashing slowly. We had trouble finding the entrance as the old entrance has closed. The food was really good but a bit pricey. A great experience but I think their hay day is over :-(,1
5,"Great environment, you can smell the bbq down the street. Pulled chicken and brisket were tender, juicy and seasoned perfectly.  Baked beans were the best I ever had!! Everything was cooked perfectly, we will visit again!!!! Love this place!!! Bring your appetite!!!",2
4,"Another stop in the desperately hip district of Edgehill.  Much like the other places of business in the area, Edgehill Studios pushes its post-modern architecture and ultra-trendy atmosphere on its customers.  However, because the sandwiches are affordable and because it's so conducive to laptopers, I had to give the place a star more than my gut wanted me to.They make a decent cup of coffee, and prices and selection are similar to places like Portland Brew and Bongo Java.  Apparently they don't serve soup through the summer (a bit of a bummer since I am a year round soup junkie), but their selection is fairly diverse for such a small cafe.Edgehill Studios Cafe has more room than I expected, and it typically isn't too busy, so it's an alright spot to duck in and do some web surfing.  The staff is quick and friendly, and it's usually pretty quiet.  I haven't visited the actual studio or been on an evening with live music, but I imagine it is pretty par for a coffee shop/venue.  I deem Edgehill Cafe worthy of your business, but I just can't quite make it a regular stop.  I'll stick to Portland Brew.",2
1,"One of the worst places in Tucson!  Cold food , rude service. They have the right idea but fail to deliver",0
3,"I love the owner!  He's amazing!!  The only complaint I have is that the service from the server's isn't that fabulous.  We had our rehearsal dinner here and while the food was OK, the service wasn't good at all.  We waited so long for food and just refills.  My husband and I visit this restaurant for ourselves and have no issues but I would not recommend having a large crowd here.",1
1,"Three out of four times I came for servicing (oil change, tire replacement, and inspection) I had an early morning appointment and was told they probably couldn't get the job done....it got done, but took several hours. Today, I went in for oil change (no appointment) ready to drop my car off for the day and was told (after waiting in line for 25 min) that there were no available appointments for 3 days. This location clearly can't handle basic servicing, so they surly won't  have to worry about my car anymore.",0
5,"I've only had the sushi and it was pretty good. I want to try the Chinese food, and will update once I do.",2
2,"A group of five went late in the evening and experienced poor service. The restaurant was clean and there are a lot of tv's to watch sports but not recommended for an enjoyable dining experience. The food was good but overpriced in my opinion. Also, gratuity is added to your ticket. We had a terrible waitress who got drink orders incorrect, forgot silverware, was completelyunpleasant, and never checked on us.",0
5,Had the chicken shawarma and it was fantastic! All the ingredients were nice and fresh and the food was so cheap! Great place to grab takeout on a week night.,2

4,"I enjoyed the small, family vibe of this healthy brunch spot. Located off the beaten path in New Orleans lower Garden District, Surrey's offers a lot of cleaner alternatives to the biscuits and gravy you'll find slopping up other breakfast menus in the area. When you want a fresh squeezed juice and a veggie-friendly bite, this place is a good bet. We got the creole baked eggs and Migas with chorizo. Both were a hearty portion served alongside corn tortillas as a gluten-free alternative! The wait time for a table was long, but the service was friendly! I'd recommend to my friends who prefer lighter fare in a clean, local-centric environment.",2
4,"First time here so I was surprised when I was told ""We're here"". This is it. Wow! Interesting because I would have kept on driving. Truth: I don't think there was a sign visible on the outside.  I love it! Lots of tasty choices. I was eager to try the Sonoran hotdog. My first. Maybe I'm use to a simple grilled dog. It was ok. I didn't taste the bacon. And I love my bacon! Definitely upgrade to the beer battered fries. My nephew had them with his burger.  We could not keep our hands out of his basket. I should have stayed with my standard: burger. They had a delicious selections. No desserts btw. I'm not a beer drinker but I do enjoy a good craft beer. I especially love trading the seasonal ones.  Our nameless server took our drink order but didn't mention the new ones on the board.  I gave her a list for my flight including the beer she liked. When I'm stuck on a decision,  I ask our server what they typically order whether it be app, entree, dessert, or drink. Usually they enthusiastically tell what they love on the menu. Miss Nameless shrugged & pointed to her fav.  I couldn't even remember what it was. I did enjoy the NCAALE & the mocha java porter. The other one was the raspberry. I'm giving Barrio 4 stars due to the service.  The bartender who helped me with the shuffleboard pucks was a helpful cutie tho. All in all I would come back again due to the atmosphere & menu.",2
5,My friend recommended this place and I am glad she did! The room was very cute! We got the king room with hot tub and fireplace. Utilized both and had such a romantic weekend. It was pretty close to everything too. The only negative is the TV is pretty old but we barely watched TV. Plus is they have an iHome dock station that is compatible with iPhone 5's and newer.,2
4,"A girlfriend and I stopped by this adorable cupcake shop after eating lunch today. She raved about how good they are and so I bought four for my family. I had the Dark Chocolate with chocolate sprinkles. The icing was so delicious, the cake was nice and moist...I'm just not a cake person. Now if the cake part had some dark chocolate chips incorporated in the cake, then I'd be a huge fan! The decor is fun and it's in hip 12 South. Sprinkles even has a cupcake ATM for after hours...pretty cool!",2
5,"This place has phenomenal food from start to finish. The brussel sprouts were so savory, we ordered two helpings. We also had two of the chicken tacos, and two of the braised short ribs. For dessert, I believe we had something chocolate, and definitely delicious. We actually went to this place back in April but as I'm sitting in another restaurant telling my friend about our experience at this place, I thought I should write them a review since it was so worthy!",2
5,Hands down the best spaghetti & meatballs I've ever had. The atmosphere here is so nice and cozy. It has just won out as my favorite Italian restaurant.,2
5,"This place is excellent. I'm an amateur photographer and I have come here for multiple workshops because the education, the teachers, and the facilities are excellent. In terms of those workshops you can find them for about $30 on Groupon or LivingSocial and the classes are intimate enough with about seven people or less that you really can get the individual attention that really makes for an excellent experience. In fact you will get that personal attention because the teacher incorporates each student and politely requests that they offer their work for light critique. There are opportunities in every class for you to go outside and practice what you just learned by shooting on the surrounding streets.My only criticism regarding the workshops is that they are not as frequent as I would like as my weekend work schedule conflicts often times with their classes.This next section is about the print center and I've had nothing but a phenomenal experience there. I was completely new to Printing and Keith the master printer who runs the lab made an appointment and sat with me for about an hour to basically guide me through the entire process, give his suggestions, and work Photoshop to get the photos exactly as I want them. He has a profound amount of experience that he draws from and is completely understanding that I am a brand new printer. He even gave me recommendations for where to get my photos framed and was just a brilliant lead in the entire process of printing my photographs. I'll definitely come back and I will recommend it to you because they do have excellent facilities, friendly workers, and a wealth of experience.The actual building itself is quite large and I believe it's shared with some other organizations. Philadelphia photo Arts Center does have a classroom or two and a nice gallery to present whatever work they choose.Getting here is very convenient as I take the subway from Center City and walk about 10 minutes. If you were to drive there's plenty of parking and it does not seem packed the numerous times I've been there.",2
4,Love that this place has side booths and back rooms where you can sit at low-lying tables in a more traditional Japanese fashion. Makes an outing that much more fun!The prices are decent and the sushi's very good. It's alwasy very fresh and there are many kinds of specialty rolls to choose from!,2
5,"We checked in to the hotel later in the evening and commented on the new look and feel of the place. The front desk staff noted they just opened the facility the week before, so it is a brand new hotel!It was a great experience and fair price. Extra bonus being one of the first to stay in the new facilities.Breakfast was good and all the staff very friendly. Overall a great experience. Great location with easy access to to major roads and points of interest.",2
5,I went in today because of neck and shoulder pain. Marisa was awesome. I've never experienced a massage like this before. She did a deep tissue massage and stretched my body as well. I already feel better and it's 5 hours later. I'm definitely going back to her soon!,2
5,"Had a great experience today with my tech and carpet cleaning service.  Donte arrived early and took his time: setting up, pre-treating heavily soiled areas and worked his way from upstairs to downstairs. I couldn't believe the results! Didn't have great expectations with the high traffic soiled areas and stairs but I was unexpectedly blown away. My carpet looks gorgeous, the nap is nice, soft and fluffy. I'm amazed and impressed! Totally satisfied! Thanks COIT and Donte!",2
1,"How has this place survived???? In Germantown no less?!?!?!? The old guy behind the counter (I'm assuming he's the proprietor) was unwelcoming, surly, and kinda rude. I only ordered a cheesesteak with fried onions...admittedly without looking at the menu..and when he told me it was $8.90, I thought I jumped into a wormhole and was in South Philly at Pat's or Geno's. Let me just jump to my summation...it wasn't worth $8.90. Did they pass a new cheesesteak tax too??? It's all good and lesson learned. I will be going back to the papi stores and getting a much better cheesesteak for half the price. And they should be ashamed for fleecing people for using credit/debit cards. Hell..they even charge more for SPENDING more. Who does that????",0
5,Not only is the ice cream del kilos but hey have unique yummy flavors.I got the dipped waffle cone with three scoops: red velvet: tastes just like red velvet cakeCaramel cone; swirls of caramel and chunks of waffle cone Mocha caramel pecan: coffee ice cream with swirls of caramel and crispy pecans Can you tell I like caramel?! And yes I shared....,2
5,Absolutely the best Mexican food in Port Richey!  I''ve tried them all.  Great waitress too.,2
5,"I just went for the first time and this place is AMAZING!!! I tried the chicken sandwich and it was incredible. Hot, crispy, juicy, tender and flavorful all at once. I can't wait to try one of the donuts. I might go back tomorrow...",2
2,"Straight to the point, it's cheap, it tastes and feels cheapThe good: price, location, dessert (edible food items are: baked chicken, fried chicken, mashed potatoes, Salad bar lol, meat and cheese bar, ravioli, pizza) also our waitress was bomb afThe meh: behind counter meat slicing station, shrimp (not even deveined), Mexican stationThe bad: breakfast -worst eggs ever, actually worst, eggs. Le Benedict can't even cut through ham or English muffin (tried on all 3 occasions), steak, shrimp again, hell breaded items can't even, don't even. Decor it's the 1970 nightmare you can imagineTried 3 times and failed",0
5,Our stay here was fantastic. The rooms are very modern and spacious. The staff was very friendly in helping us with any questions. The rooms are very quiet and the beds are extremely comfortable.,2
5,"My wife and I have gone here 5 times now in the last couple months. We love it! Savory food. Great pulled pork and chicken. We've gotten the sandwiches, ribs, salads, baked potatoes, and mac and cheese here - never in one sitting, haha. We keep trying more items, because everything we've had so far here is delicious! The one thing we do continuously get is a glass of Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale, they even have it on tap - very hard to find in the Indy area!  Love the atmosphere too. It's not huge inside, so you may wait a while if you have a large group. There are fun things to check out near by too, like Dare Devil Brewery and AJ Foyte's winery.",2
4,"The guy at the counter actually told me i made a good choice just going with mustard and pickle on my hot pastrami because it brings out the pastrami flavor... since thats what i wanted and dude agreed thats the right way... well... he knows a good pastrami as i do...like this place...my wife got a sandwich of some sorts that she was very happy with too... anytime im in that area needin a pastrami, thats where ill go",2
5,"Waxing services by Wendy are amazing!  As always, a wonderful experience!  The atmosphere is calming and relaxing. I can't say enough about Alston Face and Body!",2
2,"This place gets two stars from me only because the gravy fries were good. Their sandwiches are awful. Thick slabs of badly sliced, tough, dry meat....gross. I made the mistake of ordering their pork sandwich once and it was inedible. I tried to bite into the sandwich and couldn't even bite through because of how tough and rubbery the pork was. I don't understand why they slice the meat the way they do but it makes for a disgusting sandwich. The people raving on how good this place is are just locals who have never had anything better. You're better off going to Wawa for a sandwich. Seriously. It will at least be edible.",0
2,"Took my son's phone in to repair the 3rd cracked screen.  They are fast, I'll give them that, but now the ringer doesn't work.  Not so good when you're trying to find your kid....",0
4,"I love driving on the Benjamin Franklin Bridge. Every time I go up to NJ, I make sure I take this bridge. The view from the bridge is amazing. I love the waterfront PA/NJ scenery. It's best to have EZ Pass during busy times. The EZ pass makes getting through the tolls a lot smoother. If you are riding across the Benjamin Franklin Bridge, enjoy the waterfront view.",2
5,"I'm coming up on my 2nd anniversary of regularly visiting Springtime Fitness, and it seems high time to write a review. When I moved into this neighborhood and stumbled upon Springtime, I was pretty out of shape and suffering from chronic back pain. Enter Lisa. She is a fantastically knowledgable instructor with a keen eye and deep knowledge of body mechanics. She worked with me to develop proper alignment, core strength and flexibility. Over the past two years, I've gotten strong, my posture is better, my stamina has improved significantly. And, my core, leg and arm strength have made me much more resilient - I've even started running again (haven't done that for years). Over the two years at Springtime, I've expanded my fitness regime to include training on Red Cord with Peter Madden, and on Gyro with Joyce Chen. This is all in addition to the still challenging Pilates work outs with Lisa.  It's great to be able to engage in a dynamic fitness program that constantly challenges and evolves to keep me growing and improving. Plus the space has tons of natural light and a bank of windows with a private garden view - lovely. So, thank you Springtime Fitness, Lisa, Peter and Joyce, and happy anniversary!",2
1,"Even one star is too much. Rude, slow and ignorant staff. We waited more than 45 minutes only for one scrambled egg. Finally one of the staff came and said that they could not make our order since they were so busy and apologized. However the restaurant was half-empty and quite. In the meantime, we saw customers that arrived after us but received their food and drinks earlier. Disgusting. I think this restaurant likes big orders. They put big orders in the priority. Unprofessional.I would never come back. Don't waste your time here. Try other places nearby",0
4,"Surprisingly nice inside! The food was a little pricey, but delicious! The toasted ravioli were okay.The pink sauce on my pasta side was great!",2
5,This place had fantastic donuts! They were very well priced and so soft. We tried the blueberry cake donut and apple fritter. We will definitely be going back.,2
5,We visited one morning for brunch and were very impressed! We started with fried green tomatoes and they were amazing!! Seriously the best fried green tomatoes we have ever had. The catfish and grits were also very good. Excited to return for dinner and listen to some jazz music!,2
5,"If I could rate 500 stars instead of 5, I would.Khmer Kitchen is, to me and many others, the place to get the legit Southern style Vietnamese food that no Vietnamese restaurant in the USA would ever have the balls to serve, because they can't be bothered to go outside their lazy comfort zone business-wise. Mind you, it's hard to draw the line between dishes of Cambodia and South Vietnam because four score and seven years ago, Cambodia was continuous with South Vietnam (go ahead, google it, it's called the Khmer Empire and it lasted for more than half a millennium). Think of it as fusion cuisine, but neither of those cuisines are Westernized, so your flavors just go BAM. Prah-Hok Kateeh - The must-order appetizer dish under the Traditional Khmer Dish section of the menu. The ground pork dip is flavored with a fish paste that has a very subtle pungent yet light aroma, balancing well with the fresh Khmer vegetable selection such as Thai and purple eggplant, carrot, cabbage, long bean (not the typical American green bean). That light pungent-ness is just so pleasureable!Sah-Law Machue Yuin (with Tilapia) - This is what the Vietnamese call ""canh chua"" but it's a zillion times more authentic than the versions you'll find in most Vietnamese restaurants in the USA. Beautifully tangy tamarind flavor broth with tons of garlic, and it's best to order this dish with the tilapia as this is the correspondingly traditional protein choice. Cha Kr'ung (with Frog) - Standard South Vietnamese bar fare, and we ordered it with the frog with was delicious and was a nice white meat with an almost fall-off-the-bone quality, without actually falling off the bones until we actually needed it to. Be forewarned from ordering it ""spicy"" - the waiter asked us if we wanted it this way, and we said yes, not realizing that this place uses Asian standards of spicyness. Just about everyone at our table was ready to choke on the level of spiciness, and I thought we were pretty strong. However, the coconut broth balances out the spice so well, that we suffered through the pain because it was so damn amazing.Sah-Law Ka-Koe (with pork) - waiter's choice when we asked him for an entree that was ""not sweet"" and very traditional. It's got some sweet-ish pumpkin in it but otherwise the dish is a soupy slightly creamy dish with lemongrass mixed with seafood-y paste flavor, and lots of chopped Thai eggplant. We ordered this with pork as the waiter told us this was the traditional way. This dish also resembles a traditional Vietnamese dish (which just about no Vietnamese restaurants in the US dare to serve) ""canh ca dang"". I have a hard time describing the taste other than it is ""earthy""?",2
4,"Spontaneous stop for dinner. Samosa for a shared appetizer, lamb curry and a delicious vegan entree. Perfect rice and spice. Good wine selection and pours.",2
2,Disappointed. The bread was not fresh. I had the grilled seafood mix and it was all dry and overcooked. It's a good place for tourists. The large aquarium is a draw. The seafood was not.,0
1,"We went here, on advice from a newspaper review.  What a disappointment!  The bread was like Wonder Bread, with a dipping ""marinara"" that was red just like sauce straight from a can, no simmering! The food all lacked flavor, and that is being very kind & considerate!",0
5,"After reading positive reviews, we decided to try it .  We loved the food!  Great flavors.  I had the seafood tacos which were better than any I have tried in the Reno area.  Husband had chile verde... loved it.  Small location with very personable staff.  We will return even tho it is a drive from south Reno. :-)",2
5,"Such a great place to skate at, hanging-out with Family and friends. The staff here at Coachlite are super friendly.",2
5,"The best! The staff are the cutest, friendliest people you'll ever meet. Food came out quick, reasonably priced, delicious and as described in the menu. They also serve these funky chips to eat while you're waiting on your meal. Would definitely recommend if you enjoy Thai.",2
5,"This was a great experience for me! Just what I wanted my wedding dress experience to be! Jayna was so sweet and really listened to the type of dress/style that I wanted.  She was actually the one who picked my wedding dress from the rack!  She just knows what looks good on people.  Loved my experience here and definitely recommend The Dress.  Also, have her do your alterations- she knows what she is doing!",2
4,OMG! Breakfast pizza and bottomless mimosas and bloody marys. Is there anything better in this world? Even got a handshake on the way out the door. Service like that seems scarce these days,2
3,"I was craving a burger, and since we'd driven past this place a few times, we decided to check it out!Pros: The chili cheese fries were REALLY good! The chili tasted and looked homemade (not the canned stuff) and was a huge portion. That could have been my entire meal by itself.Cons: The worst thing was that the cashier was also assembling the food when she wasn't handling the money. She did NOT wash her hands OR wear gloves after touching people's cash and credit cards, itching her nose, wiping sweat off her forehead......and then just going straight back to arranging hamburger buns with their fixings with her bare dirty hands. GROSS. Nobody else seemed to notice, nor care. The burgers were just okay. Not bad, but we were expecting better. The wait was soooo long. We must have stood there waiting for over 25 minutes ( for two burgers, chili fries, and cheese fries). It was about a half hour before closing and they were not allowing anyone to sit inside at the tables because they'd already been cleaned for the day. There were only two picnic tables outside to sit at. One man came in a little while before closing, and they told him they couldn't serve him. Since they were obviously still cooking and serving other people (that had arrived earlier), he was NOT happy. He stormed out and said, ""Fine buddy, but you've just lost a customer"".  I get that they were closing soon, but what's one more order before locking the doors?Despite all the cons, I loved the chili cheese fries so much that I will be going back for more! We just won't be getting any burgers. I'd like to try their milkshakes and their pesto chicken sandwich, too.",1
5,"I feel strange knocking back the star rating just because I don't always like their hot food bar, so I'm not going to. I stop here A LOT, TOOO MUCH for lunch and I've become familiar with the things that they do well and the things they don't. Even their soups can sometimes be bland and sad. I still appreciate their food though, on a busy day when you want something wholesome it's one of the only places to run in and out, well near my work anyway. I have to say their breakfast bar on Saturdays and (I think also on Sundays) pretty much blows the one at Whole Foods out of the water. In fact I would say their hot bar is just better than all the hot bars at Whole Foods combined. So take that.",2
1,New Orleans use to be all about service. My wife and I were running a few minutes late because our 1 year old needed to be changed right as we left the house. Mr B's would not seat my father until we arrived. It is time for Mr B's to get with the times.,0
5,Super Fun place that we happened on by chance during our weekend child free get-a-way.  This place made me wish I had brought my kids along.  It is a great family spot with really amazingly good food!  We will be back!,2
5,"Fair Wheel Bikes is likely the most knowlegable road bike pro shops in the country.   Whatever is unique, super-light, ultra-trick, and exotic, fairwheel has the skinny and means to acquire it.Way beyond the typical realm of bike shops, these guys are unique in every way.  These guys do business worldwide for a good reason.",2
3,"Food here is mediocre, not great and not that bad. The pad thai had too much carrots mixed in with it, imo. My pineapple fried rice was ok. Boyfriend's spicy noodles were ok as well. I am visiting from San Francisco where there are a ton of excellent Thai restaurants so I can be a bit picky. I suppose this is good enough for Santa Barbara. Maybe go here if you are really craving Thai, but pass if you are looking for a memorable meal.",1
3,"My husband and I trekked from Memphis to St. Louis at the beginning of April for the USWNT soccer game at Busch Stadium. We arrived in St. Louis with a few hours to spare before game time, so we headed over to a burger joint, Bailey's Range, for lunch (I had found it ahead of time via Yelp, naturally). This restaurant was only a few blocks from the stadium and was buzzing with patrons. After fasting for Good Friday, a nice juicy burger accompanied with some fried pickles, french fries, and an ice-cold Coke sounded just right. The space itself was very neat, with large downstairs and upstairs dining areas. There was also an ice cream station at the front of the restaurant, which we sadly did not partake in. The service was a bit slow due to the mad rush of soccer fans that they clearly were not expecting, so we were efficient whenever our waitress came by and ordered everything that we needed at once. We started with the fried pickles appetizer. The batter was very good and I was suprised to see that the dish included different types of pickles. We then each ordered our burgers (me - the basic burger, my husband - the American burger). Both burgers were cooked to our preference and the toppings were nice, but nothing to write home about. The standout dish was the french fries (note - the large french fry is HUGE, two people could easily split the smaller portion). The ketchup accompanying the fries was very interesting - was there ginger in there? Who knows, but it was good! I would definitely recommend this burger place to anyone traveling to St. Louis.",1
3,"Good menu. Good food, good beer selection. The brick chicken was cooked perfectly. Our only problem w/ the food was that a couple items were heavily salted, the baked kale and the spring rolls being the big offenders. The big reason I took to yelp was because of the SLOW service!! it took us over 2.5hrs for my friends and I to have dinner. We had to ask for bread and oil (which was delicious) but slow service was brutal to sit through and their wasn't much apology for the delays, just... ""the gratuity is circled at the bottom of the check""  THANKS!",1
1,I got very sick and unfortunately gave my cat a few bites of my chicken and it ended up costing me $300 in vet bills and my cat almost died.The manager responded and tried to blame us for this issue.Very professional Glen G. I assume he is uneducated and lacking in any skills.,0
5,"What a great addition to the Funk Zone!  Grab a bite, grab some tastings, life is good. Right next door to the Santa Barbara Wine Collective, in fact it actually shares the same tables.  We had a fabulous savory croissant.",2
5,"I had a little Happy Hour dinner here with my girls after work. Great location, right down the street from Rosalita's. I arrived early and got a table for the four of us. Our waitress was awesome, very welcoming and knowledgeable. I started off with the red pepper and gouda soup- just as wonderful as it sounds. Plenty of substance, not overly cheesy - very filling for a soup. Everyone else got one of the signature martini's. Everyone loved them, except two people with the same martini complained their drinks were dissimilar, and the waitress and bartender quickly corrected it, no problem. They have small plates there, which aren't my thing, but the one person in my party who got one liked it.  There was a fish special that looked and apparently tasted delicious. At the end, we each got desserts. This is definitely a dessert bar- the portions were huge. I seriously thought they brought me two. I ordered a blondie, and received a large brownie AND a nice portion of ice cream- I was in heaven; just as delicious as it looked. Great service, great food, great dessert. All I need. On another note, I love that they had several areas, a bar, an area with tables by the window, and two sections with more personal seating, sofas and comfy chairs in the back. Really something for everyone, except for people expecting big burgers...",2
3,"This just isn't A-OK. It's just not. I wish it were. Alas... it's getting 3 stars for balance. 2 stars seems harsh for a random act of poor service (plus, once the lead server / bartender recognized negligence he took care of the situation). Why are there only two servers handling an entirely packed Friday lunch hour? If we cracked the books on human lunch behavior I'd guess that we'd see a spike in pizza eating on Fridays (lower stress) and Mondays (higher stress). I'd imagine that'd it be a good thing to always have extra staff on hand at any lunch spot downtown -- especially one that offers beer, sports, and pizza -- and especially one that has slowly built a pretty solid foundation for itself in just under a year. Alas... we waited. And waited. I could go on & on about how we waited. The saving grace? Sun King's Oktoberfest on draft touching my stomach. Once that happened... the business is guaranteed 3 stars. What's that Jon? Why? Well.. think about it. This business has the choice every day to serve swill or serve local suds. At the end of every day they consider the beer they have to put in an order for. They've maintained their commitment to local beer (probably because people are finally drinking it). With that, you're A-OK friend (or at least until SKB takes over every single bar in the city or they start serving their suds at a mortuary that's posing as a pub -- sure a cool thought but think about it...). However... please note that the longer you make me wait for pizza the higher the expectations are. Unlike when you make me wait for Sun King beer and then I have it, I know it will be great, I don't know for sure what this pizza will be like. Yes I ate it. Yes I generally liked it -- but that's because I generally like cheese, bread, cooked cheese on cooked bread (really, I'd eat any version of it, anywhere, anytime). Nevertheless, it just wasn't all that riveting (and yes when I'm eating pizza I want to be riveted like I'm watching Kirstie Alley woo Patrick Dempsey in Can't Buy Me Love). On a blustery day, a beer and cooked cheese and bread is perfect. I love walking in that alley. In fact, I close my eyes and think of the way this alley looked in 1907, and I especially close my eyes when I walk through the odd purgatory chamber of an office building hallway that you have to get through to get to the pub. When I open my eyes... I still find a place that serves $2 pints on Tuesdays, and for that you're A-OK.",1
4,"This is my first review so bear with me please.I am writing this review as i sit at La Va and generally speaking I am enjoying my time here. I am currently a resident of Chicago but am out in Philadelphia visiting some friends and La Va is probably cooler than any cafe I have been to thus far in Chicago, but mind you I have not been to many. The coffee is delicious and my friend informs me that the hot chocolate is just as good. I have also been told that the bagel and hummus, and croissant's are delicious. But as far as the quality of the coffee goes, I would give it two thumbs up. The ambiance is nice, there is plenty of seating and it seems that I have yet to walk into La Va without it being packed with people, which is a good and bad thing. Besides plenty of tables to sit at there are also comfy antique couches which add to the ambiance. The reason I have given La Va a four of of five is because that even though everything is delicious and the ambiance is great, it is really nothing new. It is what is to be expected from a ""coffee shop"" in a big city. Everything is in it's place; apple laptops, trendy baristas, indie rock in the background, comfy chairs and attractive pastries, but there is nothing to write home about besides it's ability to fulfill and potentially exceed one's expectations for a coffee shop.",2
5,"Stayed here two nights for a conference. The rooms were very clean, comfortable, and fairly modern looking. Convenient location, definitely safe. All staff was very friendly. Lobby is busy, but nice place to sit",2
2,"Our group had intended to sit out in the patio, but since It was too hot, we decided to sit inside the restaurant.  First impression; it was noisy and the decor needed some upgrading.  Our waiter came to our table and immediately wanted us to order appetizers even though the rest of the group was still parking their cars (incidentally don't go on a Wednesday in the summer, the parking lot is full due to people going to the farmer's market).  The waiter also behaved unprofessionally and kept interrupting and then didn't show up. When I ask if there is a charge for a substitution on the side dish, he said it would only be $1 extra. After we placed our order, it took a long time (at least 1/2 hour or more) to get our food. The dishes were just typical bar food and not particularly warm when they finally arrived at our table.  There's a great selection of good, quality beer, though. When we got our check, I noticed that I was charged $4.50 for the substitution of the side order.  When I questioned the waiter in the front of our group, he said that's what they charge and made no attempt to contact his manager to change it. He merely said that ""you got an extra large order"".  I didn't want an extra large order so again I ask if he would change it and he just shrugged his shoulders and left.  A few days later, I phoned the manager to let him know about our experience. He appeared to be concerned about the treatment we received. I mentioned to him that it had been my turn to pick a venue for our group and frankly, no one in our group was particularly pleased with the service.  I told him that I was calling because I don't like to put bad reviews on yelp and hoped that he would give extra training to his employee. He apologized profusely and said he would send me a gift certificate. I told that that it wasn't necessary but that it would be appreciated.  He said that he'd send one anyway and I gave him my address. I never heard back from him - not even a note. That was three weeks ago so here's my review.",0
5,"I hesitated to give 5 stars only because it is more of a take out place for me, but for what it is it deserves 5 stars.  This is not the sit down with a date kind of place (although their dining area is clean and well kept).  I think it is 5 star worthy for the quality of food you get for the price.I make crab rangoon and because of that I usually don't like restaurant's crab rangoon, but theirs is excellent.  Their dishes are also very fresh and flavorful.  My favorite is the Roast Pork in Garlic sauce which they modify for me to not be hot.I've never had a problem with the service, they are always very friendly and fast.Highly recommend!!",2
5,"Live music, nice patio seating, large bar with a second floor seating. Had the shrimp and crab and it was pretty good.  The bloody mary and the home made Pina colada was the bomb.",2
5,"I stopped by this place for an after school snack and am going to make it a weekly installment.  The owner was extremely helpful and welcoming and could tell that I didn't have any chaat experience, so he gave me a crash course.  We decided he would make me what he deemed to be a good chaat for ""beginners"" and he made me one of the best things I've ever eaten!  The flavors were so unique and balanced and went so well together!  The mango lassi was also delicious.  Definitely come here and try the chaat, even if you are new to it.  This place couldn't be friendlier!",2
1,"Had been there once before for a simple tune up, and everything went fine. That was back right after they opened, so I figured a simple state inspection would be no problem. Wrong!I dropped the car off on Saturday afternoon, and Miguel asked me if I wouldn't mind leaving it overnight in case they didn't finish before closing time on Saturday. I needed the car back the next morning, but Miguel assured me it would be done by the time they opened, at 10am. I called on Sunday at 10:30, and not only had the inspection not been done yet, ""they guy who does inspections didn't come in this morning."" So I went and took the car back, no inspection competed. Poor communication, complete absence of service, and no attempt ton even do the work they promised to do. I won't ever try them again.",0
5,"Amazing pizza. AMAZING! After my first bite, I felt like that Oprah Winfrey meme, where her head is thrown back, her mouth is agape and her arms are open wide, and she's screaming, ""You get a car!"" Except it's not Oprah, it's me. And I don't get a car -- I get a pizza. But I felt that excited.  This is basically the pizza I have been looking for since moving to the Indianapolis area. It's a whole lot of nothing: It's not cut into square pieces. It's not crispy and thin. It's not redolent of oregano. It's thick and chewy, cheesy, greasy, wonderful -- it tastes the way pizza is supposed to taste! I have found my new pizza home.",2
4,"I absolutely love this Market! I live in Southwest Philly, and I do not mind traveling to get what I love from this Market. The ground beef and babyback ribs are the freshest ever!!! Yes, it maybe a little pricy, but it's worth it! If I lived in Center City, I would shop there everyday! Literally! I highly recommend this for your grocery shopping!",2
5,St Mary's is always my first stop when getting into Tucson. Yes sometimes the wait is a little long but always worth it. I have never had a bad dish yet. I have been coming here for the last 18yrs and will continue to return. Portions are big so there is always enough to take home for later.,2
3,"Tried the pulled pork, green beans, Mac n cheese and cornbread. It was all pretty mediocre barbecue. Not bad, not great. The pork was a little overdone/dry, but had a nice smoky flavor. The original bbq sauce is pretty sweet/syrupy. Ill probably go back, but I wouldn't if there was a better option as close to my house.",1
2,I was in the neighborhood so I thought I'd stop buy to pick up some pork butt and some pork fat for making some sausage.  They actually argued with me and wouldn't go to the back to grab me the fat.  They had no idea that I was not making pork sausage but just using it as a filler meat to get up to the correct weight for the recipe.I should have known the quality of the business when I walked in and all of the refrigerated displays were empty and the only other customer in there was only picking up jugs of water lol.,0
5,"This is a nice, comfortable lounge in the Tuscany area of the Peppermill. Most nights there is mellow music to enjoy and the drinks are always strong and delicious. Happy hour is pleasing, with a discounted appetizer menu to choose from and yummy drink specials. The service is outstanding and the bar tenders are friendly. This isn't the place you would frequent to get loud and crazy with your friends. Rather, Terrace is an elegant bar that is perfect for sipping a cocktail with friends, spending a romantic evening with a loved one or even enjoying some low key gambling at the bar. The Terrace is a necessary stop when I visit the Peppermill.",2
5,"I have been using Jack Flash for 10 years. They provide exceptional service and work that is always priced-right. As a family-owned business, there's a personal touch to all the interactions I have with the employees. They are friendly and care about doing an exceptional job. They have:Rewired /rerouted electrical boxes in our homeAdded lights & fixturesFixed outletsIn one instance, they smelled gas leaking! It was a small leak that could have been something big. PECO fixed it!Jack flash is the best!10 stars!",2
4,"My husband just got his hair cut at this new salon with his favorite hair stylist, Susy Hurtado.  Susy has done such an awesome job with my husband's hair that he's stayed with her for over three years and followed her to salon renova. He also loves their conversations.  (Should I be jealous?  JK). Per my husband, ""The salon has a great atmosphere, a great location.  Easy parking.""  Also, he loves the sinks because they tilt and are so comfortable.",2
5,They make the best Flat Whites. Not to mention their beans are expertly roasted. The roaster knows about his coffees and ensures that the beans are sourced from respectable farms.,2
5,"The food was great, the service was quick, and the drinks were delicious. The servers have tablets now and it makes the food come out faster--someone actually brought drinks to our table while our server was still telling us about appetizers, how cool!",2
5,This is the best pizza in Roxborough!  The ingredients they use are top notch and they have such a variety of specialty pizzas.  I suspect the negative reviews are from competitors worried about their business!  The thin crust reminds me of the pizza I had in Italy.  The have a great deal for lunch or dinner...two huge slices and a soda for under $5.  I try to get there 3-4 times a week.   I can use my laptop in the dining area and also catch up on the news on the 2 HD tv's.    It's a great pizza!,2
3,"Cheap food and large selection. Unfortunately, they forgot our order, we waited 15 minutes and they were not even sorry about it. Bad customer service.",1
5,"Great company!!!  I called and they were able to come out same day to change 4 locks at our house.  They were professional, fast and very accomodating.  I had an issue with one of the lock alignments and they immediately sanded it down and fixed it.Overall great experience and highly recommend!",2
1,"This place is Smokey and insane...8 dollars for a drink at center bar , even if your playing the bar-top machines?? I know its not Vegas but come on, some tickets/vouchers I had from a month ago with money on the expired?? Why is that?? Even the stupid slots would not take em?? I had to go to meet a friend who spends a lot there, I was coughing my brains out from the smoke. I was stressed the whole time I was there,  as was my wife, it used to be fun, now it sucks.We eat at some of the restaurants weekly , but we are done. Now they want to re-do the lot and charge to park , what the hell is wrong with these greedy Indians or whoever is running this scam.Talk about driving people away, I know they don't care because its always packed house, the clientèle however has dropped to thugs and lowlifes. The parking garage is nasty like New Jersey...garbage all over,  stinks, gum on the ground, just shit. Now should I tell you what I really think??",0
2,"Not a great experience at this place. It's pretty basic Americanized sushi. A lot of people like that, I don't. The fish wasn't very fresh, not good quality and not cut properly. If you get something with ""crunchies"" or lots of sauce, then you'd probably like it here.",0
2,"Very small, overcrowded, and dirty. This it's my least favorite park I've been to in multiple states. I give it two stars because of the dock, but I did not get to go on it because I was with my chow chows.",0
5,The oysters are amazing and especially the warm chocolate mouse dessert!,2
5,"I've only eaten here once while coming back from decorating signs for Slutwalk in the Summer at Circle of Hope.  It's out of my hood; otherwise, I'd go more often. Their chicken salad wrap with pecans is one of the best fast food items I've ever had and is delicious. Same goes for the curly fries.",2
5,"Holy Crap! Square Donuts kick ass.  After seeing they were opening downtown a while ago, then stalking from afar for a few weeks (stupid health goals) I finally, FINALLY, let myself venture in and I was not disappointed.  I purchased 1 square yeast, scrumptious, 1 square cinnamon, divine, and 1 square jelly filled and peanut butter iced:  Life. Changing.  These donuts are not just good, they're exceptional.  The 2 fellas working there this morning were also super friendly.  1 got my mix of donut goodness and the other grabbed my Jamaiican Me Crazy coffee, also really tasty, even for a non-coffee drinker.  In and out in just a few minutes and didn't break the bank...just my diet!Do what I did:  work out, give into your craving, love the gluttonous life you just lived.",2
4,"This is a decent antique mall. I like to browse this mall every now and then. I usually find something to buy almost every time I visit. I like that they've expanded their mall, it gives you more things to look at. They have a lot of interesting things here.",2
2,"Found this restaurant from the Axxess card deal. When we arrived, it was not very busy and the manager took our orders quickly. He got to cooking right away and made the food quickly. The food smelled good and the proportions were very good. However, those are the only pros to this place.The fried rice and chow mein were very MEH. I feel as though that should be the staple of any Chinese restaurant - the fried rice did not have much taste at all and the rice tasted a little bit stale. The chow mein just did not taste good at all - I can't quite tell you what was wrong with it but I just did not like it. The orange chicken we ordered was very flavorful (albeit strong MSG tasting) and the other entrees were flavorful as well. Problem was - I had to drink a gallon of water afterwards to rehydrate myself. That evening, my stomach just hurt a little bit. So, was it the absolute worst food I've ever had? No. Would I necessarily go back again? Probably not.",0
5,"This was a good sit-down Asian restaurant. It wasn't the best Asian food I have had, but it was satisfying. The prices were not outrageous for the classiness of the space. The food came fast, and the waiter was friendly. Overall, we were very satisfied with the dinner.",2
4,"Went to try the Chocolate Chip Pancakes, and they did not disappoint.This place has figured out pancake batter. I have never had a pancake with better texture and flavor.Can't wait to return!!",2
3,"The Dosa is pretty decent but honestly the smoke really made my head hurt and made me cough. Made me feel pretty miserable and not hungry. Slow service, restaurant not clean.",1
5,I booked an appointment with Rebecca online -Not knowing what to expect when I arrived to this new salon. Everyone at Halo Hair was wonderful! The ladies who run the place are very warm. My haircut and color went great. Their prices are fair. Definitely coming back! Rebecca was very nice to talk to and work with.,2
5,"My wife and I went here for our anniversary and had such a great experience from the moment we arrived.  We were seated next to the huge fish tank, which is like getting a front row seat at a concert. For an appetizer, we started with the seared scallops, which were delicious. For dinner, my wife ordered the mahi and I had the grouper piccata. Both were great.  After dinner, we almost made a big mistake because we weren't sure if we were going to have dessert. Thankfully, our server, Jen Fig, told us that there was a new pastry chef who makes all the desserts in-house. Jen raved about the chef's newest creation, a lemon meringue cheesecake which I don't even think is on the menu yet. We had to try it and it seriously turned out to be one of the best desserts I've ever had. It was such a great way to end our evening. Thank you Jen!  I look forward to returning soon.",2
5,I took my wedding dress to Suki's and left a very happy customer. Suki is a sweetheart and made my dress look better than I dreamed it could look. Thanks Suki!!,2
5,The piano players here are awesome. We loved them. They can play anything! The drinks are fairly priced and the $5 cover was totally worth it.,2
5,"The hotel is in a great location in the city, easy walk to Broadway and First Street. The hotel staff at the front desk are very personable and helpful, especially the night time crew! There is often live music and a pool and bar on the 5th floor. Gym has great equipment to get a workout in. I would stay here again.",2
5,In a week of beer and wine tasting in Southern California this place had the standout beer!  Their XII quad was to die for.  I'm usually an IPA man where my wife usually goes for porters and stouts and this one hit the spot with both of us.  Nice bar area and friendly staff close to other wine and beer tasting rooms in the Funk Zone - definitely worth going the extra couple of blocks for it.,2
5,Great service and food!! The portion sizes were perfect!  Will definitely be back,2
5,They moved to 1515 DeKalb. The office is GORGEOUS! They have heated massage dental chairs and tvs on the ceiling. Love it! Staff is awesome!,2
2,"This place has just gone down hill. It used to be that the Rivergate Ocharley's was the worst, now I feel like this one is on the same playing field. We have eaten at this one many times in hopes that ""maybe it was just a bad night"". Unfortunately, this seems to not be the case. Last night was the last time we will be customers at this location.",0
5,"Affordable, amazing service, and a great location. I loved grabbing dinner here with my husband for a quick date out. I would have tried everything on the menu if I could have, but make sure you at least try the baklava. :) will definitely be coming back.",2
5,Absolutely fantastic service! I made a last minute appointment for a mani pedi and was taken care of with such ease. My nails look perfect and an extremely relaxing experience overall. Everybody there is very sweet and accommodating :),2
5,"Quick service, good coffee! They actually have coffee/lates on tap (like in a keg on nitro), and let me try a sample.  Delicious.  Atmosphere is great.  All in all a very cool coffee place!",2
1,"Ok I checked lots of reviews on this place , as there was lots of high ratings, and decided to make my way there which is about 30 minutes. I got there, and was disgusted by the appearance of the exterior, then worse interior. I asked to see menu and then walked out. I didn't even want to think what their kitchen looked like in the back.  Shame on Edmonton if they can rate this place a five star. You definitely pay for wht u get",0
4,"I like this place.  Unique sandwiches, and it's definitely the best place to go if you want a healthy option or have vegan friends.",2
4,"I liked this restaurant because it seemed to be quintessential New Orleans. Great location overlooking city park and beautiful cypress trees. Second floor has large shutter doors opening out to a deck with great park views. Great selection of house cocktails. Salad and entree were good but not particularly memorable; the lemon posset was a bit of a miss in my opinion.Overall, if in New Orleans, I would say give it a try. The atmosphere alone is worth a visit.",2
3,"The Pho Ga here is excellent best I've had outside of Vietnam.  The service is not so great.  All the food (appetizers, entrees, etc) came to the table at the same time with the exception of one of our companion's entree (he had to wait quite a while) .  The waitress apologized, but it was still a bit frustrating.  Communication with staff can be an issue as most are non-native english speakers so we had to work a little at getting the everything sorted out.  Despite the problems, I will definitely return.  If you don't have patience, don't go.  If you do, you will enjoy a great vietnamese meal.",1
3,"Yeah, good lobster but couldn't help walking away thinking I got ripped off.",1
4,"I loved this hotel! It was a little more than I wanted to spend, but so worth it. Convenient location, bar right down stairs, and I split the cost with some friends.  The rooms were awesome! Wifi wasn't free which I think is ridiculous for how much I paid and being 2014!! Valet parking is available too",2
4,Love this place!!!! Except the last time I went the guy said he could make a lavender tea iced!??? Not sure why it couldn't be poured over ice. It had been before. But I still love this place and the vibes.,2
1,"One of those places when you leave you ask yourself what just happened? The food (pasta) was the smallest portion of food I've ever been served (served in what looked like a small cereal bowl) anywhere for a whopping $16 and it was terrible. The beer was high gravity bottled beer for $6.50 per 12 ounce bottle and the cheapest small glass of wine was over $9.00. My wife and I had the pasta and 1 beer each and got out for $60.00 somehow. I'm not sure why we as customers give in to actually paying for small/bad food but what can you do when you're with a group of people? I will never go back there, I'll stick to the more reasonable 12 South Taproom which is about 90 feet away on the same side of the road for much cheaper prices and the food is so much better.",0
3,"Considering the outstanding reviews of Modesto, my experience was kind of a let down.We were seated promptly for our 8 o'clock reservation and our server was very nice and helpful in recommending an appropriate number of dishes.  We tried a red and a white sangria, I preferred the flavor of the white, however, there were only chunks of fruit in the red!  BOOO!  We had a hangar steak that was very nice as well as an extremely enjoyable paella.  We got some mussels, green beans, and bacon wrapped dates that were just ok.Perhaps it was due to faulty choosing, but my dinner at Modesto was lackluster.",1
3,Last couple of visits food has been average at best. Food served on bare metal tray and luke warm. Mac and cheese tasty but cold. Sweet tea so sweet it leaves an after taste in your mouth. Pretty bummed as this was one of my favorite bbq places when visiting last school year.,1
5,This is by far the best pizza in the area.  Brick oven and very tasty.  We love getting the special sodas there as a extra treat.  Tony is so friendly.  We usually get take out or delivery.  I love this place!,2
5,"Always a morning person, and not a fan of Starbucks breakfast,  and you are walking at 8 am on Broadway St. with everything closed,  it was to my happy surprise, a 24 hour diner!  This is no Waffle House, this is worthy of being in the mix of Nashville's restaurants.  Bacon is premier, eggs are worthy of small farm quality, and the toast...THE TOAST!  actually got a second order because of how good they were.   The potatoes that came with had some sweet potatoes mixed in to just make you smile. You can't miss the restaurant with the big picture window of the SUN flashing neon sign, right next to the Johnny Cash museum.  Limited menu, but what they do,  they do excellent.  Watched the million dollar come out,  and the other items,  and I would not have picked wrong on any item. Yes,  a little higher priced,  but it was excellent,  and I am full!",2
5,"I highly recommend coming here. If you do, ask for Kevin and Rich. Fantastic professional servers. They make you feel at home here. The food was unbelievable too. It was an overall great atmosphere and our waiters were wonderful. If you are in New Orleans, you must come here !",2
1,"I would do 0 stars if I could! This company took full payment for a bed and never delivered it. I sent 3 emails and many phone calls and not once did I receive a reply or call back nor did I ever receive an update on my purchase. The few times when someone answered when I called I was told it was on back order and then the day it was suppose to be delivered and wasn't, I called and was told it was discontinued. My money should have been refunded that day and in my account three days later( I was assured it was being refunded that day). It never got to my account and two phone calls later found out they never refunded it but was once again assured that they would refund it that day. I am now afraid I am going to have to take legal action to get my money back. I complained to managers and write emails but it does not seem to matter. Worst company and service ever!!!",0
1,"The quality of furniture here is absolutely horrible.  I bought a couch, loveseat, and recliner and paid a lot for them they were what they call bonded leather after only a couple of years all the surface had peeled off of all three pieces.  I also bought their joke of a warranty that considers this normal wear.  What a joke! Ashley Furniture is a rip off!",0
5,Best Chinese/Taiwanese  food in Reno! My daughter wolfed down the braised beef noodle soup in minutes. I did not even have a chance to try it. My other kid cleaned out the fried rice too.  I ordered the chicken bento box. It was delicious. We all shared the tasty and crunchy popcorn chicken. We had no left-over. Definitely will return for more tasty food.,2
1,"If you're white and dance to EDM don't bother coming here.   The tall (6'6""+) african-american bouncer kicked me out when I came out of the bathroom, after I had been there for only 2 songs, saying ""I need to talk to you outside"" then proceed to say ""girls are complaining you're dancing up on them"" I have a strict policy of NOT dancing up on girls or even initiating eye contact! (I have a firm opinion that most[not all] girls in clubs are attention whores, gold diggers and snobs - as such I do not go there for them! I go to have a good time enjoying the music). Obviously this accusation was complete BS. I can only assume the bouncers hater homies were not happy at all on the crowd of girls who circled up around me when I started getting down. I asked to speak to the manager who tried to pass off some BS excuses for his employees misbehavior and invited me back in, but my cab had already arrived to take me away from this POS, likewise I refused to come back into the club. The manager proceeded to tell me ""I don't care about Yelp or TripAdvisor reviews"" when I informed him I write online reviews  ... LOL! OK .. so what I have to say back here on the internet is: good luck bud. I won't be back & have a lovely career seeing as you don't understand the power of the internet! We yelpers stick together.  Piece of advice guy: don't let your employees play favorites with your patrons, I hope your club works out for the best... bon voyage!  I will spend my $$$,$$$.$$ (hint, hint) elsewhere like at the Push Ultra Lounge where I wont get discriminated against for being male, tall, white and cheered on by attractive females.  Sorry your bouncers homies cant dance to EDM (maybe they should go hang out at The Kennedy in Tampa - hehehe) & have a nice life!",0
3,"The food here is pretty good although it's a little pricey for what you get. You can get away with a few cheaper options, but for the most part it's around $20-$30 a plate. We're visiting Treasure Island (this is our third time in four years) for the week and we plan to come back sometime in the near future. However, I don't think this will be one of our ""musts"" to come back to next time.",1
4,"So many options I don't know what to choose!I definitely thought my friends and I were the oldest people in the joint, you know following the school of 3 year old birthday parties ordering before us. The line went quickly and was worth it.A small scoop will run you about $3 and they give you plenty! I ordered the  Black and Yellow Crunch which has chicory (that thing in Cafe du Monde coffee) which was awesome. It was really hard to not go with my gut and get a standard flavor, but I'm pleased I did.The red velet was outstanding and I tasted the oatmeal chip cookie which was good for a bite, would probably be too much in a cone.They have an array of Double Chocolate sweets all the way on the far left, but those are too chocolatey for me so I stayed away.I wish this place had more outdoor seating.",2
3,Super cute place! Came during lunch and I had the fig salad and it was really good although I'd probably ask for the dressing on the side next time since it was a bit much for me. Would definitely go again for another day date!,1
3,"Sister restaurant to Cantina Feliz, same menu.  Service was average but very pleasant.  The environment was lacking.  Music bounced between rock and Mexican themes which was odd.  But the food was solid.",1
5,"I had a problem with my car and pulled in without an appointment. The friendly service techs jumped right on it and got me back on the road quickly. Their professionalism, honesty, and attention to detail was highly appreciated! I can't say enough good things about this shop!",2
4,Fresh food and creative dishes. The service was good and the seating was comfortable. The orange juice is awesome. I was very pleased with the made to order hash.,2
5,"I came to Dayley dental on recommendation from a friend. I went in for a checkup and found that I needed some cavities filled. I had put off going to the dentist for a while because I have had bad experiences in the past. I needed them done the same day for insurance purposes. Dr. Dayley and his staff was awesome. They stayed after to get me finished up and were so nice about everything. Dr. Dayley is so nice and friendly. He made the whole experience of getting dental work so much less uncomfortable just by chatting with me throughout. He recommended some things that I could benefit from but didn't push anything. I am so glad I went here and I will definitely be back and will recommend them forever. Wonderful office, hygentists, assistants, and doctor.",2
4,"Food was good, Shannon our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable. We went with her recommendations and weren't disappointed. Good value. I would go back again.",2
2,"Everything here is sticky. Sticky floor, sticky table, sticky soy sauce bottles, sticky receipt book...  I got the sushi lunch special. The salad was pretty good, but the miso soup was super super salty. The sushi (crunchy shrimp roll) was good, but next time I'll go to Koi which is close, clean, and has much better food.",0
1,My first time coming here was super awesome. So I decide to bring my Mom for my second visit. Unfortunately I was so disappointed and mad that I took my mom here for lunch. We waited for about an hour for our food and they even manage to messed it up.Might come back for the drinks but not for the food.,0
1,"TERRIBLE FOOD TERRIBLE SERVICE! I never complain, but had to warn others...The place looked nice, till we got our waiter who was apparently an american coach from Brooklyn lol.... He repeatedly shoved at us the 2 most expensive meals on the menu even though we just wanted tacos. The tacos were the size of half dollars and bare. Highly disappointing and both my boyfriend and I were sick all night.",0
5,"The best Szechuan food I have had in center city~Their food is spicy, yet amazingly flavorful and the ambiance is sure to encourage a fun conversation with those you share your meal with (you'll definitely need a glass of water the first time you visit to handle the sexy heat). For what is expected of Chinese food, it is on the pricier side, but all well worth it.  My favorite recommendations include Dan Dan noodles, Dry Pepper Chicken/Shrimp, and Cumin Lamb.  The service can be slow during busier days such as Friday/Saturday/Sunday, but the waiters/waitresses are very friendly making the wait forgivable.",2
5,"the employees were all nice and respectful to their customers. I rented out a two-people kayak for $30, and we were allowed to ride it for 3 hours, which is a pretty decent deal. I paddled the kayak around the port. it's a great place to kayak because there are areas where the waves are calm, and if you want, you can go out into the ocean and ride along the shores. I also saw seals just relaxing on a deck, which was a cool experience (wished i brought my phone to take pictures). Overall, it was a fun activity to do, especially during a warm sunny day :D",2
5,"Had a business dinner here and was not disappointed. Prime location at the end of Rocky Point with amazing views of the bay from the dinner table. Atmosphere is dark and inviting and food was really great. Had the conch chowder and it was almost as good as the conch chowder I had recently in Nassau. Dinner was the pasta primavera with shrimp and get ready to eat for an army with the portion size. Nice selection of wine, I went with a really smooth glass of Sonoma Sauv Blanc. We did feel a bit underdressed in the environment but the bar with sports on television gave the white table clothes a nice relaxed balance. I will definitely eat here again and recommend to people I know.",2
3,"I actually eat here at least once a month . The food is good and the service compliments it. You will fall in love with there zucchini muffins. I always leave with some stashed in my purse, you know for later. The prices are cheap and they have a fantastic frozen yogurt bar . with unlimited toppings. Have fun !! yum yum",1
5,This place is so cool... I had the brisket and matzah ball ramen which had a flavorful broth and a little spice to it. Then I had the spiked juice of the day which was Asian pear and vodka... They pour healthy shots here so be prepared!,2
2,"I arrived at 9:40am for my 9:45 appointment. I left around 11:10. This was just a ""chat and get prescription renewal"" deal, no exam needed. After waiting almost an hour I'm called back and an older woman gets my weight and BP then starts asking questions (to fill in a computerized form) and giving me answers. Her name tag says ""Health Center Assistant II"". This means she is not a licensed provider and was out of her scope of practice to tell me what sorts of things were ""totally normal"" and ""nothing to worry about"". (I completed nursing school and one of the important parts of training is not to overstep and give patients advice you're not qualified to give. This woman was not a nurse nor a nurse practitioner.) She is also talking over me and cutting me off. At the conclusion of this little interview I'm told to go back to the waiting room and the NP will call me back shortly to see me. The nurse practitioner calls through the door, I walk into the hallway by the receptionist's desk, and she hands me 2 sheets of paper. ""Are these alright?"" I look. They're my prescriptions. I say, ""Yes."" She says, ""Then you're all set,"" and walks away. This was the extent of my ""appointment"" with the NP. She didn't even introduce herself, we never went into an exam room, there was no, ""Do you have any questions about all your lady parts that could get cancerous in your 30s?"" VERY unprofessional. I've gotten shitty service at PP offices before when it's lunch time, and I have a feeling that was the case here too. However, the office was clean and I liked the stained concrete floors and colors on the walls. 2 women were at the front desk and the non-African American one was helpful and nice to everyone I heard her speak to. (I didn't interact with the African American one and didn't hear her speak to anyone besides the other front desk person.) Adoption information is available here as well as free condoms. Sign in parking lot: Do Not Enter. Beware of Gator. Yep...this PP is on the banks of the river.",0
1,"Went here this Friday and had Rendang. Okay food (worth the price). Horrible service. Servers took turn to rush us by constantly asking if we were finished while we clearly were not. When we were done, we had separate checks. One friend tipped 10% for it and had a female server chased us down outside and COMMANDED (exact words: ""COME HERE!"" with a frown on her face) my friend to come back inside and QUESTIONED her with rudeness why she didn't tip 15%. My friend who used to work at a country club didn't even bother to explain to her what is actual serving. By this time, I was truly regretful for tipping at all. Don't get me wrong, the food is not bad, but not worth the service that we had. We would never visit this place again.",0
4,"I work on Vassar St. in Reno, which may qualify as a food desert. Fast good as far as the eye can see, very little freshness. Therefore, I can't say how grateful I am that a place like Cafe Deluxe is only 5 minutes away. The food here is fresh, locally sourced when possible, and reasonably priced. Delicious dishes, with or without meat (GREAT veggie and vegan options). They do to-go orders, also, which is helpful when I need to eat on the run. I appreciate their combination of easily portable foods like smoothies, sandos, and wraps with dining friendly options. I like good options whether I stay or go. Some dishes to try: Apple Cheddar melt (mustard on there is to die for), grilled hummus sando, flying squirrel. The only reason I'm withholding that 5th star is because of some service issues. I've had some long waits at that counter and there are times the tension amongst some servers is palpable. Other than that... I love this place.",2
4,"Since I am not a regular Vietnamese food eater, I am giving SF 4 stars, but in my book it is a 5 as I was ""Wow'd""!This place has been opened 5 months and it was well run; the front end and the dining room are decorated for a great ambience; food was great.  I ordered 3 dishes for my daughter and I, the recommended salt and pepper pork chop as well as the special of the day - tomato and bean curd hot pot (with beef) and the chicken pho.  The hot pot was great as served - I added no additional condiments-I love tomato and beef together, in any cuisine, and it really stayed tremendously hot - it was bubbling under the lid when served.  The salt and pepper pork chop was sliced into pieces, fried and served with dried red chilis, onion and garlic - smelled divine!  Great spicy taste-beware of bones :)  the plain chicken pho had a nice mild sweetness to the flavorful broth and was very satisfying.  (no condiments were served with it like lime wedges - not sure if we needed to ask or if it a regional thing?) The menu includes traditional Chinese food and lower luncheon pricing on a variety of dishes. SF Kitchen is close to the GSR, my home away from home; and an even shorter distance from Renown Hospital. #UNRmom #GSR",2
5,"Let me be frank and say I am a universal Schlafly fan. I like the Schlafly family, their products, each restaurant, and their presence in the St. Louis community. This review is based on several experiences. Bottleworks: Great beer and a nice atmosphere. You can bring your entire family, a group to watch the game or have a quiet date night spot. Food is of great quality and nice quantity. Waitstaff are some of the best in the City. I have never ever been disappointed with a server, manager, buser or host. One time a buser overheard my dad talking about a particular beer that was no longer on tap for the season. My dad was bummed because he had just discovered it and wasn't able to find it anymore. 15 minutes later the young man dropped off a mini-pint at our table and told us he had looked and found a tiny reserve in the back. Super impressive and wayyy beyond the call of duty.",2
4,"What's not to like about Mr. Wizard's?  It's definitely a different feel than the other ice cream places around, the crowd's a little more bizarre, and the location (Dogtown-ish) is significantly more convenient for me and my friends.I came here for the first time the other night and definitely expected not to be wowed, but dammit if it wasn't GOOD!  I ordered a specialty flavor-- ""The Wizard""-- which was chock full of brownies, nuts, I think, and strawberries.  The medium size was bigger than I expected, and it ran me about $5.00, so next time, I'll go for a smaller size.I like Mr. Wizard's, and I'll definitely be back.  I like the casual neighborhood feel, the thicker, different taste of the custard, and the fact that the location is right.Just one question: Who IS Mr. Wizard?",2
2,"Disappointing. After reading the reviews on Yelp I decided to go. Starting with the roti appetizer, there was literally one piece of potato and one piece of chicken that was mostly bone. The pad thai noodles were no longer than than half an inch long, and tasted like they were cooked in butter and not much else. The service was horrendous, period",0

5,"I've had a good experience with Fort Lowell Realty so far.  Kathy Flores has been responsive from the time she showed me the property we're currently renting to letting me know what I needed to do throughout the application and lease signing process.  When we relocated and picked up the keys to the house, there was a slight snafu with having the correct keys but Kathy responded immediately and helped us get in to the property right away (we were pretty road weary from driving 1600 miles so it was a relief that she was so quick to get back to us!)  The woman at the front desk (whose name I don't recall) was also super helpful and friendly.  Also love that there is a Tenant Portal that houses the lease agreement, lets us pay online and therefore we're assured that the payments have been received and everything is track-able.",2
1,"The worst!!! We waited in line for 2 hours while they let ppl cut in front of us...when we finally get in...order drinks and food it takes 23 min to get our food..nachos....all bottom of the barrel chips...server says NOTHING!!! ...and still no 2 beers and a marg....never come...I do this for a living...there is no excuse for food to beat drinks...if this is happening the MOD on duty is NOT doing their job helping and backing up the staff....drinks come..we order shots....wrong shots came out not what we ordered...then we get charged for 6 shots!!! Sorry wrong again.... Nothing to fix the problem...then give us the wrong bill!!! We pay bill because obviously we are not here for customer service...and it's a few dollars cheaper...don't think we would have gotten much better. Surprising how a establishment can treat their guests this way and expect them to come back....wait it's a tourist spot so why would they care. Seriously you couldn't last on your guest services...good thing your a ""TRAP"" makes me wonder if our ""stellar"" service is because of poor management and training. Good luck..hate to think a big corporate restaurant like you can take out honest wholesome business with good service and honest and integrity. Never again",0
5,"I'm very picky when it comes to Sushi. Quality of the fish and ingredients are very important but so is the chef, maybe the most important. Hiro San is absolutely amazing at what he does. His skills are hands down the best and he's also a really great human being to talk to. If you are in the Santa Barbara area looking for a great Sushi experience come here and sit in front of the master, you won't regret it.",2
5,"Great burgers,fries and salad!  Burgers have a hint of salt and pepper flavor.This location is very quaint. They only have outdoor seatingFriendly staff.Street parking as well as parking lot in the back.",2
5,"We've eaten at every sushi place in Reno, this is the best we've had.  The fish is really good, and the rolls are very creative.  The Nevada and Taimon rolls are insane.  They also have great ice cream and dessert sushi that is outstanding.No wait. No lines.",2
5,Excellent!! Great service great food! Every time we go they treat us like if we  were in Tokyo The Chef / owner takes pride in what he does. Love it!,2
5,"I had take out from here tonight so this review is solely the food. My first time here even though I live around the corner. I ordered the Buffalo chicken salad with romaine letteus and blue cheese dressing. It was amazing! Greens were fresh and crispy, blue cheese dressing not full of chunks, and chicken delicious. I will definitly be going back for this salad.",2
2,"I just expect more from a Wawa. It's not that it was bad, but the fact that I waited for almost 20 minutes for a latte is ridiculous, no matter how late at night it is.",0
5,"Amazing food, great atmosphere. Glad we now have a quick way to get our Indian cuisine! I will definitely be back and bringing friends and family!!",2
3,"Decent little dive on Metairie road. Often empty, but they seem like they're stepping up their game with some new promotions. Food is pretty good, especially compared to the equivalent dives in the area. All in all, a pretty decent place to step in for a quick drink, but I wouldn't pass a whole lot of time here.",1
4,The Peppermill has be getting better and better each time I have seen it. They are working hard on making the hotel competitive with other large hotel's in other major tourist areas. they offer many different restaurant selections and have a massive casino. For children they have an amazing arcade.,2
4,"Wow, 6 tastings of red wine for $20 dollars while enjoying the ocean on a secluded upper deck on the warf. Excellent wine and great friendly service. Found a zinfandel I loved and had a glass. Casual and friendly with ocean breeze,.",2
1,"Hubby and I were eager to try this establishment due to a rave review from some close friends. We decided for our date night we would give it a try on Saturday. We pulled up about 8pm and the open sign was turned off. We thought maybe the light was burnt out or someone just forgot to plug it in. So we proceeded to the door. There were people inside and the sign said open till 11pm, so we walked inside. It was like walking into the Twlight Zone, everyone stopped and stared at us. The woman behind the bar came over and told us they were closed. HUH! Ok.... so we left. It was very akward and unpleasant. If they were closed then the door should of been locked or a sign on the door stating private party or something. Not sure if we will attempt to try to dine there again.",0
3,"We wandered into Slate because the wait for brunch at Day by Day was longer than we were willing to wait. Unfortunately, getting seated immediately at Slate does not imply that you will get your food any faster. There were two other people in the restaurant when our party of six was seated but, despite the emptiness, our food somehow took 45 minutes to make. When we asked about the status of our meal we were told that they were doing their best but to keep in mind that ""we were a six-top without a reservation..."" Personally I think that having or not having a reservation seems rather irrelevant when your restaurant has plenty of open tables...In conclusion, I've experienced better and faster service. If you have the time, the brunch is good (I enjoyed the frittatas and home fries/chips - although that may have been my hunger talking).",1
5,"This is possibly my favorite sushi place in Philly. The ambiance isn't awesome, but the service is attentive, and the food is great. They have a bunch of interesting/creative rolls, and the fish is fresh and tasty. Plus the rolls are pretty large.",2
5,"I go once a month for a women's haircut with Keri and, because Andre Richard is in my neighborhood, I usually schedule my appointments for weekday evenings. There is a nice sense of community at this salon. The atmosphere is always fun and inviting, with coffee or tea at the ready and many of the stylists singing along to the latest pop songs on the stereo. The salon is queer-friendly, and Keri does a wonderful job giving volume and style to short, thin hair. She is especially generous with tips on how to style my hair at home, offering blow-drying techniques and suggestions of inexpensive styling products available at CVS or Walgreens. My girlfriend received a great haircut there as well, and she has long, thick hair that falls in loose curls. I always feel welcome at Andre Richard and I leave feeling like my hair has been treated with care and attention. Plus, the salon sometimes offers specials on certain nights of the week (Thursday appointments are currently 20% during the month of February!).",2
4,"Helpful local hardware store. Part of the Ace system. Not having to deal with a mega-store and being able to get personal service are the big perks. They've been very helpful to me even though my projects have entailed inexpensive purchases that involved finding the right screw, bolt and nut.",2
5,"C&P has quickly become a neighborhood favorite dishing out some of the most vibrant and tasteful liquid delights made in our fair city. Between each visit I have made to C&P, I feel like they have evolved in their drink and menu choice. C&P should be a definite stop for any beer nerd looking for a quality brew.",2
5,"If I'm basing my rating on the taste and quality of the food, then I must give it a five star rating! I did not mind the atmosphere, which admittedly leaves a bit to be desired. I was too busy eating our delicious dinners. My companion had Chicken Tikka and I had Malai Kofta. Definitely loved both of them and their prices were exactly what I would expect to pay. We are already planning our return trip.",2
5,Awesome place for the guys to get a haircut.  All the barbers were friendly and eager very eager to cut the next customers hair. Highly recommend going here.,2
3,"Friendly people,  quick service.  Place ok,  Food (spaghetti) was underwhelming,  not worth the price... Located in a new area that has a nice future.",1
4,"Great beers and cool atmosphere. They recently finished their outdoor patio and it looks spectacular. You can sit outside in any weather and stay warm. Their food is also really good; I recommend the beer bread with the oatmeal stout beer. They make a tasty sloppy joe sandwich, a huge BLT, and a good blackened catfish. Their beer tour is more informative than the Anheuser Busch beer tour although it is not quite as long. The only negative is that the food isn't cheap, but it is made with local sources and is definitely worth the price. This is one of the spots where we bring out-of-town friends. They always like it! Bottleworks earns an A.",2
5,"Very good for breakfast. The portions are huge. Our server Frank was very attentive and made sure everything was great. The manager Tim came over and we ask if we needed something cooked special for allergy reasons and he said yes they can accommodate for that, just let the server know when ordering. Coffee is very good and my wife had the tea and it was also good.",2
5,This was the first time we've been to this location and it is pretty cool. They have plenty of area to sit and relax and of course the coffee and food selection is on point.,2
2,My family was drawn into Rotten Ralph's by their good Happy Hour prices. We got appetizers and the food was fine - not great but typical. The issue came when we got our bill. The prices were all messed up and apparently our waitress had given us the wrong food. Ultimately though it was resolved.,0
4,"The most pricey market around but for a reason, they carry a wide range of EVERYTHING! Great store brand products and something for every eating style. Whole Foods also gives local brands a chance to feature in store, has hot food w/ good flavor profiles, a cheeses section as big as a walk in closet and on certain days give a ways! The store is clean and sports a friendly knowledgeable staff that RARELY lets the lines get too long. You can grab organic anything and also something for your skin while you're here, they really do sell everything. You may spend your weight in gold before you leave but you'll be satisfied!",2
5,"Cute, lovely place in a hidden location! The service was great and the owners were lovely. Had the chicken and waffles and it was AMAZING!! 10/10 would eat here when I'm in town again!",2
2,Sushi is not fresh and dining area is not clean. Will NOT be going back. Ever. Only came because I acquired a free Groupon. Fish is chewy. Rule of thumb never go to a sushi place that has to emphasize their coupons to make up for their lack of freshness,0
5,"the store is adorable! I was extremely impressed with the fantastic customer service I received from the very nice woman working there today. she immediately offered samples of the chicken salad and cinnamon rolls which were out of this world! I was only passing by but before I knew it I bought pies (yes in plural form) chicken salad, and their fresh white bread. 5 stars!",2
5,"Tasting for our wedding cakes. Tasted 3 gluten free flavors - chocolate, vanilla, pina colada. And 5 regular flavors. Was a nice tasting experience. I'll post another review after we have the wedding and get the cake.",2
5,"Just discovered this place and I already love it more than any other Thai place i've tried in SB! Amazing customer service and the food is even better. The management is absolutely wonderful, they saw me waiting for my food to come out and brought me a complimentary thai tea. Try them out for lunch as they have great deals and it's right in the middle of State so you can do a little shopping while you wait (or call ahead if you're in a rush). Took about 10 minutes for fresh pad thai",2
4,"Both the sweet and savory crepes here are DELICIOUS! So many choices and hard to pick which one is best. The teas they have are also wonderful. This is a quiet, quaint little place with the sweetest wait staff. I've been going here for years and would recommend to everyone wanting to have a casual meal in an unpretentious setting.",2
5,Great selection of yogurts and toppings.  Great place to bring children they have lots of tables to sit and enjoy your dessert.,2
3,Can't say I would rush back as the ambiance wasn't exactly four star or higher. I'm not saying if I'm in the area and craving some sushi I wouldn't stop again. So prepare yourself for a slightly beaten up space but with pleasant help and ok food.,1
3,"If you like a quiet  shopping experience without the crowds, this mall is the place for you.",1
4,"Girlfriend (cpa) got their ""cpa"" and liked it. Me bring a huge GOT fan got the ""white walker"" both were good as were the pizzas!",2
5,"Jessica C. was Super Helpful, it's a Huge & Busy Store, i can't even tell how much she helped this newbieon the South East corner across from the Speedwasy Shopping Mall, across the street from Marsh & also directly across from KFC",2
5,"I was a little worried about seeing the reviews but everything. Was great! Not long wait time. Staff was nice from walking in the lobby and asking which way to the office, to the office staff.",2
4,"Had lunch here today. My cheeseburger was a 10/10 with an avocado on top. I also had the ""ranchero fries"" which are French fries with ranch, cheese, and tomatoes on top! The only thing keeping this awesome lunch spot from being 5 star would be the fact that it took a significant amount of time to get out food when the restaurant was relatively pretty slow.",2
5,"Great food, drinks, and service!!! Thank you to our server Madison! We had an awesome experience!",2
5,"Ichicoro Ane gets lots of things right and the best part about it is the combination of the ambiance with the food choices and whiskey selection. I'm very happy with this location and the servers I have encountered so far have been helpful and pleasant.The katsu is great and I highly recommend it to people looking for a more filling dish on the menu. The bao buns were also good for a lighter fish. I haven't had anything I really regretted trying, but definitely ask your server about the portion sizes of each dish since they vary across the menu.The cocktail selection is excellent. I even had a special Japanese Old Fashioned last time which was a little expensive, but well worth it for some quality Japanese whiskey. I'm looking forward to exploring the menu little by little. The best way to experience this is in a group setting so you can try more things and it really reminds me of Izakayas or Japanese pubs I visited in Japan and Korea.",2
3,"I came in here the other night for a  post-show snack after seeing a ESO performance at the Winspear. The main reason we chose this location was because it was close to the Winspear, and open late (until 11:30pm on Friday and Saturday). I don't have any strong criticisms of the restaurant. I suppose, if anything, the menu may have seemed a little bit over-priced - at least for what I ordered. I had a Caesar salad with three 'jumbo' shrimp on it, which cost $15. The portion size did not seem to justify the cost and the jumbo shrimp were fairly average in their size, but the flavours were good and the ingredients were fresh. My friend had a soup, which looked and smelled absolutely amazing, and at $6 it didn't seem too unreasonable. She also had the smoked salmon Carpaccio, which looked very appetizing with its thick slices of dark rye bread and generous slices of smoked salmon and capers. The also had a couple of interesting beers on their menu that we were keen to try.I think if you're going to a show in the area and looking for a spot to get a drink or a snack afterward, this is not a bad option. Their menu at that time of night had an interesting mix of appetizers and desserts that seemed to provide something to suit most tastes.I'm assuming Normand's Bistro must be connected to the Normand's restaurant which is on Jasper Avenue. Of interest, I have heard that Normand's took over the brunch menu that had formerly been offered at the Glenora Bistro.",1
5,"Gelato is always a favorite on a hot Tucson Day, and Frost is the place to get it.  When you walk inside, their counter is a showcase of delightful flavors, and you can have as many tastes as you want before deciding what to purchase.  They also serve shakes, root beer floats, and other confections, none of which I have tried.  The only downside to this location is that there are only two or three small tables inside.  Being that this is a popular spot in the summer, the tables fill up quickly and you are relagated to sitting outside at tables that are shaded, but still in the heat. Even so, it is worth a trip when you are in the mood for a yummy treat.This is a family owned business that is just starting to offer franchises and expand into other locations.",2
5,We have been ordering from them for about a year. Their prices are decent and the food has usually always been great. My wife loves the poppers and we both love the chicken tenders.The owner seems like he really cares about the customers. We had a few mistakes in our orders over the years and the owner is very apologetic and fixes the problem right away.,2
3,"health food overload. this place looks and smells like the prototypical health food store, which i do not dig. (call me what you will, but i like my health food disguised in pretty environs like whole foods. if i'm going to pay top dollar, i don't want to feel like i've walked into a feed store.)there are lots of products for lots of special needs; however, i found that some things were more expensive than the nearby whole foods so unless i absolutely need something that only essene has, i'll likely not return.",1
1,"The owner of this restaurant-- Aaron Teitelbaum-- essentially accused me of lying about whether a zuchinni-potato pancake had been included with my entree. It had not and I had no reason to lie about it. The four of us spent well over $300-- are you serious? Food was OK otherwise, but the owner embarrassed me and almost spoiled the night.",0
1,I had a scheduled appointment no one came to greet me as I pulled up which was fine as I was. 15 minutes early.  I waited a total of 50 minutes still not one service representative met with me.  I had made this appointment a week and half prior.  A service tech came by and asked that I move my car to make room for others this is waiting 1 hour 37 minutes to get waited on .  I said sure and just left as he had no idea when someone would meet with me.  The last thing I get is a voicemail saying I missed my appointment if I wanted to reschedule.  No wonder this dealership has so low ratings.  I will call Honda customer service and voice my concerns next week.,0
4,"The food was excellent.  The service was ok.  The fried oyster salad was very good.  The seafood gumbo is silky smooth.  The atmosphere is a bit noisy, in the front dining room.  The bar looked very old and cool.",2
5,"I popped in for a quick lunch with my 5 year old, and we knew we were onto something good the moment we walked in and the delicious smell hit our noses. The person that took our order was helpful, friendly, and eager to help us figure out what we'd like best. We chose our seat among the clean, well laid out space. The food showed up after not too long. We had an order of the wings and loved them. The seasoning was perfect and they were exceptionally moist. I ordered the chili which came with *the best corn bread I've ever had*. We got an order of the ribs to go which the rest of the family devoured. They are fall off the bone moist and again seasoned perfectly. The BBQ sauce options were all memorable. I look forward to being back with the whole crew!",2
5,"Beautiful night with my kids! Shopping amongst all of the local artisans of Indy. What a great night to shop for jewelry, pottery, coffee, clothing, food,etc. Great vendors! We had a blast and will be back to shop for Christmas 2017!",2
4,"I've been here twice and referred two people and so far, everyone has been very pleased.  Amanda is great. She listens carefully and then offered some great suggestions for my weird and hard to manage hair.  I was very happy with my first cut, and the second, which was far less dramatic. She recently chopped about 12 inches from a friend's hair and it looks AMAZING! I may go get the same cut for myself.I even talked my husband in to coming here and he, too, was pleased.The prices are very reasonable and the service was exceptional. I felt like I had been going there all my life. Its not frilly and stuffy like the center city salons and there isn't any pressure.Definitely worth checking out!",2
1,"The atmosphere was good, however I didn't like the music. So loud.If you are looking for Japanese Ramen noodle, Don't ever order. It's taste horrible. If you cook instant ramen is better. I was waiting for my check for10min? Our server didn't come to our table.I won't go there again.",0
4,Loved the Mediterranean Grilled Cheese sandwich! Nice casual atmosphere. On the end of the strip so it is very convenient to get to during lunch hour. Looking forward to trying something else on the menu.,2
4,"St. Cecilia is a lovely, intimate space with excellent food and great service.  They also make a good Sazerac, which I've learned is mandatory to be considered fine dining in NOLA.  Our party of two had two  appetizers, grilled oysters and confit wings.  Both were great.  For our entree, we split the gnocchi, which was about as good as gnocchi gets, and the reason you should visit St. Cecilia.We drank our dessert - Sazerac, again, and went on our merry way, feeling pleasantly mellow and satisfied.",2
5,third window brewing company wow really tasty beers they got 6 beers on tab and all of the beers i try was tasty and flavorful with a kick i like all 6 beers that they have and the service was really nice cool chill vibe they also have food and a nice patio check them out third window brewing good beers and chill spot yelp on yelpers,2
4,"This is just a great hardware store. They carry most everything and I have never struggled to find whatever it is that I am looking for. The only downsides are the price (a little steeper than your warehouse hardware store - but still reasonable) and that they close at 3pm on the weekend. I know that everything in Philadelphia shuts down on Sunday so I should be thankful for the 3pm close. However, Sunday is kind of a big day for dealing with household things so a 5pm close would be greatly appreciated. Also, the owner (the ""perfect man"" as he is referred to among the women I know) has a pretty kickass and chill massive dog. Although he (the dog) has off one day during the week, I think Wednesdays. So be sure to visit when everyone is accounted for!",2
4,"Finding a good barbershop is just as hard as finding a good church.  You want to go to a place where you are comfortable, have some good fellowship, and ultimately you want to leave changed.  Fortunately, I happened upon this place while visiting Jersey.  Dre was able to get me in and out with no hassle.  I paid my tithes and left feeling renewed.",2
5,"I expected to be bored. In fact me and the bf said good thing it's free or else we wouldn't go and probably will only stay an hour or so. But no, it was entertaining. A museum that is not boring! I liked the way it's set up for you to wander around. And ok the religious stuff was pretty boring but other than that it was good. Modern art was of course the most entertaining (and sometimes stupid, easy to see why it gets made fun of with some of the installations...just lol) There were so many things. The lights on the sides of the escalators, big entire wall murals. This room that you look in and it's all dark and foggy and there is a big grey square on the wall. You walk closer and then when you are right in front of it realize it's nothing, a cut out of the wall. That was probably a bad description. Go see for yourself then and write me a new one. And it was freezing out so I didn't even see any of the gardens which I've heard are marvelous.",2
5,"Very affordable clothing and they're ALWAYS running sales. Very affordable, yet trendy, and has excellent customer service. The other stores in the same area are very pricey, so if you're are looking to ""dress up"" ;) on a budget, this is the place for you.",2
4,"Tria opened this past weekend, and my buddy and I decided to give it a try.  We arrived around 7 pm on Wednesday and were seated immediately at a unique table with a coffee table for food.  it was noted that it was just a seating area, but we didn't care eating off of a coffee table and took the spot.Their drink menu was on an ipad mini, which was pretty sleek. They showed you descriptions of the beer as well as how much of the keg was left. Apparently if your drink kicks the keg (i.e. empties it) you get that portion of beer for free. So there could be some gamesmanship if you like as well.They had a ton of beers and one of the ones i tried Freigeist Abraxxxas was REALLY good, complex, and generally didn't taste like beer. quite good.  My friend recommended it and the waitress was impressed with my choice, so yeah, good call buddy.We had the wings and mussels to start, wings were really good with the citrus kick and cilantro.  Unfortunately, the mussels were really salty.  likely due to reduction of the broth? or perhaps just tht was supposed to be the way it was supposed to be to pair with beer, but really, WAY too salty.The flatbreads were pretty good. the duck flatbread was ok, but i really liked the philly roast pork one.  Overall, a great experience!",2
2,"We don't get out too much anymore so we were so excited to try Charro Steak & wanted to love it so bad. But the experience was just not a good one. We made reservations and upon arrival they sat us at a table near the very back, right by the chef's work table. My husband wanted to sample a beer before ordering drinks and it came warm, at which time he was informed that all the beers would be warm because they were having some kind of issue with the tap system. No big deal but also not ideal. So I ordered the pinot noir on tap and it came chilled?! Which again was fine but weird since the beer was warm.Service wasn't great. The ambiance wasn't ideal. The chef cut the steak right behind us which was loud and they also had a staff meeting right next to us which was just odd and awkward. The filet was really good but otherwise the food was only OK. Overall it wasn't a BAD experience but it just wasn't good either. I wouldn't recommend it because there are just too many better places to go!",0
5,I finally found Daisy after a series of bad hair cuts. She immediately diagnosed the problem and we talked about what styles work and don't work for my hair and face. Then she transformed my dysfunctional cut into an adorable low maintenance bob and I've never been happier. She is absolutely the best and I can't recommend her enough!,2
4,Been here time and time again. I have an obsession with there potstickers by far still the best in Reno. Check it out.,2
4,"Reading prior reviews, I wasn't sure what to expect.  We went for lunch on a Friday and we're seated immediately.   Our server was very attentive.  The children loved the view of the boats in the marina and their frozen mango drink.  The blackened grouper was cooked perfectly as was the grilled crab cake.   We had the Cleveland oyster appetizer.  The oysters were from the Texas Gulf and were a good size.",2
5,Love this place - their burritos and fruit tea are a once a week appointment!,2
1,"This hotel was so terrible and I can narrow it down to 4 things:1. The price: Expect to pay a lot of money from the second you arrive. They charge $35 per person for a round trip shuttle ride to the airport. Our room was roughly $275 a night. It's an incredibly large hotel that offers a nail salon, a Godiva Chocolate store, about 9 restaurants and a few bars. But you'll pay dearly for any of those things - like $2.50 for a small bottle of soda. The hotel is designed to keep you in there and they charge you $15 for a round trip shuttle ride to the downtown Nashville area. 2. The service: We called the front desk and were on hold for 20 minutes. We went to the front desk and waited in line for an hour. We waited around to ask the concierge questions. And each time we got, ""I don't know"" as the usual response. The cleaning staff was extraordinarily loud and they actually shouted as they went down the hall at 6:30 a.m.3. The name: They call this place a resort but that is, by far, a misnomer. This place is a convention hotel, period. It's horrifically loud at all hours of the day because they host about 3 conventions at one time. Our windows faced one of the courtyards and there is music pumping there 24 hours a day. The walls are thin and you can hear *everything* happening in the neighboring rooms. (eww!) If you want to relax at a resort, don't stay here because with all those convention people, loud cleaning staff, 24 hour music and thin walls you will only end up with more stress.4. The size: It's no joke that you will get lost in this hotel. It's inexplicably large. And when it hits noon, you should already be in one of the few restaurants because they fill up FAST. With several conventions happening at one time, getting a ""quick bite"" is not possible here. And there's not really any place close by, either. You can walk over to the mall for some fast food but plan enough time for your walk - getting out of the hotel takes at least 5 minutes.I'm sure glad I was there for a convention and didn't pay out of my own pocket for this ridiculous hotel.",0
5,"Best hotel/casino in Reno. The rooms are really nice, whether in the Peppermill tower or the Tuscany tower. The Tuscany side is REALLY nice, Big, nicely decorated rooms and  huge bathrooms with TVs and showers big enough for two. All of the Peppermill restaurants are above average with Biscotti's being my favorite. Even their room service delivers great food in a very timely manner even when they're busy. The rooms and the casino are very clean. The best part is their employees. They're ALWAYS very accommodating, helpful, and seem to really care about the guests. Everyone from the valets to the bell desk to the reservations desk and people working in the casino seem very willing to help with whatever is needed. I've stayed in other Reno hotels and none can even come close to the overall quality of the Peppermill.  I never win on the slots but I always have a lot of fun!",2
5,This is by far the best place in town to get a burger and enjoy a great atmosphere! My husband and I come here at least 4 times a month! The quinoa fritters are our fav and the happy hour is awesome! Totally worth it!,2
5,"New Day has definitely become my go-to location for my growlers. My running favorites are definitely Johnny Chapman and South Cider. Parking can be a little bit of a headache on the weekend and Fridays, but it's that way with anything in Fountain Square. Make sure to go on Tuesdays for half priced growler refills!",2
1,"Terrible selection, even worse quality. Big mistake. Skip this place. Not worth the price!",0
3,Came here whilst waiting for the megabus to DC. It is a dim quiet bar with a small crowd of regulars and travelers. I had the buffalo chicken wrap and fries for dinner. The fries were Luke warm and the buffalo chicken wrap was spicer than expected. A decent meal if you are hungry.,1
4,"10 bucks per person to play as long as they are open no coins or tokens required. Several arcade games, most of the different gaming consoles, and board games for people to play. I took my boys here for a couple hours and they had a great time ... I was a little disappointed that there was only one pinball machine and it didn't work. They have some video games for sale and they also sell beverages. Not a bad or expensive place to take the kids... would be awesome if the had one of these in Greenwood..,",2
4,"Don't be fooled by BRIO being a ""chain"" restaurant. The food is freshly prepared by Chef Jay Witte and the selections are pretty extensive. I like the bar area and the heated patio and it is definitely a great place to people watch. The happy hour from 3:30-6:30 and 9pm to close features $2.95 appetizers. And its not skimpy apps. It is the full serving size. Brushettas to the Brio Burger, you can't go wrong with the appetizer menu. Drinks are comparably priced to other restaurants in the Frontenac area. Delcious food, great atmosphere means I will be back again.",2
4,"Very cool spot with nice people, good drinks, great music. 4 stars instead of 5 because a VERY popular restaurant that is located in a place that has rain almost daily and has mostly outdoor seating has failed to realize umbrellas at tables are a thing.",2
5,"Plaza deli is awesome.  Great portions, reasonably priced, friendly staff.  Cash only though, so plan ahead.",2
5,"We are from out of state and came here for breakfast. Loved the location, was super cute and quiet. We had our breakfast outside near the train tracks. The waiter was so nice! We had our first beignets and OMG I'm hooked! I'm a little bummed that i won't have anymore when I return back to Oregon. All the food we ordered was simply amazing!",2
4,New owners turned it into a double threat: Bad food AND bad service. Shame. I loved this place.,2
2,Cocktails were nice however the bartender Paul was perhaps the least friendly person I've met. Certainly wasn't a bartender that wants to keep patrons drinking for an extended period.,0
4,like other high end steak house chains is a very good meal..and it should be cause its not exactly a cheap meal. I prefer morton's over the others b/c I just have better cuts of meat in my opinion. i recommend the filet and porterhouse. the crab cake is pretty good and the prime ocean platter has always been very fresh and tasty. they run a promotion where u get dinner for 2 for 100 a few times a year definately take them up on that offer.,2
5,"On the banks of the river ... is the best pizza I have ever eaten, period.  Its as much about the crust as it is about the balanced accompaniments.  A thin but delicate crust with rewarding texture and flavor that offer meaningful contributions to the topping interplay (rather than delivering toppings in an after-thought, unremarkable, edible vessel).The perfect meal so far ...- VASI - Ceci Beans and Lentis (tomato scapece, grana padano)- ANTIPASTI - Aggrodolce Pork Ribs (green apple, pistachio)- LE PIZZE - Spicy Ham (coppa piccante, san marzano tomato)- DOLCI - Zeppole (blackberry yogurt, lemon curd)Honorable mentions and amazing seconds if you can manage ...- VASI - Cannelini Bean Aioli (smoked pepper, arugula, sicilian tuna)- ANTIPASTI - Carciofi Fritti (fried artichokes, lemon yogurt)- LE PIZZE - Quattro Formaggi (ricotta, scamorza, marinated tomato)- DOLCI - Cannoli (pistachio, lemon-ricotta, chocolate-olive oil).",2
5,This place is a true gem. I had a carrot and ginger soup with the turkey and cranberry sandwich. Both were delicious (my husband won't stop talking about it)! Plus we got to meet Sabrina herself who made us feel like old friends. Highly recommend.,2
1,"Why don't we have a Target?  I thought K-Mart was going out of business.  Well not this one, this miserable son of a bitch refuses to die.  They had the audacity to try to update it.  It reminds me of Jack Palance its old, tired, and smells funny, but it ain't going know where.    I wish a shiny new Target would come along and stab this relic of a store through the heart with its superior retail sword.  I have experienced on no less than 5 occasions of a product being labeled as on sale only to be charged full price at the counter.  Then I have to stop the line to back to the aisle and grab the sign to show it to the cashier.  Once I bought a beach chair here, well my wife saw the dopeness of said chair and wanted to copy me.  I return to the store the next day (happened to be 80 degrees and sunny) and those SOB's raised the price of the chair $10.  I was pissed yo.",0
5,"After a long afternoon of back to school shopping in the mall, I was dreading going in to the Apple Store to deal with my broken iphones.  However, I had such a great experience at this location, I decided to write a review. I've been to many Apple locations from NY to Fl over the years and I can't say the same of my experience.  As busy as they were, I was able to get an appt with the genius bar right away. I had two broken 4S iphones that needed to be looked at but I didn't clarify that I had two devices when I made the appt, Nonetheless, after the  Genius bar tech, Tim, took one of the phones, Guy Schiavi who was on the floor, made sure that the second phone was looked at as well. It was not a simple process as both phones required a thorough diagnosis but I was truly impressed by how patient and accommodating Guy was with us.  He worked on my tween's iphone and he walked her (us) through the process step by step and educated us on new tools on the iphone.  He also provided recommendations on phone accessories for me which I found very useful.  Unfortunately, the first phone (mine) was not fixable but my daughter's phone was fine.  More than anything, it was all about the pleasant experience and the special attention we received from Guy.  I will definitely return to this location for any future Apple needs!",2
5,"Gianna's has closed down.  *Sadface* :(  I will miss my Freebirds (vegan chicken steaks) and my GG Specials (vegan cheesesteaks)!!  At least I was able to bring my best friend from CA here during her visit in January when she was able to try the vegan pizza--it was the first time she had ever eaten anything resembling pizza in her life, and she loved it!",2
5,This is a great new addition to the Philadelphia restaurant scene! The Brussels sprouts were perfect! We had a delicious special of the day which was this Asian tofu dish! There is a sommelier on staff and they've got caught an exhaustive list of wines and other alcohol. This is a perfect place for a fancy date or special occasion and it's perfect located in the heart of center city!,2
5,My favorite Ny style pizza in Clearwater!!! And the Calzones are amazing. They work for 3 people!!!,2
5,"I have had several business dealings with Advanced Appliance Services and they've all been wonderful. They have repaired my refrigerator, my microwave, and my cooktop. Every time it has been a wonderful experience and I can't recommend them highly enough!",2
3,"If you find yourself in Nashville's West End craving a dirty, local Tex Mex joint with cold beers this is the place for you.  The restaurant is located right across the street from Vandy and Vandy memorial hospital, so it's pretty busy for lunch and dinner. You order on a paper menu where you check boxes next to what you want to eat. Very Sushi like or Which-Wich style, but fun none the less. The prices are not listed, so order carefully or you'll have a $17.00 tab like I did.The building is a dump. I'm serious. It's grunge and not the kind that was popular in the 90's. Celling tiles are about to fall due to water damage, dust collects on the fans and wall decor, the tables looks like they are from a yard sale, and this is all on purpose! The food is OK. Nothing to rave about. It's a local hole in the wall with descent food and homemade soft corn tortillas. The tortillas are great, but the rest of the food you're eating is a scale above taco bell. I'm giving the place a 3 due to the fact that they are accomplishing what they set out to accomplish. descent food in a descent setting. It's a dump serving local dirty style tex-mex for a reasonable price in a college town. What else could you ask for?",1
4,"After a long trip with many delays, I was looking for a quiet informal place to relax, eat and unwind.  Jones fit the bill.  The food was fair -- I had the ""hold the burger"" sandwich.  Good not great.  But the service was amazing.  The bartender loves his craft and takes it seriously.  He made several unusual but incredibly good drinks.  I would return any time I'm in phillie.",2
4,"I've been ordering from this place once a week since they opened. Since the Penn kids went home the delivery has been lightning fast (I am talking under 15 minutes on more than one occasion, which is insane), but I'm just glad to have a sushi delivery option in West Philly. (Mizu doesn't always delivery out to my block, and they're not on Grubhub anyway.)My only complaint is that I wish they would add non-crunchified spicy rolls to their menu, but I always request without tempura crumbs and they're happy to accommodate.",2
1,"I gave it one star because it doesn't give me an option to give it zero. This place sucks. Where should I start?? Okay, arrived at 7 pm with reservations and was seated in the dungeon. Fine. We ordered queso fundido with chorizo and got a weird looking cheese skillet with tortillas NOT chips. Odd! So had to ask for chips. Should've asked for a trash can. So we asked for some salsa to dress it up a bit -- that took an hour and I'm not exaggerating! The salsa was a thick mushy mess. Could turn the bowl upside down and nothng would've come out. Our food took an hour and a half, too. By that time, we were full on chips -- which were the only good thing on the menu! Oh... My favorite part... I ordered a side of beans and rice to go with my carne asada tacos -- which were more like unseasoned beef tips -- and I got a bowl of hard WHITE rice with refried beans on top. WHITE rice??? Seriously?!Terrible! Dont waste your time. Taco Bell serves better food than this and that isn't saying much! Service was just as bad!!",0
4,"Skip the fancy desert after dinner to go here, it's an excuse to walk around Broadway.  The homemade ice cream is really good.  Cake Mix is my favorite.   Great place to top off a date.",2
5,Amazing food. Ridiculously high quality ingredients. Definitely will come back whenever I get a chance.,2
1,"Made reservation a over a week ago with request to be near band. On arrival they had no record of it. And we are stuck in the back next to the bathroom. 5 stars for cocktail,food, band and Atmosphere. 1 stars for utter lack of organization.  The woman who took it said she was new. Always call to confirm I guess. Completely disappointed esp since we've had such amazing experiences here in the past.  There open tables near front and were told they were for people with reservations",0
5,"Great food, the service is excellent. The restaurant has a very warm and inviting feel. The manager or maybe it was the owner made it a point to go by every table to check on the guest. We decided to come here when we couldn't get a table at Pancake Pantry. So happy that happened because we would not have found such a wonderful breakfast spot.",2
2,"We went today for a birthday party. All I can say is wow! Yes it's that bad. It was super crowded and busy. The lockers are way too small for valuables, especially in the winter time. There aren't enough changing rooms, we waited 20-25 to change. The chlorine smell is strong! Literally nose burning, takes some time to get used too. The lazy river was a complete mess, kids running and getting out of the tubes. My daughter was almost knocked out of her tube. The family slide broke down for a few hours, we waited almost 45 minutes in line to find out we couldn't ride. The kid pool area with the basketball was very cold and again most of the kids were so rowdy. We have a 3 year old and there wasn't much she could do. The prices are absolutely ridiculous! $12.00 for chicken tenders, thankfully we ate before we got there. They don't allow you to take any food in, we stood in line to have the bags checked upon arrival, they were literally throwing food in the trash. It was quite sad to see. Great concept but again poor execution. We will not be back..",0
5,Have eaten here twice now on two separate trips to Nashville and each meal has been fantastic. The first trip I got the sweet potato pancakes which are so fluffy it is like they are made with clouds Delicious. The second go round I got some eggs and sausage which of course comes with a side of pancakes. Not only are the pancakes great but everything else was cooked perfectly and served with whipped butter that was probably made in heaven. My son got the wild blueberry pancakes which were equally fantastic. Get there before 8 AM and you shouldn't have to wait in the lines out the door. Make sure you get a free parking pass to put on the dash of your car as well. Great experience and worth getting up early for. Probably worth the wait too but I'm not into waiting in the snow like most folks on our first trip there!,2
3,"LOVE this place and have a constructive suggestion.I have to start by saying I've loved this place for several decades and will love it forever! However, on my last visit while we were eating inside the restaurant, I picked up a visitor that was not appreciated one bit--a BLACK WIDOW SPIDER on my purse. I noticed it as I was picking my purse up to leave and found I had set it on a HUGE web. As I looked closer, that web was not alone--there were many. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE get rid of these and clean regularly. I would like to eat my meals stress free! I would love to help clean this amazing place anytime.",1
5,Great brunch & bloody Mary's! Had the fried green tomato app & deviled egg app. Both were yummy. Pizza was good & big enough to share!,2
4,Foie Gras Soup.  YUM.  Pretty much everything on the menu is spicy and I enjoyed all of the courses.,2
5,"The best Italian I have had in years (and I'm Italian!!). Owner David is so friendly and makes everyone feel like his best friend. And it's not fake, it's genuine and fun!",2
4,Nice building. Great location. Most of the staff are nice with the exception of the condescending and rude property manager.,2
5,"What a fantastic and cozy place!  My friend and I ate here last night and we had such a wonderful time.  Our server was awesome and well prepared.  Not once did we feel rushed.  It's not too often you're in a restaurant and you feel like you could sit there the whole night drinking wine and eating.  This place and our server did exactly that.  From the starter, to the main entree to the dessert everything was to die for and the service was impeccable!  I started with the tomato soup while my friend started with the lamb meatballs.  The meatballs were AMAZING and the soup warmed me right up.  We both got the vegetable ragout and it was delicious.  I think every other mouthful came with a 'wow that's good' or 'there are so many flavors.'  I did appreciate how it wasn't too salty as well... or at least I couldn't tell it was.  And then dessert....apple bread pudding with brown butter ice cream.  I think that was the name of it anyway.  My friend and I almost came close to licking the plate!  We had wine by the glass and the pours are generous!!!   I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a restaurant so much! I can't wait to return with my husband and I hope the service is just as good on a weekend night.  This restaurant is truly a gem!",2
2,When I was shown to my seat of was still wet so I had to use the napkin to finish the job. Place was full and service was poor. I ordered the Atlantic Tuna melt - not convinced that the tuna was fresh and it was cold. I ate half only - no one asked why - not the place if you are in a hurry,0
5,"Very Informative, took us to haunted places (that we were planning to see anyways) and gave us funfilled stories behind each place. Kept us listening all night!",2
5,"Great services for a great price! Nail techs are friendly, and extremely thorough. I recommend the L'amour signature combo for a mani and pedi!",2
2,"After years of living here (and prompted by some drinking the night before), I finally decided to try Bui's for breakfast.  Everyone has been telling me that their breakfast sandwiches can't be beat.  Sadly, they can.  Maybe I got the wrong thing (and by reading the reviews, it sure seems like it), but I found Bui's to be lackluster.I will say that for 3.25, I got an enormous warm hoagie filled with eggs, bacon, a smidge of cheese, with some salt, pepper, and ketchup to taste.  The cheese was barely there, the added salt and the saltiness of the bacon was overpowering, and the bread was so doughy and thick it took over the whole sandwich.  This would have tasted better if I was hungover or super drunk, not relatively sober on a Thursday morning.Overall, I think I just ended up getting the wrong thing, but  I really wasn't impressed.  At least it's cheap.",0
5,"Great good-sized sandwiches, fresh, closest that you'll get to NY. Potato salad was awesome. Service is great. Will definitely be returning.",2
5,Neat place in the Funk Zone of Santa Barbara.... good selection of beers.... friendly staff.  Like having the taster option which they do offer.  It was another beautiful way to spend a Sunday!!!  Hope to return soon.,2
5,The food and service and the atmosphere was awsome and our waitress Penny i had the pancake combo my friend had the biscuit and gravy platter it was all hot and delicious we will definately be making this a regular spot yummmmm,2
5,"The enfrijoladaa are probably the best things I've ever eaten, period. Highly recommended. The competition next door is about as deep as you can get (la muada cafe) and yet I still keep coming back here.I'd recommend frequent visits until you've gotten through the entire menu. True gem.",2
1,"This place is a dirty mess. I have eaten here and have been disappointed at how dirty it was multiple times. Furthermore, the wait staff is obnoxious and had bad attitudes. Not only to i is, but other diners. Last night they let a woman with her DOGS and these dogs were all over the place. They smelled and was it awful for us and others. The food was not quality and the manager tried to make amends and knew this was a terrible experience. Avoid at all costs.",0
4,"The hubby and I have been here on multiple occasions and we have loved every part of the meal, every single time. Everyone from the servers to the bartender is very knowledgable about the menu and was able to immediately recommend items I could eat as-is, substitute or delete to make something safe for this Celiac girl to eat. The wine and cocktail menus are spot on. The food divine.  My only wish is that they would have a gluten-free dessert, we've always had to go elsewhere for something sweet. But that is not a big deal and I still want to go here time and time again.",2
1,My husband and I went here on a Friday evening. A woman cut right in front of us as we walked up to the hostess stand and got her party of four promptly seated. We then walked up to the hostess. They had six tables open as well as people finishing their meals at several other tables. Yet they insisted they could only seat us outside (it was a torrential downpour with thunder and lightning) or at the sushi bar. When we asked about how long it would be to wait for a table they first said about 30 minutes which we agreed to (despite there being 6 open tables) yet then a moment later the manager came over and said it was not possible to wait for a table.While I can not comment on the quality of food I can say their service is absolutely horrendous. I can not fathom why it was impossible to seat us at a table despite the 6 open tables or allow us to wait for one yet we could sit out in the storm or at the bar. I will not be returning here.,0
1,"Came in with my girlfriend a couple of months ago and ordered 2 drinks.  Girl ringing up my order seemed new, was running around attempting to make my coffee and asking the other barista (also at the counter) how to make the drinks we ordered AS HE CONTINUED TO MAKE HIS OWN DRINK AND TASTE TEST SYRUPS.  IT TOOK 15 minutes to make TWO DRINKS IN AN EMPTY SHOP.   The guy who sat there and stared at me as we waited never made one attempt to make my drink after I tipped 20% on the order.  Two coffees, $12.50 , 15 minute wait, empty shop.  Do the math.  This isn't the first time it has happened, staff is usually unfriendly.  I was coming in everyday and buying coffee but I got sick of spending my money with people who act like jerks.  I wrote an email to the shop and they never responded which is 100% proof they don't give a damn about bad service.  AS MUCH AS I LOVE COFFEE SHOPS I WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS PLACE.",0
4,"Went there for lunch and was pleasantly surprised, as having recently moved to Tampa from Los Angeles, I have been disappointed by the food.  However, I give Ploy Thai 4 stars, not just by Tampa standards, but by good food standards.  The food was very flavorful and the ingredients very fresh.",2
1,Tried this place the other day the pizza was not very good at all the place before this one was so much better all home made food with it would've stuck around,0
5,"Okay, my first review was in my early Yelping days and I know it did no justice for this place, although as you can see from the other Yelp reviews, this place has it's fanbase. I'm just another fan dropping a review or....""revamped"" review in my case, and just letting the Yelpdom know.....The quality of the food you get here for the price is ""Asinine"" some would even say ""Bananas"" but all in the best of ways. Here we go..The Top Deck Restaurant is home to the $4.99 Steak and Eggs for Breakfast, $4.99 Steak and Fries for Dinner and the ever popular.......(drumroll now) $5.99 Prime Rib dinner! And I know some may be apprehensive to trying steak and prime rib dinners for such a low cost. But let me tell you, you would be shocked at the quality and the deliciousness that you get from here. And did I mention the cost!They have other menu items here as well as to not just highlight what they seem to already have on their building (the steaks) the menu items range from..Chicken Dinners, Salads, Burritos, Pastas, Sandwiches, Soups, Burgers ect. This place has your general ""Diner"" style motif going on here. The service here is decent, it could vary depending on who you get, some of the waiters and waitresses seem like they get annoyed very easy. But I say ""suck it up"" with some of the best prices around you know you're going to get a lot of business. I usually leave my tips according to my service. I usually visit at least twice a day on my stays in Reno so I guess they get okay tips from me. The Prime Rib dinner honestly is the only thing I've ordered from here. Compared to big chain restaurants and my fav Prime Rib spot here in Nor Cal Mac's Ol House. This place holds its ground as a solid steakhouse.When you get the Prime Rib dinner it comes with the soup of the day which usually varies between..Split PeaClam ChowderChicken NoodleYou could have French Fries or Mashed Potatos for your side or even mixed veggies if you want to lay easy on the carbs. In closing, ""All hands on Deck"" all in the front, all in the back just like that! This is a place you ""Must"" visit when you are out here in Reno. I always end up meeting cool people in here and overall just enjoying the food here. This place is the true star of the Club Cal Neva, and I don't see this place losing it's shine anytime soon. As always, Yelp your own opinion and don't forget to take a picture of your plate!",2
5,"Visited Mangia for the first time today with my girlfriend. What a pleasant experience! Great drinks, amazing food, and friendly service. Would highly recommend. Glad to have great Italian food on this side of eighth Avenue!",2
2,"My wife bought a car here.  I handled the negotiations.  Our salesman was friendly and helpful.  Once the negotiations began however, our salesman left the picture and we were left to deal with the manager.  This experience was annoying.  I had done my research and shopped around.  The manager must not be accustomed to dealing with informed shoppers because he was obviously lying to me on a number of fronts.  Had my wife not needed the car immediately - and wanted a color that was only available this dealer - I would have moved on to another dealership.  My advice would be that if you have to come here be armed with knowledge and info on pricing from other dealers but in general I would probably buy from a different dealer if I had to do it over.",0
4,"This is a convenience store deli, so don't expect a neat restaurant setting or drink service (that's the only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5). I've had a Cuban press one time, and a breakfast sandwich at another time. Sandwiches are prepared upon your order and I was very happy with the food. Delicious! There are some tables inside and some outside on the dock, overlooking ocean. There is a more popular breakfast place (Maggie Mae's) in the same strip mall but taste-wise I must say I like this deli much better.",2
4,"I stopped in for lunch and ordered the hot pot with spicy broth, along with beef, chicken, shrimp dumplings, silken tofu, corn, potato, and rice noodles.  Lunch doesn't offer shrimp as does dinner and is priced at $16,95 vs $22.95 for dinner.  The food is good and there is a good variety available.  Order as much as you like.  The service is usually very good.  The formula works.",2
1,"Local to St. Pete and finally visited for the first time tonight - we will not be back.  We started wondering if Ted Peter's is associated with that place Dicks Last Resort where the staff is intentionally miserable.  While there was one server who was friendly (taller blond with a braided ponytail), the rest of the staff were simply unhappy people.  The majority of the time we were there they moped around behind the counter like zombies where a TV was on with the news.  Smiles were met with grumpy faces, waves from a smiling 17 month old were met with a obvious turn the other way, questions were met with short and unpleasant answers - it was depressing to say the least.  To say it nicely, the staff all need some hugs- as someone previously mentioned about Carl (again except for the blond with braided ponytail, she was pleasant). If you are looking to bring out of town guests to Ted Peter's, I don't recommend it. If the experience was like ours tonight, your guests will certainly leave with the wrong impression of the people of St. Pete.",0
3,"First understand how the ""Endless Sushi and Hibachi Eatery"" menu works. If you are starving you will die before you get enough food in your stomach to quell the pains. There is no ""bar"" to walk up to and select food from. You place your order from the special menu one dish at a time. The Sashimi is limited to eight pieces per person and its thin slices of fish with no rice. It was gone in seconds then i had to wait for the waitress to come back and take my next micro order of food. So the deal here is to make you wait 15 minutes between dishes so you either feel full or get tired of waiting. The policy is you must finish one dish before you can order another. Its an effective system to reduce consumption by dragging out the order process. Sushi - a little warm for my comfort level. Portions - sashimi is super small, the rolls were 4-6 pcs dependingOverall - its good but not if your starving. Your better off ordering off the regular menu.",1
5,"I love this place!  At first, I was a little worried because I'm not a fan of spicy food and I was told that Sichuan cuisine differs a little from the Chinese cuisine most people might be accustomed to but I loved it.  We had a waiter who was Chinese who gave us a lot of good information and was able to alter some dishes for us so for those who do not like their dishes too spicy or can't handle a lot of heat, do not worry, because it seems as though they can alter the spiciness to most of their dishes.  We were told which dishes that they were known for and which dishes are ""traditional"" so we tried the Dan Dan Noodles with less spice and it was delicious!  We were also recommended the Double Cooked Pork Belly, which is something I don't usually like because it's kind of fatty, but it turned out to be great as well.  They also have a cool little happy hour with some cheaper drinks so it's cool to get there a little before dinner, like we did and enjoy some cheaper drinks before dinner.  I wish they had some light beer available since I'm a girl and I'd like to have some lower calorie/lighter options for beer, but it's okay since they have a good wine selection too so I just chose to go with wine.  The food is relatively affordable, it's not Chinatown cheap, but it's not expensive either.  Overall, it was a very delicious meal in a fun, comfortable environment.  Will definitely go back.",2
4,"As far as atmosphere goes, I much prefer the nicer weather so I can sit outside...the inside is a bit dated but if the food's good, which it is, that's not really a factor.  Nice location by the Monon Trail which makes it a great stopping point when out for a bike ride.I'm not a vegetarian but their veggie options are outstanding--in fact, I order them more than their meatier options.  Make sure you order the veggie chips--they are delicious, and that includes the beets. Normally, a beet would have me spitting it out in my napkin but not here.  This may simply be testament to my belief that frying makes everything taste good, but I'm going to give them the credit.  All in all, a great low-key place to go get a meal with friends and linger...",2
5,"I absolutely love coming here. Great outdoor place with a wine selection you can't find anywhere else (not your typical wines you find in the grocery). The live music today was fabulous - and on a Thursday afternoon! Come here, get a few cheeses and wine and you will be satisfied. Oh, and the regular menu is crafty and artistic. It's a beautiful place with ambiance and on the palate.",2
5,"They are closed for one month holiday for the family.The whole experience the food, friendlinessp more.",2
4,"I ordered the Humus and Falafels and was good. The Falafels were one point with good texture, the Humus was great but I would have requested less olive oil. I will be going back next time I'm in the area.",2
5,"Excellent place to get a tattoo. I have had two done at B13 and am really pleased with both. One was with a group of people and the owner was able to fit all 4 of us in with a great sketch on really short notice. If you aren't sure who to go to, I've seen especially awesome work by Amanda, though everyone is great I'm sure.",2
2,"The hotel relies on their location for business. Do not let their lower prices fool you, parking costs add up quick here( $135 for 4 days). The entire time we were here there was only ever one person working the desk, which is fine at 7:30 on a weeknight, but not during peak check in hours on a Friday. The wait to check in stretched out the door and took an hour to get to the front.  Wasted vacation time. The close location to bourbon is good and bad- quick walk to many great bars and restaurants, but we witnessed a bum fight across the street. The homeless seem to congregate across the street and drink/sleep/heckle visitors. Not a horrible hotel but not a value in any respect.",0
3,"I was technically a member at this gym from February of 2012 until this past February, though I stopped going months before that point.When I signed up, I had great intentions of working out all of the time, but then my workload increased (okay, I AM listing off excuses, but whatever) and my back started hurting horribly to the point that I was having trouble walking (turns out I do have diagnosed back issues now.) I went in looking to cancel my contract -- thinking I just had to give two months notice. I had no idea upon signing the contract in February that it was a year-long commitment. It just wasn't made clear.I ended up paying a bulk price at once to cover my membership without debits each month on my bank account, but that honestly still peeves me a little when I think of Retro. I just think contracts should be made more clear up front.Otherwise, it's a pretty decent gym. $19.99/month, but they have some random bi-yearly charges, too, which would spike up the per month price if you really think about it. The bathrooms were clean and the machines were nice. I was always one of those girls who would go in the movie theater area - a nice perk.Now if my boyfriend was the one writing this review, it would have 10 stars up top. He is there whenever he has a free second!",1

5,"Was blown away by this place. Not the highest rated BBQ place in town, but tried it after a suggestion from a local.I think I liked this place so much because the brisket rib is heavy on black pepper.  I like peppery meats and jerky, so this peppery crusted brisket was right up my alley.The sides were good, and didn't seem like an after thought. Ribs were tender and fall off the bone.",2
5,Everything was so smooth today for the grand opening.  This is our new go to place to eat. Wil be back again and again. Very nice on the inside and out.,2
5,"Well...what can I say that really hasn't been said?My wife and I have been coming to Yats in Broad Ripple for at least four years now, so I like to think that maybe I got the knowledge to give it a fair and honest review.  I've recently taken my son there, along with my daughter, my daughter in law, friends, etc. I like sharing good food places with friends, and the more people I bring in, the more I like it.I'll bring up the ""Cons"" first before I get into the ""Pros"".1: The Broad Ripple establishment: Parking can sometimes be a chore on that busy street. This is not Yats fault, and there is really nothing they can do about it, when you have Jazz Kitchen, Fresh Market, Sams Gyros, (expanded into the old Army surplus store), all on the same block. You just find a place and park. Be ready to walk a block or two. And WATCH while crossing that intersection.2:  The Place itself can get VERY crowded. If I have ONE main issue with the place, it's not the food, or the staff, but the customers. Some of them seem not to understand (or they simply don't care), that the seating is limited, (the place is small), and thus they like to just ""hang out"" at the tables for a while after they eat, while other people are standing around looking for a place to sit. I've actually had to ask people if they would be so kind as to let other folks have their table since they could carry their conversations on outside.  Too many youthful hipsters with their egos....3: I would say the biggest ""Con"" in the food is sometimes the run out. There's been times I've been craving the chili cheese etouffe and come in only to have them say ""Sorry we ran out 10 minutes ago""...And now the ""Pros""....1: Food:  The chili cheese etouffe and the mang choux chicken are my favorites.  There's been times that I have gone back and ordered seconds. Not because the portions are so small, but simply because it was so good. My son says that the Peanut Butter Pie is probably the best pie he has ever tasted.2: Service: The service is excellent with a good staff.  Joe is an amazing man and very wonderful and friendly.3: Atmosphere: A nice funky mix of New Orleans-esque kitsch and Broad Ripple weirdness seem to mesh quite well together. I've wanted the picture of the red cat for years. Sigh....4: A nice and varied collection of peppers, salts, and spices for your food. 5: Speaking of the food once again. The food has enough spice for those of us with ""Anglo"" tastes, and there is enough variation of spices to allow people to push it up to ""nuclear"" in hotness.  Overall, this has become one of my most favorite places to eat. We did try the old Mass. Ave, location twice and while the food was good, the staffs attitude was a bit of a letdown. They are moving to a new location so hopefully there, they will do better things.If I was to recommend this I would say ""Yes!""....Thanks for reading....",2
3,"Food was good service was great. We all liked the beer variety, and the bourbon list is amazing. We started with pork cracklings and fried green tomatoes. You don't get many cracklings but they are really good. The tomatoes were actually cooked almost perfect a few were alittle dark but still delicious. I order smoked sausage, it was more like a spicy smoke sausage you buy at your local price chopper. Note this I thought I was ordering a sausage plate but I only got a bare plate full of sausage no sides no bread. My wife got the veggie burger and sweet pot fries, burger was so so fries were good. The couple with us said they liked there's so I cannot contest. The service and atmosphere is where it was at. Oh I did try some of my buddies pulled pork and it was really good, remembered now cause I wish I would have ordered it",1
5,Exactly what you want a dive bar to be. I'm lucky to have graced its presence. In town with a world traveling band and couldn't have been a better atmosphere.,2
3,"pros: -Location is great.  5 minute walk to Knitting Factory music venue, record store, plenty of restaurants and shops-Sweet pool and hot tub-large room with huge windows and a great view of downtown-$10 pet fee-1PM check out time-nice fridgecons:-toilet appeared to have not been cleaned-room was very hot when we entered (AC worked and cooled it town after about 30 minutes though, so no big deal)-pathetic breakfast-unfriendly staff",1
4,"This place was awesome. It's expensive, but pretty cool views of the arch. The only reason it's not a 5 star review is because you have to wait in line for a while for the elevator, but not a big deal. Would definitely recommend.",2
4,"Once, my salad had dirt in it. Seriously.It was like it was plucked from the ground that very moment and didn't get a bath.Oh well. I ordered the Kogut's Curry - roasted chicken, melted Swiss and cheddar with curried mayonnaise on Russian black bread. It was mighty greasy, but mighty tasty too, and if there was dirt in it, it blended in with the bread.I've since been here for their farmer dinners, where a local farmer sources the produce/meat/cheese and they create a special meal around the ingredients. It was lovely. Eggplant stuffed with goat cheese and tomatoes and sauteed summer squash from Biver Farms.I've obviously gotten over my dirt phobia. Just proves the food here is farm fresh. I'm pulling for the clean, farm fresh approach, though.",2
5,Usually packed with conference/event attendees from the nearby Convention Center. Totally worth the wait in line. They tend to have quick turnovers so the wait isn't all that long. If you go definitely try their freshly made in house juices. That's their specialty but their food is also great; I never leave a morsel on my plate (yes the manager teased me about this and gave me free coffee lol). The owners are great and that's reflected in the staff they hire.,2
5,Fantastic food. Delightful and amazing service. They always put the customer first! Best shakes this side of the bay! Make sure to try the pork sandwich when on special and the jungle juice shake!,2
3,"Food is solid and they have many unique options such as elk and wild boar. Definitely check out their menu if you are interested. Small portion compared to most burger places. The only downside is that the service is super slow - not enough waiter/waitresses. To be honest, this place doesn't have to be a sit down restaurant and will do just fine allowing self service. My roommate and I waited over 40 minutes for our burgers, which was a bit annoying.",1
5,Awesome place the steak tacos are amazing and the rum bucket is definitely a must !!! I'm very picky when it comes to food and drinks and I give this place 5 stars plus ! Great atmosphere great service . Jamie was the best server/bartender!!,2
3,"They are a little pricey. The food was mediocre at best. It's not a place I would be in rush to to eat again. However, I would eat again because of the service. The ladies were very nice and engaging.",1
4,"My boyfriend and I needed a quick bite and wanted some solid pizza. We were not disappointed. This place was so good. The pizza slices are HUGE and they put so much toppings on speciality slices you will not be disappointed. Oh and the mozz sticks are perfect !!! I recommend x10 for some solid pizza etc in philly, cute little place, love the local feels.",2
5,"Why did it take me so long to return? Oh gods of HCV, i've missed you so!  I came here for a quick bite after shopping on Walnut.  It was peak lunch time and they were busy! Be patient, it's definitely worth the wait.  I ordered the ""chicken sandwich"".  Anytime i can enjoy a delicious sandwich is a winner to me.  Do yourself a favor and grab a sandwich, get a groothie, and walk to the park and enjoy. Your welcome!",2
4,"Hot Stuff is pretty good. Another reviewer said that it isn't that hot on the Nashville hot chicken scale, and I agree. I requested the hottest they got and it rates about a regular hot at Prince's. Not entirely a deal breaker for me, as the flavor is actually really good.  In terms of flavor, I like Pepperfire, for heat, 400 degrees and Prince's (and very surprisingly Wingbasket). I have yet to try Bolton's but I plan to very soon. The guys at Hot Stuff also have hot ribs which seems really interesting, and I'll review again when I get around to trying it. They also have hot chicken salad, so if you're into plants and all that, there it is.  The menu is a lil diverse, so unlike the original hot chicken joints, this place has fish and ribs too.All in all, it's good when you're on the south side and want some hot chicken.  It's not the hottest chicken, but it's still good.  Ordering is best called in.",2
3,"Their rice is the fluffy kind that's closer to pilaf, which really disappoints me, other than that their food is okay and the service is good. Nothing to write home about but will do in a pinch.",1
5,"Simply a beautiful train station, with gorgeous architecture and ceiling design.  Very clean and easy to navigate with clear announcements, helpful employees, and signs everywhere.  Plenty of food options and seating.  I definitely wouldn't mind coming through here again if the need arises.  I wish Newark Penn Station would do some work to be more like this place.",2
2,"Employees need to be coached in hygiene and proper food handling techniques. Was a frequent visitor but that one gross employee made me notice other things and question whether I would come back and as of yet I have not. I messaged them previously and didn't receive any replies.Food is usually decent and over priced but didn't mind until that one nasty guy.Message:We eat here quite regularly but I witnessed something extremely disturbing and unsanitary today that I would really like to consult management about. An employee who was both taking cash and serving food proceeded to grab fruits with his bare hands (unwashed) then wipe his hands on the back of his pants. He then went back to taking orders where he used his arm and same hand to wipe his nose, sniffed, and touched his hair. I cannot tell you how disgusted I was as it made me look to other areas of sanitation lapses as well.  Thank you.",0
5,We did the regular tasting menu with a few bottles of wine--possibly the best meal I've ever had.  The chef clearly focuses on great textures and on selecting a few key ingredients with strong flavors in their own right (the pigs feet meatballs were outstanding).  The service was absolutely perfect and much appreciated having just eaten at another place where I felt rushed through my dinner.  Absolutely excellent!,2
5,"Soooooo good! Tuesday is the night to go! Selection of 1/2 price tapas and Sangria/margaritas are $5.00. We loved the Fried Manchego, Hot Cauiliflower, and Camarones! This was over the top unique and tasty!!",2
1,"My girlfriend and I decided to try Kalamata's last night at around 7:30. The guy at the counter asked us if we're ready to order even before we had the chance to look at the menu properly, not once but multiple times. We ordered 2 lamb gyros, a side order of roasted potatoes and the tabouleh. The potatoes came out extremely fast and were lukewarm at best. Either they were premade, and ""microwaved to order"" or were just sitting on a hot plate. Not something I'd expect from any restaurant. The tabouleh was SOUR - like salad dunked in a bottle of fish sauce sour. We decided to tell the guy upfront our issues with the tabouleh but all we got out of him was ""This is our recipe. This is the way we make it. It's fine if you don't like it, but this is how we make it"". I agree I have no idea what authentic tabouleh tastes like, or how to make it, but I have tasted GOOD tabouleh in the past, and this was far from it. I pity the people who've eaten tabouleh only at this establishment because they're really missing out. The gyros were pedestrian at best, under-seasoned and most of all under-sauced. The veggies were on one side of the pita, the meat on the other - so you'd never get a mouthful of veggies+meat and only one side of the pocket had the sauce. Suspecting another ""This is how we sauce our gyros. This is our recipe"" moment, we decided to finish our food ASAP.Finally, the worst offense was that the guy starts closing up shop while we're still eating. Really? I've no idea how this place got 4 stars on yelp, but there are way better restaurants in Nashville for Mediterranean food.",0
5,"We were really impressed with the environment, service, pricing, and quality of the food. They have a good variety of food and we really enjoyed everything we got, especially the flatbread. We had our kids with us and I appreciated the variety included in the kid's meals, as many times it seems like kids meals are an afterthought with not many good (or healthy) options.",2
5,"New place, and I hope they keep up the great work! Great service, GREAT Food, Huge portions ( and I mean huge.), and almost every entree dish under $15! We had Jumbo fried shrimp, and they were jumbo, lighly battered, not greasy. Also had shrimp pasta, there was as much shrimp as pasta. Parking can be a bit challenging, but worth the patience.",2
5,"HipCityVeg is a vegan fast food restaurant. The food is delicious and addicting. Don't expect it to be more than what it is and you will be really satisfied with your experience. I've ordered delivery from them three times and have dined in once. The delivery was exceptionally quick, which makes me believe that most of the food is already made before you order it. It's not piping hot and fresh, but it still tastes great. The buffalo bella and fries are definitely my favorite items. If you're looking for something more upscale, try Vedge, but if you're starved and you need a quick vegan bite delivered to your office quickly, you can't go wrong with HipCity.",2
5,"Happened upon this place (visiting family from out of town) and were happy to get a quick and yummy bite before heading to meet up with family. It's a small little place with a lot of classic Italian dishes, some sandwiches and St. Louis-style pizza options. My husband and I split a sandwich and got Italian wedding soup to go with it! The lady at the counter was super nice and friendly. Would definitely recommend stopping in! Parking is in the lot and sandwiches are about $10. There are $10 lunch specials too.",2
4,"My husband and I went for a weekend getaway to go snowboarding, and decided to stay at the grand spa suite. The total cost was around 300$ for two nights.  The room was pretty nice , not bad for a room a Reno. But I thought the room was going to be a bit bigger compared toPictures I saw online. It seemed like the jacuzzi and bed took up 75% of the room.But other than that, it was quiet , staff was friendly , and checking in & out was a breeze due to express checkout/in",2
5,"Yelp comes through again!  Reasonable prices, huge portions, and amazing flavors!  I got a pulled pork sandwich, baked beans, and fried okra...OMG, yum!!!",2
4,"The fried avacado was surprising choice.  The flavor Is primarily derived from the sauce, But still quite good.  The tuna salad cones with a generous whole tuna steak. It was a pleasant surprise to see giant blueberries on the accompanying salad, as I wasn't expecting it in february.  Not too crowded for lunch. Service was attentive and am sorry I can't remember our servers name, as she was delightful.",2
3,"Very averageIt is convenient and fast.Wonton soup - good value- wontons are too heavy,soup a little greasyHad chicken fried rice- underwhelmingYellow rice, onions, a little chicken not very flavorfulI wish it was better",1
5,"West Ave Grill is a  Must Go....been coming here for years and the food and service are amazing. Never a bad experience here at #WAG. The Mile High Waffle is great and always get a good omelette to share. Today I switch it up and got the Buffalo Fried Chicken Eggs Benedict over the homemade biscuits and it was amazing! Great atmosphere, home type vibe, friendly staff and management and great location to take walks after a full stomach. Looking forward to my next visit....#WAG",2
2,"We stopped by the Cafe to have lunch before exploring the exhibits.  The food was okay, but we were turned off by the service.  As soon as we entered, the cafe staff are just chatting by the service counter.  It took a few minutes for someone to take our order.  After we ordered our food and just as we were about to sit down, one of the service people made a sarcastic comment about us getting our food free that made me feel uncomfortable.  I guess the lady at the counter forgot to ring up my husband's sandwich.  Throughout our meal, we could clearly hear the cafe staff gossiping and saying bad things about their coworker. So what would have been a somewhat enjoyable meal, was pretty miserable listening to people complain about each other.  If you have to gossip about your coworker behind their back, please go somewhere where customers cannot hear you.  Other than that, the food was okay. Nothing spectacular.  I ordered a half club sandwich with a cup of broccoli and cheese soup.  The sandwich was decent, but the soup had an off-putting taste.  My husband's salad was good and I wish I had ordered that instead.  I'll probably eat at the Cafe again, but sit closer to the counter as to avoid all the inter-cafe gossip.",0
5,"Amy, the owner and instructor, is awesone!!  The instructions she delivers are great for beginners and those with experience alike.  I'm going back again next week!",2
4,"I came for a blow out with Megan and was happy with the cute, tiny salon. Everyone was very friendly and my hair looked lovely for 3 days. I will definitely consider coming back for more services, especially if they have a special :)",2
4,"Awesome experience! I love how the audience is an integral part of the performance. These actors are hilarious and are great with handling the oddest of suggestions. I also won a free ticket by volunterring to go on stage and I believe they do this every show so if you want a chance to win- volunteer.If you want to try something different on a Friday night this is a good activity. There is street parking available, public transporation near by, and it's in a good area if you want to get food/drinks before or after the show. 4 stars only because of the small venue and the chairs are kind of uncomfortable.",2
3,"I have been to the Carollwood location many times and I was looking forward to the opening for months since I found out in July since this location is closer to me. Starting with a positive. The food was great! However, the criticisms come from the moment I walked into the restaurant. A server who was at the desk completely ignored us as we entered. A young man with no sense of urgency came from across the room where he was seated playing with his phone. We were seated. Our server was actually at our table within minutes but, like I read another review, did not have much of a personality. We ordered food as I was noticing other customers entering. They were also not seated quickly even there seem to be plenty of staff. This happened a few times. The restaurant was filling up quickly and there seemed to be a dispute and confusion about which servers were assigned to which tables. I witnessed at least 2 parties wait at least 5 minutes before a server came to greet and get drink orders. My final complaint is that my waitress forgot an important detail in my order and I was forced to wait too long watching my mother eat her food before I got my breakfast. I do hope that with a little training and good management that service will improve. Sincerely.",1
4,"I called into the office saying Im going to be 20 min. late to my appointment because I was in traffic. The receptionist made me feel irresponsible telling me the hygienist won t have time to do my cleaning! She told me the hygienist won t do my whole cleaning because she has LUNCH at 12 for an hour! It was my first apt so I had made apt for exam, X-ray and cleaning. I wanted to reschedule than but she told me I can t because I bought a Groupon and I can t be rescheduled. Just that experience put a bad taste in my mouth I still drove and cam in 10 min late I filled the paperwork and went inside to the room downstairs. The tv wasn t on the music was only playing, she took x-rays and than started scraping my teeth which now they hurt. They didn t hurt before! Than the doctor came in told me the filing cost about $150-255 because I don t have insurance. I will to go here again just because of the rude receptionist, and I didn t feel comfortable there.",2
4,"Walking in, it took a bit to be greeted and seated....and the restaurant had only about 10 people sitting. However, once we sat down, and handed menu's, I knew this was gonna be good. Janie had the Lasagna, which had spinach inside.....very good!  I had ravioli with a mushroom sauce and ravioli with veal an maranaria sauce....really good!! Thought I was back in Italy!! Definitely an authentic experience.",2
5,Read a lot of reviews that mention this is a must see while in Santa Barbara. It certainly was. The architecture and landscaping on the property was beautiful. There is a tower you can climb up to get a 360 view of Santa Barbara. There were showing free movies in the evenings.,2
5,"Awesome food! Great service! Amazing owner! Best place to eat in Reno. Very cheap food considering the quality , the cleanliness and the taste, you won't regret it if you try it I promise!!",2
1,I got Bait & Switched too!!!!  They had the exact used Hyundai Accent I wanted on their website for 2 weeks.  I called to make an appointment for later the same day and drove an hour from Philly to get there. Upon arrival they informed me that it had been sold just 2 hours prior to my appointment but no one called to inform me.  Instead they were offering me a brand new car which would have been thousands more!  I just checked on their website and the car is still listed in their inventory!!!,0
5,"A great place to listen to live music and have an afternoon cocktail or three. The hodgepodge seating in the backyard gave it a fun, quirky feel and the drinks were delicious and affordable  (but happy hour helped, too). The cheese plate was also quite yums in the tums. Bacchanal is a fun, memorable, tasty way to spend a day.",2
1,"Tonight I was really disappointed. I called and placed a take out our about 45-1hr prior to closing. I ordered a chicken Fajita and chicken enchiladas with chips and dip. The only thing right was the chips and dip, if you count that each chip was broke then maybe not. I should have taking pics of this mess I was given but I was to upset once I drove all the way home only to realize my order was WRONG and MISSING.. had no black beans and rice or sides for my enchiladas. You could barley see any cheese. I called immediately and spoke with the manager and was told that the enchiladas would been taken off my bill. No dinner than I hung up and opened the burrito I noticed I had no fajita peppers... none just rice beans and chicken..  I immediately called back. The manager agreed that the orders were wrong and she apologized and asked if I was close she would have the order remade, and take the entire order off my bill. Since I was feeding more than myself, I decided that I would return for the remade order so my teenager would eat tonight as planned. Well.. I drive 10 minutes back and get my remade order and another apology. The worse part about this is I should have cut my losses... but this is the same place that I hosted by friends Bridal shower in the private dining hall and the service was amazing, this is the same place that I have come for happy hours but tonight I should have said NO!! Get home and bam.. burrito smelled great looked great but NO Chicken.. NONE.. just beans, peppers, rice and cheese even tasted the cilantro but Where is the Chicken?? I didn't bother to call back this time. I'm gonna just cut my losses and not go back. Not a good feeling when you really want something tasty to get and get turned off Twice!! My nephew agrees.. he just went to Wendy's. Now I hope my refund is correct. Seems likely the next problem.",0
5,Wow!! Awesome place. This is my first yelp review because this place is so great. Being Hispanic I am really impressed with the quality and authenticity of the food at Lima Fusion. I would definitely return to eat here again.,2
3,This was a much needed stop for our group. The day was perfect for outdoor seating so we pulled 2 tables together. We had shrimp po boys the shrimp was great and the bread was so fresh. We had our dog and the waitress brought our dog a cold bowl of water without us even asking. This place has some bad reviews but not from our group of 5. We were all pleased and would recommend,1
3,"Only game in town.  I occasionally like to go here because they have fabulous crab cakes.  However, three stars because the service was so god awful.  We were there on a Tuesday night & the restaurant was not crowded.  It took 1hour and 15 minutes to receive our entrees.  No joke.  Of those entrees, two were kids' meals and one was a cheeseburger.  The food was fine...but really 45 minutes to wait for a salad?  We were told that the delay was b/c we ordered wings first and there was a table of 10 in the other room.  OK...It wasn't until i suggested that they bring the kids' meals after 45 minutes that the waitress even figured out something might be wrong.  Save your money...stay home for Kraft mac n cheese next time.",1
5,Awesome service! Food is made quickly but accurately. It is so fresh. I just wish they delivered to me but it's good enough that I am willing to drive there to get it. Also try their day old bread for .50. It is a full baguette and makes great garlic bread to accompany your dinner!,2
5,"Yes yes yes! What an excellent addition to newtown. We have eaten in twice and gotten take out multiple times. Our favorites are the chicken tikka masala, lamb korma, papdi chaat, and aloo tiki chaat. Everything we have tried so far has been delicious.",2
5,"Wow!!! This place is awesome!!! We ordered a bunch of breakfast stuff and it was all perfect! I would suggest the corned beef hash and ham. I would also suggest asking for Pam because she was super friendly and welcoming!This place is exactly what I actually want when I go to Perkins or IHOP or Denny's, but can never get at those places. Highly recommended!!!!",2
2,"I was here on a Tuesday, so I ordered the Tuesday special of 5 boneless wings for $2.75. It took so long to get my order that they threw in five extra ones for free as consolation. I also had a strawberry shake. The wings were good. My main complaint is that the menu is misleading. It says that the wings come with dressing and veggie sticks if you request them. That implies that they are free, but actually the sticks were $1.49 and the dressing (which was bad) was $1.10.",0
4,This restaurant was pretty good; i'll admit it! I went here in the late evening with my boyfriend to have a nice date! He insisted on us ordering a milkshake and i'm SO GLAD that he did. The milkshake was probably one of the best ones i've had in my lifetime. The food was pretty good and so was the service but something was a little off. I couldn't tell what it was but i just got a really strange vibe from the restaurant. Maybe i'm just being crazy!,2
2,I have never gone anywhere else but here. I always have one person do my nails and she does a great job. When I get a ped. I just get whoever is available.  Well I will not do that again.  The girl that did them did a horrible job acted like it she knew what I wanted but she did not do it like I wanted.    Get your crap together and if u don't know how to do something then say u don't.,0
2,"Meh. This pizza was basically a deep-dish grease pie. Not my style at all.The wings were OK but nothing special. We got ranch as a dipping sauce instead of blue cheese, which I thought was a little weird.We probably won't be going back here. It wasn't special.",0
4,"Ted Drewes seems to be a local hangout in St. Louis.  I was in town for a couple of days with friends I knew and they took me to Ted Drewes, claiming it was a ""must see"" in St. Louis.  It's pretty tasty, but I don't understand why it's the attraction that it is.  Their custard is delicious, but it's rivalled by other ice cream and yogurt places.  Their combinations are delicious though!  If you want to get a taste of St. Louis and great custard, you've got to visit Ted Drewes.",2
5,So glad I was able to eat at The Farm and Fisherman before it closes! I took my boyfriend there for his birthday last night and it was by far our favorite farm to table restaurant in Philly. We shared the Bloody Beet Steak for starters - very flavorful and juicy! Just a heads up this is a beet and not an actual steak :)I got the asparagus risotto for a second course which was super rich and creamy. Then I had the chicken for my main course. The meat was super fresh and moist but I wasn't loving the cheese spätzle that it was prepared with. We had 5 total dishes for only $100 which I think is a tremendous value for the high quality and size of the meals. And it's a BYOB so you can save money on booze!,2
2,"Cute place. But lame liquor selection and the pizza by the slice served at 10pm on a thurs was old and burnt. Good bartender. Overall, should be upping their game big time if they're going to be an off-the-beaten path bar right downtown. Beer selection was decent. Overall, not very impressed and probably won't be back unless I have to.",0
1,no bueno...annoyed I couldn't get any service and the prices are a joke.,0
5,"One of the best burgers in Philly!Low key joint with just a few tables and the kitchen in the dining room. But, don't let the modest face fool you, this place rocks!Menu is creative and fully customizable. Burgers are cooked on a flattop, perfectly seared, juicy, slightly charred. Fries are hand cut, fried fresh, perfectly crispy and salty. What more could you ask for from a burger place? Pro tip - Download the SPOT app for a rewards program and some good coupons (aka free fries!).",2
4,"Not an abundance of great sushi in Nashville, but Samurai is helping that. The fish is fresh and the rolls are a healthy size. I had the Crazy Monkey roll with a green salad. The 8 piece roll came loaded with fish and a glaze of eel sauce. The salad was good but the ginger dressing was a little overwhelming. Won't stop me from getting it again though. The restaurant itself is a quaint and has a great feel for a sushi restaurant l. Perfect for a date or to come with a group of friends.",2
4,Gator burger top of the line...sleeper spot dont miss.,2
5,"FINALLY!! st. louis has a place at which i look forward to eating when i am visiting!!i have been here twice and there is just no competition. the food is delicious, fresh, (dare i say?) even a little challenging! which we love. people reviewing here who didn't love the food are not adventurous. so, if you're not that type, try some place on the hill where you can drown your blown-out tastebuds in marinara or a nice mediocre alfredo sauce.the cocktails are perfect. everything we ate was perfect. and we left feeling sated but not overfed, as is often the case at places in the midwest.the last time we ate at here was the day after xmas, and we're STILL reminiscing. :)i love that they only accommodate groups of four or less. this really adds to the general charm of the place and speaks to the quality of the food. clearly, they're taking their time and making every dish perfect back in the kitchen, which you just cannot do when a table of eight tromps through. the dishes on the menu are made for sharing, and are the perfect size for 3 or 4 people, so it makes sense in this way too. it also means that the noise level is low. it's such a refreshing break from all the other utterly characterless food in st. louis.",2
3,Good BBQ!  Definitely more of an upscale type of BBQ...ribs were the best choice!,1
4,"Born and raised in south Jersey I consider myself both a diner connoisseur and diner snob. This one is great!  A lot of locals eat here and the waitresses have worked here for quite some time. Breakfast and lunch are really yummy.  Food comes out quickly and service is prompt.  Really good quality food for ""just a diner"" and they recently expanded for more space- hooray! Great value plan to spend about 10-14$ for a good size meal.",2
5,"Outstanding customer service! And my car is driving great now! Brian and the other guys walked me through the work I needed on my car, and I never once felt taken advantage of or blindsided. I ended up needing four new tires and a new hub cap, talk about bad news! But they were extremely professional, personable, and treated me like a human being. I've experienced auto shops that treat me like an idiot, that do a poor job fixing my car, or that tell me I need extra work done (for a fee, of course). It turns out I did need ""extra"" work, but Brian showed me the damage, explained the process, and showed a lot of compassion. And now my car is remarkably better. I will definitely be back in the future, and I would recommend Tires Plus in Flourtown to anyone.",2
1,"Stay away. My husband and I stopped here this afternoon to use a gift card given to us a long time ago. We do not normally buy cold stone ice cream, and we're pretty easy to please. All we were looking for was a nice cold treat on a hot day- what we got was a small ice cream that was way too sweet (yes, even for ice cream!), and a chocolate shake that was not good, for about $11. My husband took one sip of his shake and pushed it away. I took a taste and agreed that something was not right. It had a distinctly sour, bitter aftertaste. While I finished my ice cream, he debated about whether he wanted something else instead. Since the ingredients seemed to be the problem, he decided did not want something else, even though my ice cream seemed fine. When I took the shake back to the register and explained the problem, we were told we could not receive a refund, only a replacement. Both of us had an upset stomach for about two hours afterwards, and neither of us had more than a sip or two. Poor customer service, bad ingredients. Food poisoning is not worth $11, so we simply left.Poor customer service is my biggest pet peeve- as someone who has worked in customer service and international sales for four years, I promise you- it's really not THAT difficult of a task to make sure your customer is happy, even if there is a language/geographical barrier (today, there was neither). While I realize that the employee I spoke to is probably a minimum wage high school student, store policies that young woman has to follow are set by real adults. Whoever set the policies for this store clearly is not doing their job!Shame on you, coldstone, for trying to give my (active-duty & a veteran) husband food poisoning on Memorial Day, and refusing to make any real attempt to make amends. Don't worry, you sure as hell won't see us again, ever. Fool me once....",0
2,"We had Sunday brunch and most of our group was really disappointed. Several wanted the house drink with pomegranate and amazingly they were out of pomegranate. For food we started with the smoked oysters which were interesting. The bread and butter that came with the food were good too. But then came the entrees. The duck was wayyyyyy oversalted. Clearly the duck was brined but someone lost control of the salt with the rest of the dish.  The breakfast with eggs were requested over easy. One egg was cooked well but the other still had a clear white. The shrimp and grits were oily with grease or butter but the person liked the flavors. The catfish eaters said that it was okay but the rolls were not great. Was the food bad? No. Was the service bad? No. Would any of the six of us go back? No.  At the end we heard the couple to my left Complain to the waitress that her eggs weren't cooked. And then the waiterBrought over the manager to the table to our right and he said to one of the men  ""I'm sorry your meal wasn't right.""  We don't know what that issue was. Based on all the other amazing reviews we can only think that either the chef was out of town on Sunday or they have a new chef who needs to be replaced",0
4,"Let me first say that I went here on a Saturday which I would never do so needless to say I had to wait but not very long. I am picky about my nails and I usually get pink and white American which requires a softer white. They only have one bright white for their pink and white nails. I really needed my nails done so I went with it. I actually like it! The guy who did my nails, Le, did a great job and got my nails just right! He took a bit longer than I would have preferred but if it means great looking nails then I'm ok with it! Overall I would recommend this place, but like anywhere else you might want to go during the week!",2
2,"The food is not really authentically Mexican. I liked the cute idea of the little doll to put under your pillow to scare bad dreams away, not sure it is related to the Mexican culture though. I was hoping for something truly Mexican. The service was just ok, not too knowledgeable about their food items.",0
4,"Went into Ashley today, was met by Andre(Powell)  the salesperson when we entered the store he was very courteous and nice.I thought the buying process was gonna be painful but Andre made the process real enjoyable and he was very knowledgeable of all things we asked of him...Keep Up The Great Job!",2
3,Tandoor is good. The buffet is definitely worth 12 bucks. There's chai and desserts as well as a salad bar. I got 2 plates worth of food and was very satisfied. Seems like more of a take out or family style place but it's always quiet when I go. The service is alright but since I get the buffet it doesn't really matter. The waiter still came by the table very often. This will always be my go to for Indian food in Philadelphia.,1
4,Love this place finally a Korean BBQ place that like California.  You all have to give this place some time cause they just opened and people giving out 1 stars.  Not true this place is 4 for a restaurant that just opened.  For you people who don't like the wait don't go back then that simple.  This place has good meats and give out large portions and you can take your left overs home.  The wait is worth it be thankful that they finally have a real Korean BBQ place in Louisiana.,2
5,"What a little neighbourhood gem! Amazing espresso drinks, friendly staff, and if you follow their tweets you can salivate over your iPhone as you read about their daily breakfast/lunch menu. Yeah it's a little as small but I've only done takeaway. Planning to eat in really isn't an option in the winter without the patio space.",2
4,"Solid, but nothing ground breaking or innovative. People dress business casual, or so it seemed when we went. No need to stress too hard about it though. There was a wait, even though we had reserved and there was lot of space in the back. Very good Liver Pâté with the assorted cheeses and such. Dessert was lackluster. Overall, more in the positive than the negative",2
1,"Went on the Cupcake and Macaroon Tour last weekend.  We went to four places.  The first business was a glorified coffee shop.  No cupcakes or macaroons. We were given half of a ricotta cookie.  Although delicious, it was not a cupcake or macaroon.  The second place gave us a quarter of a cupcake. They did not have enough of each flavor, so when it was my turn, the one I wanted was gone. The third establishment was so awful, they should have paid me to try their sample.  It was a vegan bakery free of gluten, dairy, nut, soy, egg and any other allergen one can think of.  I am sensitive to people with food allergies as my husband has them, but I'm not sure why this establishment was included.  How can a cupcake taste good after you've removed all of the key ingredients?  The last place we went to was the one that was supposed to have macaroons.  We were told they ""ran out"" and instead received a quarter of a defrosted mediocre cupcake.  How do I know it had been frozen and not fresh?  It was still partially frozen in the center!  Luckily, it was a beautiful day to be outside, because this tour left a lot to be desired.",0
5,I've had about all of their sandwiches and visit this place when I'm in the area during lunch.  I think their bread is great and their prices are phenomenal.  I also enjoy their spring rolls.,2
5,"This is a great independent auto shop--I have been going here about 4 years. They service all types of cars, and are very honest and knowledgeable. I had an issue with a warrantied battery replacement, and it turned out that I owed a portion of the battery costs after they submitted the claim. They didn't call me and tell me that I owed them the money. They just noted it on my file until the next time I came in for service, which wasn't until months later--they didn't have to wait like that, but they did without me even asking.  The shop is super clean, the owners are super nice, and they always have Corvettes, Vipers, Lotus, Jaguars, classic cars, or some other expensive car that they are working on or selling.",2
5,"This place is insane! Amazing selection of anything you could possibly want! Fresh coffee bar, gelato, pastries, cheeses, wines, sliced meats, fresh homemade pastas & sauces, I could go on for a while... You need to go here!",2
5,"I finally got my water ice fix this weekend. Well actually, I kind of went twice, ssshh. The chocolate-cherry gelati was seriously orgasmic. Why did it take me until August to finally make it down there??! I will definitely be back a few more times while they are still open for the season. And if you haven't been, GO! I corrupted not one, but two Rita's fans this weekend.",2
4,Good donuts. There was a small selection but it was late afternoon when I came so I don't blame them. Extremely nice staff.,2
3,"I agree with the other sentiments about the food and service at the new location. Have eaten at the old and new, and this one just lacks. I'm curious to hear if they get their mojo back. I really liked them in the previous location.",1
3,We have been going here for three years now on a weekly basis and it is consistently good every time!  Tried almost everything on the menu and haven't had anything bad yet.Patron margaritas are the best!  Chips and salsa are never ending!  Never too crowded and always seated quickly.  Friendly staff remembers us  ;)Update:  place is going downhill now. :(.,1
4,"Second time eating here, I had the classic cheeseburger with sweet potato fries.  Good burger, really good fries.  Service was good.  Atmosphere is upbeat, high-end casual.  Decent noise level for group conversation.  $12 for burger & fries is pricey for the size of this burger.  There are better places for a burger.  Huge selection of beers on tap makes this a great place to hang out and drink with friends though.",2
5,"Great place to watch footy.  I was visiting town for work and needed a place to watch my blues take on barfalona and came across Chatham.  It was a Tuesday so they had $4 Guiness and Black and Tans. Had their fish and chips which was new experience for me. Never had fish that was so soft after being fried, but I really enjoyed it, almost the texture of a donut. Saw my team win and had a great time at this pub.",2
5,"This place has great prices and very unique items. If you are especially into items that re-purpose bones/antlers and like medical instruments this is the place you have been looking for. I have been to almost everyday antique store in Pinellas County and this is probably my favorite. You will see lots of reviews about stores having variety, but most antique places are asking for top dollar or even auction prices (If the reviewer didn't actually buy anything they probably don't know much about prices). This place actually wants to sell items and their prices reflect that. The owner was helpful in locating a particular item and was willing to sell at a great price. If you actually want to buy something this is the place to go. I will be back and can't wait to see more one-of-a-kind items.",2
5,"FINALLY a great pizza in Florida.  If you like thin stone pizza with great flavor, THIS IS the place.  Very impressed and Jenny is a sweetheart at the bar.",2
3,"Stopped here after our first choice had too long of a wait. Nice place; clean and bright. You order at the counter -- oddly, while the specialty pizzas were listed on the menu board, there was no description -- and then sit down to wait. We got a 14"" two topping and two regular drinks, which came about $20. Mind you, this is with paper plates (the chintsy kind, so they brought 4 for the 2 of us) and plastic silverware. The expectation also seemed to be that you bus your own table.The pizza sauce was very bland. My husband ordered jalapenos and the guy did honor my request to go easy on them, which I appreciate. At noon on a Saturday, it wasn't busy at all. Pet peeve: as a non-soccer fan, I don't mind seeing it on TV, but to have it on both TVs with the volume way up was overkill. Because, shocker, guess what? IT WAS A TIE. :-)",1
4,"I really love the book trader. It has so much character. I seems like the quintessential used book store. The staff is cool, the selection is expansive, and they frequently have good deals. Sure, they don't always have the titles you're looking for, but that kind of goes with the territory.I picked up Franzen's The Corrections for $1.87. And even if you can't find anything you want to buy, overlooking 2nd street from the couch upstairs is a great way to spend some time. When i worked in olde city, I spent many lunch breaks in that exact spot.",2
1,Biggest group of Dunkin Donuts idiots I have ever come across in my life!!,0
1,"While I was moving in and had all my stuff on my patio the inspector left a note that was threatening :Stating I had inappropriate items on my patio Trash left out EXCUSE me but I was moving !!!!!!So I went to the office and a woman named Deborah helped me ..Very condescending .. Acted like I had no right to complain about my note...Then I asked for a copy of my lease.. Oops again .... We're sorry you can't have that it's under lock and key!!! WHAT!!!!!This volley of info and rudeness continued until she came out and said they were closing the office for the night!!WOW what a difference from my rental I'm Asheville NC.. Friendly clean always remembered who we were even though it was a huge complex..Ohhh , they will be friendly when you are looking but once you sign the dotted line ....not so great!!!!You're just a number , you mean nothing to SENTINAL CORP believe me or they would have a nicer staff and wouldn't have to threaten you when your trying to get all your stuff put away!!!!",0
5,"Tip: Become a member to see many films for free!I have seen many films at the International House. I can feel they really love film and respect the many mediums of film. Films are usually shown in the original medium in which they were recorded. This makes for a much different experience than watching the films at home. The theater is clean and the seating is stadium seating. They hold film festivals and show many rare and foreign films. I've been here multiple times where they have difficulty starting a film. I'm not sure if that is because of the medium or because they aren't prepared. Anyway, I think Philadelphia is very lucky to have the International House and I suggest becoming a member for free films and special even invites.",2
3,"Single slice is $1 more for a topping and not worth it. But at $3.50 for plain cheese it seems like a good deal. It's not the best pizza ever, but it's good drinking food!12/5 Update- I ate at the original Lorenzo and Sons pizza in Philadelphia and their pizza was much much better. It was no comparison. West Chester makes the pizza too crunchy. I believe it was $4 a slice in Philly.",1
4,"I was really impressed when I went to Nashville Humane. I expected some grubby run down building with nasty old rusty cages full of desperate dogs and cats. What I found instead was a clean, big, new facility. In the lobby, there are the pets of the week, who have a special reduced adoption fee of $35, and that includes spay/neuter and all shots.I went because I was inquiring about their Rover truck, which goes around Nashville and spay/neuters dogs and cats for only $10. I had just been adopted by a tomcat who was trying to make everything in my house his (i.e. peeing all over it). The staff were so helpful and even though they were fully booked up and I had to go elsewhere, they followed up and called me two weeks later when they had a spot.Check out their website for the pets of the week and other listings and services.",2
5,"This is my go-to spot for just about everything from movies to accessories to food.I was in for a mix of them all on this visit. I had to pick up the latest movie on Blu-ray with the digital copy. I have always found Target to be the best place for these. Then I picked up some cute St.Patrick's day cards for my pen pals. I love their stationary selection for all the holidays and special occasions. I buy almost all of my cards here.Finally, it was time to hit the Easter aisle. I was in desperate need of those cadbury mini eggs. I don't know about you but I hoard these to have during the off season and ever since my stash ran out I've been dying for it to be Easter again. The first week of March turned out to be the perfect time for Easter candy to appear! It was my lucky day. Two bags of those and a carton of Russell Stover's milk chocolate marshmallow eggs then I was ready to check out. They make this so easy with plenty of cashiers and they actually like when you use your reusable bags. Yes, I am one of those nuts. I hate plastic bags. Not many stores make it as convenient to use your reusable bags and Target even rewards me for them by gifting me .5cents a bag. It's not much but it is a nice pat on the back for working towards being more environmental friendly. Target gets an A+ for this visit.",2
5,A great little find in Newtown Square. Fantastic food and great service. BYOB which makes it evens better value. Will definitely be back.,2
2,"Just to let you know I'm from Jersey but LOVE to go out to Phila. a lot! So, I was in the city to see HIM and I booked a hotel via Hotwire and they gave me a pretty good deal but the experienced sucked my window was facing another building just garbage when you are looking to see the city lights. The room was nice but nothing to talk about I've been in a quality Inn better than the room they gave me and be sure NOT to touch a thing in the mini fridge!!! Best part about staying there is that my friends and I crashed a wedding that night. Be sure to go on the 33rd floor where you can see the great city of Philadelphia! What a view! but you are seriously better off just taking any other hotel in Phila. Just have fun with it and see what you get you make the experience don't let these big named or expensive rooms do the taking. Be spontaneous!",0
5,"Crawfish mac n cheese = outstanding! Cornbread was awesome, too. Good strong drinks and great service.",2
5,"Had the best experience in this adorable boutique.  Walked in, just looking around and out of the blue I'm being helped and treated like a princess!",2
4,"Fast service.  Pretty good food.  The pizza was fine, though I am not really a fan of the ultra thin crust style pizza typical in St. Louis.The people were friendly, though, and the salads were great.",2
5,"My fiance and I went to this restaurant recently with my sister and her husband. I ordered chicken tacos, wasn't too impressed. Everything else was amazing though. The guacomole was presented beautifully and tasted even better. However, this is not a traditional mexican restaurant. They also need more options. No beef Enchiladas? Cmon!Our server, Shauna, is my reason for the 5 star review. She was very attentive and informative and quick to get us whatever we needed even while we saw her juggling a few other tables. When I gave some of my suggestions she mentioned that the restaurant is working hard to find its niche, and things are constantly improving. Because of her great attitude and service, my family and I will return to Suegra Tequila Cantina.",2
1,"Ok, I hate to give a place one star and I generally don't do it, but after two visits within the past week and both of them being poor, I am left no choice.  On the first visit, an individual in my party (of three people) received their order incorrectly and the kitchen manager was going to fix it.  I believe she then forgot to turn in the order to fix it so everyone was done and the lady still didn't have her corrected order.  Our waitress didn't even return to our table the entire time we were there.  We had to flag down another employee for drink refills.  Second visit... waited...waited...waited... seriously, how long does it take to make a few pizzas, a salad and an app?  Then, we ordered dessert, waited about ten minutes for it.  The employee said ""sorry for your wait"" when he brought us the check and then we continued to wait another ten minutes for him to come back and pick it up.  If you are going to acknowledge our wait, you might not want to make us wait again.  Grr!  We were late getting back to our office from our lunch break.  Probably have to say with certainty that I won't be returning to CPK.  Sorry, because the food is actually not that bad but the service could use serious improvements because they are not even that busy of a place!",0
4,"Competent simple egg dishes, croissants and paninis.  The chef knows what she is doing.  Service is appropriately indifferent for an artsy cafe.  Great music on the sound system.  I'd visit again for a quick bite next time I'm in New Orleans.",2
5,"Went there for a belated birthday dinner with some friends.  I finally know now what all of the noise is about.  This place has come a long way, in decor and in the dining experience.  You're entrance to the bar area is a hint to what is about to occur.  Great lighting, and a nice flow to the dining areas.  We were provided great seating and were immediately engaged in the ordering process.  I couldn't believe how affordable the drinks were priced, and they were a good pour as well.  I ordered from the $20.13 menu, which includes (3) courses.  App, main meal and dessert.  I had the eggplant app and it was simply amazing.  Not greasy, and the perfect amount of cheese and sauce.  I then had the shrimp pasta.  I was a bit disappointed with the size and number of shrimp, but for the cost of the meal - completely understandable.  Finally, the dessert arrives.  We all shared several of them.  The plates were licked clean.  Our server and all the staff did an amazing job.  It's a great place for large groups, as well as, intimate moments.  If you haven't tried it, go for it!",2
2,"I originally gave this place four stars and a great review, but that was because I had only experienced this place one time and now I've changed my mind. I just ordered a pizza from Empire and they said they are currently out of cheese and can't make my one pizza. HTF do you run out of cheese at 6 PM when you're a pizza place? I understand there's a Cardinals game on tonight, but management is supposed to take things like that into consideration when running a pizza business.What's even a bigger joke is the fact they are supposed to be open until midnight tonight. So I guess it's only Italian roast beef sandwiches and cola for anyone who tries walking in for a pizza.  This isn't the only order fail I've had with this place. It's not uncommon for them to not answer the phone or to be out of certain ingredients on a regular basis. There's no point in looking at the menu because you have a 50/50 chance it won't be there. Maybe they need to hire new management who will know how to keep up with the high volume, otherwise I can see this place losing a lot of customers over the next few years and eventually closing just based on the fact it's a gamble when one goes to order their food. Talk about an unsustainable flash in the pan business model that's obvious at it's peak. Too bad it's only down hill from here. (I am writing this review hoping the owner reads it and actually does something about the problem. I'm sick of bottom feeding business owners who don't care). The pizza was good the one time I was able to order it, though. But certainly not worth going through the headache of dealing with them again.  I just ordered Imo's... St. Louis is better than New York anyway.",0
5,Tony's is the most amazing place you've never heard of! My husband and I eat breakfast there every Sunday and it is the perfect spot to make memories. The donuts are amazing and for $5 we're both sufficiently happy! It's the perfect spot for an early morning stop. You're missing out if you don't give it a try.,2
1,"Terrible service. My mother and I got the same exact order and she was charged two dollars more. The waitress danced around our questions before pointing to the bottom of the menu to say prices are subject to change. No wonder they changed their name, probably from all the bad reviews they received prior.",0
5,"The Margaritas were yummy!  And I have never liked Margaritas. Lol. My mom had the regular on the rocks and I had Mango over Paris which consisted of peach snapps, tequila and mango pieces small enough to fit through the straw right into my mouth. Ingenious!!  They were $7.50 and $9.25 roughly each. Well worth it especially since they had a country guitar player there playing older songs. Fun time!",2
4,"This is the coffee spot. I am originally from Seattle and I had yet to find a place that has the true coffee shop atmosphere, and then I went to the blind tiger. The staff is so friendly and helpful and the coffee is expertly prepared. There are always fun events going on and interesting community things happening. The food is decent, but not amazing. Also, the furniture is not the most comfortable. I enjoy going here to grab a cup of coffee and get on with my day.",2
5,This is one of the parks to visit when in the Tucson area and even in the winter the weather was great! It's an easy park to drive to and there's lots of parking at the visitor center. I used my National Park pass to get in for free! There are lot's of hiking areas and an 8 mile loop you can bicycle or drive. It is possible to get lost so watch yourself when wandering the trails. There is a really nice lunch spot for picnics and make sure you bring lots of water. Spring brings lots of blooms so bring your camera and enjoy the great landscapes.,2
4,This is a great space inside and chic looking patio outside. We were greeted immediately and seated at a table for Happy Hour.  They have a small but well curated wine list. We opted for 2 glasses of red wine that paired very well with the short rib tacos and calabacitas tacos. Both were delicious as was the spicy rock shrimp. Don't miss the roasted cauliflower.  It was outstanding.   The service we received from the staff was excellent. We passed on dessert but will definitely be back soon!,2
3,"I ordered from BAP using UberEats, and enjoyed it. The food was warm and delicious, and there was a nice ratio of meat and vegetables to rice. I liked their kimchi as well, which they did manage to keep at a cooler temperature than the bibimbap.",1
5,"I usually don't write yelp reviews but I was so impressed with this urgent care that I wanted to share my experience. I had taken my significant other in because he was vomiting. The staff from the check in desk, to the MA's were extremely friendly and welcoming. The NP Kendra is absolutely amazing and diagnosed my boyfriend right away and gave him an IV. She then called him two days later to check on him. He still wasn't feeling well today so he called in and was able to speak directly to Kendra with no hassle. The service this facility provides is excellent and extremely hard to find elsewhere. I highly recommend this location!",2
4,"I attended the #welldoneTBO tweet-up at Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza last week and had a great time. The folks at Anthony's were amazing with the customer service. We got to try so many menu items, and all were amazing. The Philly Cheesesteak Pizza was my 10 year old's favorite. I loved the Cauliflower pizza...so buttery and garlicky and delicious (vegetarian). We also got to try the carmelized onion-smothered wings which were out of this world. Also tasted: meatballs, ribs, salad...all very good. We ordered off the menu a half and half pizza with pepperoni, sausage and mushrooms. So good. If they had liquor on the menu I would have given them five stars (I'm just not a beer or wine person). Thanks for a great evening Anthony's! We'll be back.",2
5,"My new kitchen looks awesome.  Thanks, Maria for the attention to detail in the design - the counters, cabinets, back-splash, flooring and hardware all go great with my appliances and with each other.  Donald did a fabulous job installing the cabinets, etc. Always pleasant, on time, and very particular about details and getting it right the first time.  I highly recommend this business!!!",2
4,"Other than the beds not being very comfortable, I loved staying at this hotel! The views of the harbor were beautiful and the location of the hotel is perfect. It is right across the street from the pier and a very short walking distance to all the restaurants and shops. A continental breakfast is served every morning from 7-10am and there is a rooftop bar on the 10th floor. The view at the bar is worth sitting there for a drink, but other than that the drinks were not very good and the food is nothing special.",2
1,"I had a bad experience here a few years ago. We came for a valentine's dinner, and made reservations a month in advance. When we got there, even though we had a reservation, we waited over 30 minutes. We were eventually seated right next to their back door entrance, which people entered and exited through the whole night. It was snowing out, and every time that door opened, a blast of cold air hit our table. It was not pleasant, and when we asked to move we were told there was no where to move us to. On top of all that, the food was lousy and way overpriced.",0

4,Beautiful old theater that puts on excellent performances!,2
5,"What a great hotel! I am a loyal Hyatt customer and this property did not disappoint. There was only one thing that stood out as odd - it cost $26 to valet park your car, but they refused to bring you the car when you left? But, in typical Hyatt fashion, they made it all right by refunding the parking charge. The best night of sleep we had at any hotel. Good times!",2
1,First know that the shop works by appointment only.   Don't find out the hard way like I did.  Even though I arrived while Jack was there he told me both that he closes at 5 and works by appointment only.  I guess he has more customers than he needs.  I won't be one of them.,0
5,Dealing with this dealership was a pleasure - from the sales staff member I worked with (Sean Morris) through the sales leadership and ownership.  Sean was attentive to my needs and personal direction.  All dealership employees always helped resolve issues to resolution in a professional manner.  I would purchase from Pacifico again in the future!,2
3,"The hubby and I started off with the supreme nacho and they were pretty yummy! Make sure to add the spicy beef! The husband ordered a 10"" pizza with sausage, pepperoni, bacon, and ham and I ordered the burger with cheese, mayo, provolone cheese, and BBQ sauce. My husband gave the pizza a 7 out of 10 and my burger was just above average. It satisfied my burger craving so that's a plus!",1
1,Had to wait over 2 hours for food! Delivery drivers don't know their way around and can't seem to knock on a door. This store is pathetic. I will NEVER order from this location again.,0
4,"This place is a great spot for girlfriends or for a lunch or dinner date with your plus one. I met up one of my girlfriends to grab some dinner this past Wednesday night and my experience at this Webster Groves location was pretty much perfect. I have been to the Clayton location numerous of times and enjoyed it thus I decide to try this one out. We ended up sitting outside on their patio since it was so nice outside and we both ended up getting their salads as our main entree. My friend ordered their main house salad while I ordered their large Greek salad. It was your typical Greek salad with olives and feta but their dressing was quite tangy, which I liked a lot. I will definitely come back to this location!",2
4,Stopped in for a drink. Loud and outgoing environment. The waitress Amanda was attentive and served with a smile. I ordered the Avocado Fritas which were flavorful and fried well.,2
5,"I've been here many times and have eaten at nearly every sushi place in and around Indy. This place is my favorite. I have a personal preference for fruit in my roll and Sushi Bar has the most options. The Spicy Girl is my favorite roll anywhere in Indy. I never thought I'd like pineapple in my roll, but it really surprised me. The Volcano Roll and American Dream Roll are very good as well. This is the first 5-star I've given on Yelp.",2
5,"We took a trip to New Orleans for spring break/my son's 11th birthday.  One of our excursions was the Swamp Tour, our guide was Capt. Troy.    Please please please take this tour.  When I say it was awesome, that is an understatement.  Capt. Troy provided us with a wealth of information.  He was very patient and answered every question that was asked.  I am  a Swamp People (the reality show) fan and I learned stuff that was totally different than the show....oh AND we were on Honey Island, how cool is that. If you take a trip to the Bayou make sure you book a swamp tour through Cajun Encounters, you will NOT be disappointed from beginning to end.",2
5,Really clean super cute cafe. Very friendly & the Caprese sandwich is amazing. So glad I found this gem :),2
3,"M.L. Rose is a good place to throw a few beers back with dinner with friends with their large tables.  Their burgers are good but overpriced by at least 20%.  Why pay more for a burger here over the pharmacy or Burger Republic for more $$$ ?  They do have some TV's for sports too, but it's not the end all be all sports bar.  Overall not a bad place as they can cater to any crowd.",1
5,"Yummy takoyaki! Finally I found a Japanese restaurant in Philadelphia area that isn't a sushi / tempura joint!Went there last Saturday, ordered 2 type of tako balls. Original and BBQ flavor. Both in octopus.. since the real takoyaki supposed to be only using octopus as its' meat. But they have other choices of meat in case you don't eat octopus. Like chicken, beef and such.1 order of takoyaki consist of 6 balls, cost around $5. Both are very yummy, though I like the original more.I will definitely go back for more and try on their Yakisoba.Make sure you put one hour on your parking meter if you order more than just one kind. It took 20 minutes for 2 orders of different flavor takoyaki.I didn't see the problem with super heavy dough or some sort which encountered by other yelpers though. I think everything just perfect!",2
3,"There is really nothing to write home about on this one.  I do have one complaint- when we checked in on Friday night we asked about upgrading to a room with a jacuzzi, and there were none available, but we were told that we could upgrade the following night for $30.  When I went to the front desk the next morning to complete the upgrade, I was told it would be $80.  There was no explanation as to why I was quoted two totally different amounts.But the room was decent.  Definitely clean.  The decor left a lot to be desired unless you like cheap victorian/renaissance/old-school type stuff.  I can't believe they paid someone for the fake hideous artwork in the place.Our room had an awesome view of the trash area, and we had to go up a floor, walk down the skywalk, then down a floor and back to our room.  Not a big deal for us, but if you are elderly or disabled or anything it would be a pain in the ass I'm sure.Gosh, I sure sound like negative nancy.  Don't let me deter you, but just don't expect the best.",1
5,"Burger Up is one of my favorite restaurants in Nashville.  While in college, I visited the one in 12th South pretty often.  Now that I live in Franklin, I go to the one in Cool Springs.  Same great food as 12 south but with more seating and less of a wait, yes please! The burgers are definitely one of my top favorite burgers. I get the one topped with pimento cheese, but I have tried a good bit of them.  All are amazing. The truffle fries are out of this world and their garlic aioli is absolutely delicious. Definitely one of my favorite meals in Nashville.  I even recommended it on my wedding website to guests from out of town to try.",2
1,"This is the worst take out I've had.  All I wanted was a large salad tonight and I'm so mad I just wasted $20.  I tied ordering a taco salad and when I asked the girl for an add on of chicken, she said no. Not it will be an extra 2 or 3 dollars (which I would have happily paid) but just a no we won't do it.  I changed my order to the Udon Noodle Salad.  I was then told it would be 45 min-1 hour.  It was an hour and a half+ before I got my order. I was looking forward to a large arugula salad with chicken and the other items, instead I got a small bowl of cold noodles with a little arugula and cold chicken. It was awful and a waste of money.  I ordered sweet potato fries on the side and they would have been decent had they not been freezing cold.Don't waste your money!",0
4,"No unreasonable waits, great service, and their food is a decent local alternative to Italian chains.  Do not go to the other two Gavi's!  You will be disappointed.",2
1,"The worst We stayed at the hotel and went to the very empty bar that first night.My cousin got married the second night and the **very large** manager?? wouldn't let my wife upstairs --too much to drink? But she let up every heifer in the club,but my wife on a Friday night--No way!! So if  you are any amount of decent looking good luck you're not getting in--This place was a joke--my wife wasn't allowed in but every heavy lady that the manager knew had no problem getting in. Good luck. This place is a joke.",0
2,"Two stars for let's see...location--right in the middle of the Gulch, next to great restaurants, and the fact that it's pretty obscure and for some reason I think that's cool (look at the picture--just a building, no real sign except for a very small one that you can't even see that just has dots on it).  Like Rahel, maybe I'm too old for this place.  I don't even know what type of crowd usually goes here though.  Just know it's not my crowd.  Now, I've been here once and had a great time--that was several years ago, before they completely redid the upstairs (it's VIP only now apparently) and you could have private parties up there on this catwalk-style loft overlooking the bar.  THAT was pretty cool.  I attended one of those parties and that's when I had fun.  Alas, those days are over though.Let's get right down to it:Cons: Expensive drinks ($10 for a shot of vodka and soda?), loud thumping music to where you can't even talk to anyone, it's a little more than cheesy, and there is a NYC-style ""bouncer"" at the door--complete with velvet ropes--that makes you wait in line even if it's not crowded inside.  Ridiculous, this is Nashville.  Pros:It's right next to Watermark and Sambuca, so if you are eating there and want an after-dinner cocktail in a totally different atmosphere, it's just steps away.  Also right next door to City Hall (music venue), and often if there is a concert there Bar Twenty 3 will have some sort of special in connection with it.  It's a totally different type of bar scene than most of Nashville offers, so when you are tired of the same ole' same ole' this could be for you.  Just be prepared to ""dress to impress"" (that was actually on their door once) and pay a lot to drink.",0
1,"Would never come back to this Quiznos again. We showed up at 10:50am on Sunday and sign says doesn't open till 11am, which i can respect so I waited in my car till 11am and then I go to the door and the lights are still out and it appears that an employee had just arrived and she is giving my wife and I the one minute signal through the window. We stand outside and wait, mind you it's winter and cold. We wait a couple minutes outside and then a second employee arrived and says to us ""it's not open yet""? The  employee inside lets the other one in and proceeds to tell us to wait longer in which it is 11:05 at this time and none of the veggies and sandwich meat had been out so we decided to go somewhere else. They could have at least allowed us to wait inside. Clearly punctuality is not important to the employees of this store.",0
5,By far the best brunch in Tucson. One of the rare places that serves a Bloody Mary with a beer back.  Service is consistently great. Expect a wait Friday-Sunday. Order the Benedict and the Madras mimosa.,2
1,This theater seriously needs to check on the customers. I've been here three times the past 6 months and I'm fed up. I'm never coming again. I'm always in a theater with someone that doesn't know the true meaning of a whisper. So now I'm subject to know why this teen can't be out to late and I have to keep my rage caged or risk going to jail for beating the crap out of some imbecile who doesn't have manners.,0
2,The Cuban sandwich was good and the place is clean but the price was a bit high for what we got. They need to offer fries with their sandwiches. People don't expect to pay extra nowadays. The salad bar was not worth the money and come on what salad bar don't have bacon bits or croutons? Simply terrible. The waitress acted like she was doing a favor just serving us. She was grumpy and slow and had a poor attitude when asked about the food. I would not recommend coming here not with the fabulous Whistle Stop dinner just down the street. Highly disappointing.,0
5,Lovely place in a fun neighborhood!  Great burger and fries served with a smile!  Can't wait to go back!,2
5,"My profe introduced me to this place. You have to get the fried fish tacos. they are the best, first time was the best time. A Mexican Taco without cheese.",2
4,Good food and friendly service! I love that they had lots of healthy options. My friend had veggie sausage - she said it was so good she wondered if it was really veggie! Lol. Great service from cute waiters!  It was worth the wait on a crowded Saturday morning.,2
4,Really chill atmosphere. Had the special sandwich for lunch which was delicious. Fiancé had a couple of good beers. Bartender was super friendly.,2
2,"The service was good and the staff was polite, but the food was bland and lacked flavor. The drinks were ok about what you would expect of a chain restaurant. If you are looking for somewhere to sit Down for a quick lunch this might be your place.",0
5,Overall great experience. I am new to the area and have been looking for a full service car wash--this will be my go to place from now on. The staff here is friendly and did a great job on both my exterior wash and interior detail. My car looks and smells brand new.,2
3,"Popped in to get gas in the work vehicle today and that was the most confusing fleet card experience I have ever had in my life.  I'm still confused as to why it was so confusing.Anyhoo, this location has a car wash, fuel, as well as a fairly big snack/drink section for a Hughes.I'm sure I'll be seeing you again Hughes :-)",1
5,We wouldn't go anywhere else on the Main Line but JOHN's. The best sandwiches in the area. They fresh cut their Deli meats and use really great bread for all their sandwiches. Their pork sandwich with sharp provolone is to die for. They have other locations but are not a chain and you can tell by the way they treat their customers that they are a family run business that cares about serving quality foods.,2
5,"This place is UNTOUCHABLE if you want a great environment to enjoy the best sushi in PA. They are clean, very quick with service and just impeccable. I have been all over the area and this is the one I continue to come back to. The outdoor seating is wonderful and there is an area that is under a roof so you can enjoy the outdoors even if the weather is a bit dreary. And the one thing that amazes me is no matter how full the parking lot seems they WITHOUT FAIL are extremely speedy no matter how many customers they have. I wish I could give more than 5 stars.  TOP NOTCH!",2
2,"I'm Peruvian, I went to this place a couple times and always it's the same....the pollo a la brasa is always way too dry and never fresh. The green rice is too greasy, I found a lot of oil underneath and it's gross. Other places have so much better food than this. They should check the food before served, like making sure the rice isn't so greasy and that the chicken is served right off the grill, not super dry like it's been sitting around for hours.",0
1,"Walked in on a quiet Wednesday night, where only three other tables were occupied.  We should've walked out right then and there, but we figured it was just a mid-week lull.This is not an exaggeration, but FIVE MINUTES after we ordered, our food came out.  At least they could've *pretended* they were cooking our food to order, rather than simply reheating leftovers.Our dish of complimentary cornbread was bone-dry.  Perhaps it had been drenched in honey butter a day or two prior, but it certainly hadn't seen any moisture that day.Our gumbo was cold on top but piping hot on the bottom, so we mixed up the bowl to get a lukewarm appetizer.Based on other Yelpers' reviews about the ""tough"" creole rabbit, Olivier's preys on people who have never eaten rabbit before.  We've cooked numerous rabbit dishes at home and know how tender it can be.  Again, the rabbit might've been tender at some point, but it was certainly not cooked fresh that day.  It was also cold to the touch, and the accompanying rice pilaf was super dry.All told, we were seated, ordered, fed, paid, and out the door in 35 minutes.Another minus:  Olivier's website shows the creole rabbit priced at $22.95, so you're ready to spend $20ish, but once you're in the restaurant, it's $27.95 and you're spending almost $30 for a reheated plate of mediocre food.The only plus is that the waitress was super nice and made us feel right at home.That wasn't enough to save the experience, though.  I expect to see Olivier's on Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares soon.",0
1,We never bothered going because the staff was so rude when we called to ask a few questions that we wound up hanging up on them.,0
5,The 5 stars are well earned!  Gabrieal is awesome and helped me get tires for my RV and now has fixed my 1993 4Runner.  I will always go to these guys for anything i need on my cars.,2
3,"Came for Sunday brunch, ate outside- cute ambiance. Server was friendly and food was good. Not mind blowing, but I'd gladly go back.",1
5,"Just had our Wedding here Saturday November 3rd at the Singleton Pavilion - was absolutely perfect. We booked an ""off season"" wedding (Nov-Feb) so got the venue for about 1/4 the normal cost, the view was just amazing. Lush beautiful trees and well kept lawns made for the perfect day. They had grounds keepers there the morning of to clean the restrooms and clean the grounds, also had parking attendants there to guide our guests to our venue. If you do book Singleton versus their much larger venue Godric Grove the only major downside is the parking situation - you're guests have to walk quite a ways to get to your venue. And, besides electrical outlets and a sink - its pretty bare. No lighting anywhere so you need to be prepared to have all of the basic things covered. The staff was perfect with communication during the booking process and called to confirm everything 1 week prior. Very, very happy with this venue. Absolutely gorgeous!",2
5,"They had me at the copper bunny...vodka, pineapple jalapeño tequila, lime juice and sparkling wine in a beautiful copper bunny (it packs a wallop). Don't try to find one to buy...they mold and make them just for the restaurant.Starters included fresh chilled gulf oysters and crispy conch fritters with pineapple tarter sauce.  We then proceeded to two tuna ""small bites:"" sushi grade hamachi lightly tossed with a guava curry and papaya, and more traditional tuna tartare...they couldn't have been better.  We were a little scared to try the curried goat but it wasincredibly tender and the curry paired perfectly with the melt-in-your-mouth sweet potato gnocchi.  No room for dessert but we can't wait to come back to NOLA and Compère Lapin!",2
5,"Get the TACOS! Tex Mex style. Always fresh, always tasty. Staff are friendly and you can basically get food any time of day or night!",2
1,Was excited for some good food until I actually tried it. Nothing was fresh. Had gumbo and fried shrimp. You can tell it was old. No real flavor. The mac and cheese to my surprise wasn't good either. Old and flavorless. Would not recommend at all.,0
1,I went to El Camino on a Sunday afternoon for a late lunch. When I got there we had to wait for a table so me and my date grabbed drinks from the bar. We ordered a pitcher of margarita. The bartender came back to check on us and she couldn't hear me and flipped her head to the side and her hair landed in the pitcher. She said she was going to make another one. She pretended to throw out the liquid in the pitcher and make another one . Instead she walked over to the other bar and just added ice to the pitcher her hair landed in .That was strike one of the afternoon. Then when we were finally seated I ordered the pancho nachos with chicken. They brought it out without the chicken. I tell the waiter. Instead of bring out a fresh nacho they bring out the chicken in a bowl. Service is poor and the quality of goods is not great either. I used to like coming here but know I most likely won't be back again as the standards in customer service and quality of food and drinks has significantly decreased.,0
5,Great beer and service! The servers have to take a course on all the beers so they know a lot about what they have to offer! They do take reservations so I would recommend that.,2
5,"i eat at kabob n grill once or twice a week for months now...every single time the restaurant is perfectly clean n the food is always perfect too...every one i have sent there also seems to become a lifetime customer...things are done on a very high level at kabob n grill...i am very fussy n the food i eat is very important to me...it's got to taste great, but it has to be prepared with a very strict n high standard...i have found my extravagantly excellent restaurant in kabob.....i am a mainline business owner 25 years",2
5,Very helpful and friendly people working here. I needed a car after someone crashed into my car and I requested a specific type of car which they worked really hard to make sure was waiting for me when I got there. Very happy with my experience.,2
4,"Excellent happy hour. Half off pizza and dollar off beers and cocktails from 4-8. Service was very good and so friendly. 90% of food is made in.horse, rest is locally sourced. And you can tell.Me and my friend sat at the bar for 3 hours. Music was great too. I will be returning!",2
5,Best Indian food I have had in Tucson! Veggie samosas were delicious and the curry is to die for. This is definitely a hidden gem!,2
5,"Delicious!  Came here with my family and they accommodated a large group of us last minute.  Great food, very authentic Taiwanese cuisine.  We had the 3 cup chicken, pan fried seafood noodles, soup dumplings, string beans, some sort of greens with garlic sauce which were outstanding, soup dumplings, scallion pancakes ... all were delicious and authentic according to my brothers Taiwanese girlfriend.",2
3,"It's ok, nothing great.  Prices are reasonable.  I didn't care for their sauce, too thin and watery.  Meat inside raviolis tasted a bit off to me.  My gf's alfredo was good.  Portions are fairly large so you're not going to go away hungry.",1
5,"Great location, close to all the ""tourist-y"" stuff.  Hotel is beautiful!  You can walk to everything including the Arch and Busch Stadium.  Close to dining.  Felt safe there and the staff was excellent!!",2
5,This place had AMAZING food. I loved everything about the presentation of the food to the eating of it :-) I WILL be returning!,2
3,"I stopped in here Friday evening with my boyfriend Dan. It was chilly out and we wanted something hot to warm our empty bellies. My first impression of this place was that it was oddly set up. The drink station was pushed back into a corner and the food prep area seemed bigger than it needed to be. The restaurant appeared to be very clean and the staff was friendly. We ordered two grinder combos. I had the spicy chicken and Dan had the chicken cordon bleu. Both combos came with a medium drink and a bag of chips. I think our total was around $16. After we ordered, we were told to have a seat and our food would be brought out to us. We grabbed our drinks and some chips and waited somewhere between 8-10 minutes before we received our grinders. This annoyed me a bit, but it was probably because I was so hungry. Well my annoyance quickly disappeared when I took the first bite. Our grinders were hot, the cheese was melt-y and the flavors were great. This was much better than and ""toasted"" sub at Subway or Quiznos. I will definitely be back!",1
5,"Then Comes Baby is an incredible resource and was life-saving for lactation consultation. We first encountered TCB/Sabrina for a lactation class. Before even signing up for the prenatal class, I spoke with Sabrina on the phone. She was incredibly helpful, getting me resources for doulas and advice about how to obtain support through the whole birth process. We signed up for the prenatal series but were only able to make it to the breastfeeding class b/c our son came early. The class was great and I can only assume that the rest of the prenatal class would have been just as good. Sabrina helped put me in touch with an inpatient nurse at UCSF where we were going to deliver to discuss the possibility for pre-expressed breast milk if my baby was to need supplementation, etc. She went out of her way to get us the help that we needed. But, then the real magic started with her assistance. I ended up having severe preeclampsia and delivering my baby a month early. We were having trouble with breastfeeding in the hospital and I sent Sabrina an email which she replied to and offered her assistance, along with advice and help obtaining a hospital grade pump. She then came over to our home the day after we were home from the hospital. From that day forward, she was available weekly at my house and by email and phone. We had a particularly difficult time with breastfeeding. My baby boy was  a month early, had totricollis, and was tongue tied. Sabrina walked us through all of this and helped us at every step of the way, from softly suggesting a dentist to release his tongue and lip tie, to urging us to get cranio-sacral work on a weekly basis, to lending us a scale to weigh our boy. For two months, he would not breast feed and then he learned to latch! Sabrina was still by my side teaching me how to transition from my comfort zone of measuring out all of his ounces to trusting that he was getting enough directly from my breast. My baby boy never went hungry the whole time he was learning and never needed supplementation beyond my breastmilk. Some of the most important things that are special about Sabrina is that she supported what I wanted, but she was also clear about getting nutition to my baby. Lots of moms who have trouble with breastfeeding and who desire to exclusively breast feed, run into the problem of under-feeding their baby, which causes problems in the long run that are much worse than supplementing with formula. Sabrina watched the growth of our baby boy closely to make sure that he was always getting enough and made sure that my supply was developed well so that I always produced enough. The second thing that is special about Sabrina is that she is a LC who supports whatever mom's want. She alters her plans according to family wishes. She also was very cognizant of my emotional state and making sure that I was taking care of myself. This is really important because it is difficult to want to breastfeed and to have to pump and bottle feed while trying to teach your baby to latch. It takes about 20 hours/day and is painful work when he/she is not able to latch. Sabrina kept checking in with me to make sure that I was still emotionally holding up. In the end, it worked out for me. He is now exclusively breastfed and we were even able to travel to Maui for 5 days where he breastfed on the beach and at waterfalls. It was glorious and everything I ever hoped for in a breastfeeding relationship with my son. I am now transitioning to work and Sabrina has been there as a support through phone consultation. As a physician, I think it is incredibly important to have this kind of support. I only wish that our health insurance--public and private--supported this kind of consultation because for some cases, like mine, it was absolutely necessary, and Sabrina and TCB were there every step of the way. I cannot more highly recommend them.",2
1,"I'll start this off by saying I've worked in the food industry as a server, bartender, expo, busser, dishwasher, etc for 10 plus years. I now work with disabled persons trying to help them find employment. We're not supposed to meet them in their home as per company policy. My client, who is disabled, and I have visited this pizzeria a few times per her request because it's close to her house and she feels comfortable meeting there. Today we went in at 1:45pm and I noticed it was busier than usual (typically we go at a time where it is not busy restaurant hours.) Before going to sit down like we normally do, and again this was only our third time here, We were greeted aggressively and immediately by who I assume is the owner. I started to ask ""do you mind if we sit here.."" and was cut off. He said, ""I have a real problem with you coming in here not buying anything and sitting taking up a table for 2-3 hours."" (Mind you, we have never been there the previous 2 times over an hour and 15 minutes - as I have a limited amount of time I am able to work with each client.  There also has been about 15 other open tables in the restaurant each time we were there, including today.) This person responded very hostile and aggressive. Had the gentleman asked politely if I purchased a drink or a slice of pizza we could sit and go about our business, however he met me with an extremely volatile attitude and aggressive choice of words. Again, as someone who's worked in the food industry, I understand how it can be frustrating for someone to come in and sit without purchasing anything. With that said, how this employee decided to treat me in this moment made me and my disabled client extremely uncomfortable. The rudeness was completely unnecessary and being familiar with the industry I wouldn't have minded at all purchasing something from this place in order to sit there for an hour, had I been spoken to appropriately. The part I feel the worst about is how my client was treated. I had to explain to her why ""that man was so rude"". It's unacceptable how me and my client were made to feel today. She's already treated differently in the world and she felt terrible after this interaction. I'm mortified that this had to happen in this way, and this whole situation could have been completely avoided had we been treated like human beings. What the employee was trying to say was completely justified, however we were yelled at and made to feel like we were unwelcome for no reason whatsoever. I will not be entering this restaurant again for obvious reasons, and I encourage anyone who has any empathy for disabled persons to do the same. Again, the way we were treated was completely reprehensible and could have been avoided completely.",0
5,Been eating here since the beginning. Best Sonoran dog in town hands down. The comp is overrated and his buns and ingredients aren't as fresh. Their carne is also good and i also mess w a caramelo from time to time. There is a reason rachel ray said they the second best hot dogs in the U.S.,2
5,"How have I never given a review to what's got to be my FAVORITE pizza joint in town?! I've been coming here for delicious pizza since I was a kiddo, and while the owners may have changed, the pizza hasn't. This pizza is a thinner crust than other pizzas, and their chicken wings are just what chicken wings should be: tossed in delicious sauce (mild, medium or hot) and not too crunchy. They have all the favorite pizza: pepperoni, combo, Hawaiian...this is not a fancy place, but it's a place where you'll get some good food. The guys that run it now are all Hispanic, and they have kept this place as good as the previous owners. We come here often enough that they recognize our order (medium 1/2 pepperoni 1/2 veggie with Canadian bacon, 1 pound of mild chicken wings and an order of garlic bread) every time. I plan on continuing to frequent this place for a long time.",2
2,Basic donuts with strange names. Save your self the time and money and just to Snhuncks or better yet Worlds Fair donuts.,0
5,Let me start by saying that the food here is by far the best Mexican I have had in St Pete.  It's nothing fancy and very small but if your looking for some good food and a beer this is the place to go to. Weekend nights do get a little hectic so I would recommend going on a weekday night or during the day so you can skip the long wait to place your order. For the meat lovers out there you can't go wrong with a chorizo taco and for the seafood junkies the fish tacos are amazing!,2
4,Nice new burger spot downtown! They are apart of the harry & izzys chain. The burgers are pretty good. You do have to order a side separately which kinda sticks but seems to be a trend these days. They take reservations so that's always a plus. If you are looking for additional options besides a burger might not be your best spot to go. I'd like to see them do a lunch special during the week for those that go during the work day. I think it would help with costs and getting a bigger lunch crowd. Overall great experience and service. Check them out!,2
4,"Tom was good,  returning calls promptly. The movers arrived crisply on time,  and in good spirits. Malik and Andrew (the moving men) were awesome! I was moving from a 4th floor to a third floor about a dozen blocks apart... I was very organized but I was still happily surprised when the entire move from point A to point B took 47 minutes! Wow! Yes I would highly recommend Sultans of Schlep.",2
5,Great cheesesteak! Friendly and fast service. Lazo's really made my day.,2
5,"Went here again after a long absence (why we took so long to go here again, I have nc). The food here is absolutely fantastic. This is truly a gem in Fairmount. Try to wait for the outdoor seating, if weather permits.. great ppl watching as you dine, sipping your wine (its a BYOB, so bring some).The food is fast, Greek - Mediterranean and done very well.We had Kabobs, Cold Platter, and vegetarian stuffed peppers.. everything was phenomenal, and we couldnt stop talking about how pleased we were with the service, food, ambiance, everything. Make a reservation now.. or stop by.. you wont regret it.",2
5,"I never ever post reviews but this place definitely wowed me. The ac in my car was out and after being priced from other competitors in the 1300-1800 dollar range i came to midas. Not only did the fix it for about 500 bucks cheaper, but they refused to let me take a taxi and one of the mechanics gave me a ride home while I wait for the work to be done. The manager Blake was very professional and helpful. Not once did i feel he was trying to upcharge me for maintenance i didn't need. Someone from corporate needs to give this man a raise so he stays in the company for a very long time!",2
4,"Had three things here, they were all excellent. The buffalo chicken cheesteak, the veggie wings and the margaritas.Definitely going there again.",2
5,"Very nice, quiet and dark restaurant. Chinese and sushi offered. Had szechuan chicken, hot and sour soup, and steamed rice. Hubbie had the prime rib and shrimp hot pot. Just the right amount of food. Didn't have to take any home. Service was excellent.",2
5,"After reading the mixed reviews I had my doubts but have to say our group of 5 was pleasantly surprised! We had made reservations, were seated promptly after a warm greeting at the door as we arrived.  Our group ordered 2 bottles of wine, both half price. I had a Chilean Syrah and found it to be very good.  It's rare to find a special like that for a decent wine, and even more rare on a Friday night!Our meals included pizza, salad, pasta. All prepared perfectly and quite tasty. Our server was friendly and efficient.  I plan to return!",2
5,The service was wonderful - the barista was pleasant and greeted me right away when I walked in. I tried the ham and cheese croissant - it was delicious! I also love the variety of drinks available. A great experience for sure!,2
4,"Great food and sweets are out of this world! Snapper is just Old World, Cook whole and super tasty. Service is great too. One star less for cleanliness, Bathrooms need some major scribing and remodeling. I hate to see kitchen , hahaha!",2
1,Its unfortunate that this restaurant has to hire such terrible people... The delivery driver was one of the rudest people I have ever encountered. My girlfriend placed the order but was indisposed at the time of the initial delivery call that happened at 4:25 pm and I answered the subsequent call 5 minutes later to be harassed and yelled at by the delivery driver for not answering the call. I apologized but he continued to yell at me on the phone. When I went down to pick up my food he continued to harass me outside of my apartment and yell at me after he gave me the food. I wish we hadn't already tipped him on grubhub or else he would have received zero dollars.,0
5,"Great community vibe... i've run into friends and struck up conversation with new ones each time i've been in.  Its nice to have new hang within walking distance of my house.  I've stuck to the classic burger and love it... everything from the buns to the ketchup is made in-house and has unique taste. The bar had pretty much whatever i wanted... last night the bartenders made some homespun watermelon concoction.To touch on some other reviews... i understand everyone has a different experience, but to say the place is 'too hipster' seems like someones still jaded from feeling left out in high school...  and personally attacking the owner is tasteless and has no place in a review.  We should be glad we don't all have someone looking over our shoulder attacking our motives. I like what Burger Up is trying to do and i like that they hired a bunch of folks representative of our Nashville community... if you need a non-musician wait staff who dresses just like you and takes you to prom, you're probably in the wrong town.",2
4,"Got into Santa Barbara and went here for some drinks. Was a little disappointed they close so early, so we didn't get a chance to order any flights of beer or wine but did get to have beer from the bottle which wasn't bad. Would love to come back here earlier in time to taste everything else on their menu",2
1,"DON'T BOTHER GETTING THE GROUPON. The sushi was terrible and they DIDN'T HONOR the Groupon because I didn't present it when I was seated. I've used many, many Groupons in other establishments and have never been refused. I called Groupon and got a refund from them and reported that Yakuza did not accept it.BIG THUMBS DOWN for Yakuza, thumbs up for Groupon.",0
2,"Remember when the teacher graded tests on a scale because no one did well?Pizza in Delaware County needs to be graded that way. If you don't feel like driving into the city to get a Gennaros Tomatoe Pie ,Beddia ,Nomad, SLiCe or any of the other pies that have elevated our pizza game in Philly, you need to temper your expectations when you stay locally. Double Decker supply's the Ridley Wrestling Boosters the slices they sell at each home match. Typical of most Booster slices, they are usually more to the colder side. It never tasted that bad so I thought I'd try a hot, fresh, out-of-the-oven pie at their beautiful new location in Media.This spacious shop has two floors for you to eat your food, ice cold beer to drink there or take out and a large kitchen well staffed to handle your order. I tried the small personal pan size plain pie and the 5 hot buffalo wing sampler. Had a diet Dr Pepper to drink. The verdict? The pizza had a light crust although it was far from crispy. More to a thicker Greek crust of which I'm not a fan. The three cheeses were ok. The sauce tasted like it came out of a can.  The wings were ok. Not horrible. Not great. I wanted them to the well side but these didn't come that way. Included was three pieces of celery and ranch dressing. Reminded me of New London in Prospect Park in that the pizza was cooked in a pan and they also use a blend of cheeses.But overall I prefer New London much more. Don't think I'll be back. Next time, I just make the drive to New London or seek out somewhere I haven't been that my favorite Yelpers give good grades to.",0
4,"We had a very nice dinner here on St. Patrick's day, which happens to be my sister's birthday.  The server was super sweet and served the cake we brought to celebrate.  The bartender was so kind and gave my sister a complimentary St. Patty's cocktail, which was incredibly yummy.  We ordered various dishes:  tri-tip, rotisserie chicken, pulled pork and a veggie burrito.  All was wonderful, except for the veggie burrito, which was lackluster (but who orders a veggie burrito at a rotisserie grill???).  My father-in-law has visited many more times, raving about the moist, flavorful rotisserie chicken.  The prices were reasonable, portions adequate and service super!  We will definitely visit again, minus the resident vegetarian.  :)",2
5,I've been to Gilley's many times and love how they have it set up. You could get lost in there which I did trying to find my way out. Haha if you come to Gilley's give yourself a few hours it's big and lots to see and buy. They even have a flea market outside on certain days.  You'll love this store mark my words.,2

5,"We have eaten at Dolce Vita on several occasions and each time the food was exceptional!!!  We have since had our sons rehearsal dinner there and Frank and his wonderful wife (and chef) could not have been nicer and more accommodating.  The food was out of this world and they allowed us to bring in our own alcohol which kept the price so reasonable.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants a great meal at a reasonable price in a homey and friendly atmosphere. Can't wait to return for dinner.  It is our new go to place with all our friends!,",2
5,"They have a surprisingly good ahi poke here made fresh every morning. And if you want them to make a spicy ahi just call in the morning so they can make a spicy batch of tuna. They also have a great organic fruit and vegetable selection that'll keep me coming back here. Their staff is super friendly and always willing to help. They even have that cool amazon locker grocery system here. I'm way too indecisive to order my groceries online, but it's a good think to keep in mind when wanting to shop here.  I can see it coming in handy if you just need to grab groceries on a jiffy. Just pay in advanced and type in your locker code. Their prices are very reasonable here for their quality of goods. I would definitely recommend this grocery store.",2
3,"For some reason I end up at this Wal Mart when they first open around 6:30. As I enter the employees are still stocking shelves and arriving for work. I head to the water section and pick up a case for work and head to the only check out that is open. This whole process only takes about 10 minutes. This seems to be the best time to shop at Wal Mart, otherwise it it jam packed with people.One note; every time I go to this Wal Mart, the employees stare at me while I go to get my water. It is if I am an Alien sent to observe the Wal Mart workers. My guess is I am the only person crazy enough to go water shopping at 6:30 in the morning.",1

2,"My first time trying Indian. I would say my neutral rating is due to the service. The waitress didn't introduce herself or any specials and didn't  explain the menu it was just a ""what do you want."" We guessed and picked a few things, they were good. Then when the bill came she put it on the table and in under a minute came back and picked it up before we even looked at it. Waitress then said ""how are you paying"" I felt awkward because we hadn't pick it up and it was a first date and she put the bill in front of me. I was hoping my date would be chivalrous, and he was but it was uncomfortable with the waitress coming back picking it up and seeing we didn't put a card in the book yet , because we weren't ready and she kept putting the bill back down, in front of me! This happened about three times. In my prior service experience you put the check in the middle, not in front of one person especially the lady of a date. Unsure if I'll go back.",0
1,"After a 90-min wait (we were told it would be an hour), I went for dinner with my sisters. The food was just okay and over-priced. The polenta wasn't the best I've had, the cheese empanadas were not empanadas but rather fried little puff balls (and if they're going to be vegetarian, there should more more, not less of the meat ones), the cauliflower was pretty good but again, not worth the price. But let me tell you about our service! First the server brought out the wrong wine for my sisters (they got a red cab Mendoza, a white Chardonnay was delivered). Nobody really checked on us except to ask if we wanted to order more food. Then! One of my sisters PULLED A REALLY LONG HAIR OUT OF HER MOUTH AFTER TAKING A BITE OF FOOD!!!!!!!! When we alerted our server, his response was, ""ew, I'll be sure to tell the chef.""NEVER did we get an apology, nor was the item replaced nor taken off the check!!!!! And on top of that, he charged us for the red AND the white wine!!!!! The sister who had the hair is super polite and it was impressive that she even alerted him of the hair, so unfortunately she did not fight to have the item taken off, regardless of my urging her to do so. Alas, I decided to share this review. That hair was LONG AND NASTY! No way will I return. What a shame.",0
1,"I've come here several times, with locals and with my friends that are coming to New Orleans to visit. Although the food is okay, the service is waaaay below the standards of expect. The first time I came here I was blown away, every time after that I felt like was chasing the dragon. Don't get me wrong, the manager attempted to rectify our ""not so great experiences""... But that doesn't mean she can ensure every experience is satisfactory. The employees have given me sass and have not been so respectful of my time tables. Uhh so sad because I enjoyed this place but I think my days of being a Lucys fan is OVER.",0

1,"Ordered curried chicken, teriyaki, and some eggrolls with soup...I never got that orderThis was my first and last time ordering food from here. Delivery was quick, I'll give them that, but the order was wrong. When I called in they said I can have a free meal on them for the mistake.I said, okay ""I want that free meal now"" (they also offer free delivery for orders over 12.00$) my food came out to 14.87$, 18.87$ with tip.They refused multiple times (like it'll make a difference if they bring it now or tomorrow, either way it was a lie to get me off the phone). I informed her that if she didn't send her delivery guy back I'll dispute the amount paid to them with my bank, and they'll lose a new customer. Normally if one thing in my order was wrong I wouldn't mind at all. It's because my entire order was Wong...",0
4,Edley's is my favorite BBQ in town. If you are able to get there before the brisket is gone - order the brisket tacos or the brisket plate. They are amazing! You should also try the banana pudding and the Mac and cheese!,2
2,"This was the second time coming here.  First time we came the wait for a drink (only got a drink) was quite long.  The second time coming was for dinner.  I personally ordered a Johnny Blaze...this was good; however, the burger was half the size of the bun...So I feel like I just got one slider and a handful of fries.  The other order was a Ruuurouper (grouper tacos) which was sooooo rubbery tasting I actually spit it out.   It seemed as though I was gnawing on my tire.  It's unfortunate as the ambiance is pretty decent and wait staff was attentive.",0
5,"I come to Cucina Zapata way more than I should. What can I say, their food is absolutely delicious. It most certainly isn't what you'd expect from a typical food truck with their flavor packed menu. My favorite things to get are the Cap'n Crunch Tilapia Burrito and their Chicken Katsu. Portions are enough to fill me up on my lunch break and I always leave satisfied with a tasty meal and a full stomach.Around noon is when they are busiest which when you'll likely have to wait quite a bit longer than usual, but to be honest their food is worth it. My typical order is the chicken katsu with an egg on top. It comes with a nicely crunched chicken fillet on a bed of rice with some avocado and salads on the side along with the option to make it spicy or not (I personally put spicy mayo). Everything is freshly made each day and you can definitely taste it when you dig in. The workers there are extremely sociable and always greet you with a smile and they seem like they enjoy serving their customers. This truck will keep me coming for the remainder of my time at Drexel.Best things to get:Chicken Katsu PlatterCap'n Crunch Tilapia BurritoBBQ Short RibsSatay TacosThai, Mango, or Taro tea (w/without bubbles)",2

3,"Seooooooooooul Garden (does anyone else hear Soul Train in their head?) pretty decent Korean food, I love that you can grill at your table. Its fun, cooked the way you like it and its entertaining, but if someone doesn't like to cook, this may not be for them. Its a bit pricey, but most Korean restaurants in the area are. The service is hit or miss, they are never rude, they just don't come by often. My friend ordered a glass of wine, wanted a second one half way through our meal, but we couldn't get it ordered. anyways the bill showed up and the wine was $10 (for very average table wine) on the menu it stated it was $4 dollars, we asked why and we got ""oh i don't understand, so sorry"" strange, as she spoke to us in English when we ordered and asked her questions before, but by this time we were over it, paid for our meal and left.Over all i enjoyed the food and the grilling of the BBQ but I would rather take a trip over to Charlotte Rd.",1
1,Was a loyal customer of this place. It has changed hands to a different owner but is the same name.Bubble tea is now terrible and incredibly watered down. They are clearly trying to cut back and prices are more expensive but product is worse. It's such a shame original Lady is no longer their as her bubble tea was the best in the City. Now it's just terrible with no flavour and expensive and all water. Don't go here anymore!,0
5,"I've been here several times and my cat Toothless is under one of their Wellness Plans. The vet techs and vets are always very nice and helpful when it comes to checking her in, and unless there's a difficult case ahead of me, the check in is always quick and easy. They're also very good about contacting me when someone new or a potential problem comes up, and they call if they need to run any other checks. The price is a little much which is an issue with any vet that I've noticed, but they always treat Toothless very well and I've never had any problems with them.",2

A view of a concrete wall about 3 feet from my window.  Old carpets in halls and in rooms.  Definitely not worth 199/night. Unfortunately, all the other hotels in the immediate area were full.  Only good thing was the location and no cockroaches.",0

The reason we tried it was because it was on a night when we did not feel like going anywhere, as we were staying at the hotel for a convention.All the food we ordered was great !

1,"We liked this theatre the last time we visited but noticed the cleanliness wasn't up to snuff, this was in November 2016. I took the family back for an early matinee and I found the bathrooms  disgusting! I took photos due to another 2 people entering and turning around and leaving the bathroom due to the filth. I talked to R****ll and showed him the photos. His response to me was ""They are like that a lot because people trash them."" The management needs to go through some serious training classes. This AMC is losing their good clientele due to not keeping cleanliness standards higher. I don't want to know about the food items. We wont be back.",0

5,"My friend and I visited Tampa for a concert, and about ten minutes away from the Atlanta airport he realized that he had purchased tickets for the wrong day. We had already made hotel reservations and bought the concert tickets, so he just had to pay same-day price for airfare: all in all about $800 more. ""It was totally worth it,"" he later told me, ""Because I got to have the best sandwich of my entire life.""All because we randomly picked the Bricks of Ybor from Yelp. I can't vouch for the peanut butter or meatless menu, but the meat sandwiches that we bought were absolutely phenomenal. I had the pulled pork, which was flavored with ponzu and served on Hawaiian sweet bread. It was one of the best meals I've had in a long time. We spent a few hours hanging out and drinking, during which time Brian, the owner, came out and talked to us, comped us a drink, let us try new appetizers he was developing (all for free) and generally made us feel really welcome. I kept my eyes open to the kind of crowd that came in and out of the restaurant. It seemed to draw everything from hipsters to geriatrics and strait-laced families with young kids. I think it speaks to both the diversity of the menu and the pleasant environment. We went back for drinks before and after the concert. It got very crowded but we still received excellent food, drinks and service. I give this restaurant my strongest recommendation, and it's the first place I'm going when I next visit Tampa.",2
1,"I brought my cousin here on Christmas night. The food/beers were great, and the waitress was friendly. Several hours after I left, I realized that I had left my phone on the table. I drove back and asked the security guard who was standing outside Brew Brothers if they had found a phone, ""I haven't heard about any phone, I would check down stairs with security."" The security office also denied having found a phone. I went home and used ""find my iPhone"". It was still in the casino. I put it on ""lost mode"" - setting my best friend's number as the call back.  My friend, Alex, went back the next morning to try and find it. (I was at work, but kept a close eye for any changes on the map via laptop). He went up to the brew brothers, and spoke to the manager (bald with a beard). ""I was the manager that was on last night, and I assure you there was no phone found last night."" My friend then walked down to security, they hadn't found it.Meanwhile I was incessantly using the ""play sound"" function via my laptop. At some point Alex was called. Someone said ""hello""... then hung up. Alex went back to brew brothers and was like ""I know it's in there."" ""Ummmm... alright let me check"". He came out with it in hand, and was acting sketchy. ""It was making noise and scaring the employees so we turned it off.""",0
4,"It's located somewhat incongruously in South Philly, which is more known for Italian, Mexican, and cheesesteaks.The gun club is divided up into two floors. The main floor contains ammo, pistols, revolvers, rifles, and shotguns of varying calibers and gauges  for either rent and/or sale. In addition they also have gun related accessories, including laser scopes, loaders and such. The back part of the main floor has a waiting room where you can hang out until your number comes up as displayed by a digital LED sign above the door. They have some vending machines for drinks and snacks, and a TV if you want to be entertained while you wait.The range is upstairs.You can get ear protection and safety glasses if you haven't brought them. They have instructors who will instruct and help you learn how to shoot if its your first time. I was impressed by both instructors I saw. They were pretty thorough without using a lot of jargon and they were very personable. The older instructor that I saw was really nice and very encouraging to his students.The range itself is very clean and well maintained. Any problems with the target marker was taken care of fast. And they have employees circulating around so if there is someone who isn't acting safe, they identify and correct bad habits before anything can happen. You can buy targets and ammo for a fairly decent price, considering its a range. They do tend to stick to Federal ammo, which isn't the cheapest. But, it also doesn't tend to jam like some of the cheaper stuff. The rates for non-members isn't too bad, though it would probably pay to become a member if you are going to go more than one or two times.My only gripe, and its a minor one is that it gets really jammed with people on the weekends. So the earlier you go, the better.The people that run this really make it what it is, a fun place to enjoy yourself in a clean and safe environment.",2

This meal was one of the top three meals of my life and I've eaten at some of the best restaurants in the world. Our waiter, Richie Rich, was the best waiter we've ever had. The perfect combination of funny, knowledgeable, and compassionate, he made us feel like part of his family. The food was to die for. The bread was warm and fresh. The drinks were perfectly mixed. The raw oysters were fresh and succulent. I had the shrimp étouffée, which was excellent. My wife had the chicken, which was perfectly cooked and full of flavor. My children split the chicken tenders, which were obviously hand-breaded and perfectly cooked. The desserts were to die for! This was the best meal I've ever had in New Orleans and I've never had a bad meal in that town. Don't sleep on Luke!",2
4,"Ordered from here for the first time tonight. I got jalepeno poppers which were by far the best i've ever had, although they were a little pricey.I also ordered a small plain pizza, and after I finished off the poppers I opened up the pizza and realized there were mushrooms on it.  I was alright with that, to me I just got lucky with a free topping, but if it had been some kind of meat I would have been pretty bummed (I'm a vegetarian).  The pizza was really tasty, Crust was a little softer then I prefer but it was real good. I will definitely order from here again, maybe not for a little while just cause it is more expensive then other places.Also delivery was fast, and the guy called me right when he got to my house. A big problem I have with delivery places is when they call before they actually get to your house, cause I live pretty far out in the ghetto and I don't like standing around outside after they call... but these guys were right out front when they called me.",2

2,"Some of the fare on offer at That BBQ Place is wildly overpriced, especially given the fact that real cutlery, proper table service, and glassware are all missing.  While this place is as neat as a pin and while it offers very friendly service, I'm unlikely to return.  It won't matter, though, for it's busy enough that my custom is unlikely to be missed.  Their ribs still lack bark and they remain too moist for my liking.  In the end, Sherwood Parkers seem to like the place and that's all that matters for the owners.",0

I was originally very disappointed in the costumer service I received but since continuing to go back to Toyota my views have changed. Justin Shores is a great new employee that really takes the time to be empathetic, genuine and actually care about what is going on. I felt that he took care of me during the service process and really tried his hardest to help. Manuel is extremely kind, nice and helpful. Even when I was bummed out at the dealership he is such a happy person he'd make me smile. I'm sure there are other great employees but these two really helped me out substantially. So though I originally rated this dealership 1 star... I wanted to change that to the current rating. I am really appreciative of the help and responsive I have received since and I will consider coming back to this dealership in the future.",1

I ordered BBQ ribs which were the best I've ever had. My wife and son had the stuffed peppers which were excellent. That coming from an Italian means so much as we're reluctant to go Italian since few places cook like mama does. My daughter had the seafood platter which served at least 2 people and was some of the best seafood to date. Here's the best part. Our server, Roland, was the most personable, articulate, and genuinely service-oriented waiter we've ever met. I can say without reservation, Roland made the evening memorable and left us wanting to come back. Praline Connection is a 5 star restaurant, hidden gem, found only a short distance from the French Quarters. Please ask for Roland and enjoy your dining experience in a most casual way.",2

He doesn't understand that when working in a place of business where people are accompanied by their children you cannot curse out loud. He also doesn't understand that of a customer comes in close to closing time you don't tell them to hurry up. I don't care how good the food is. I wouldn't know because I lost my appetite and left. This guy is trash. And the management should realize that he's a reflection of them and their business. Definitely stay away. If you're starving, eat air. This place is terrible",0

This is usually my go-to place before an event at TCC. Unfortunately, I think it's everyone else's go-to place, and it can get very crowded. You order Chipotle-style, tell them what you want and what you want on it. They make it right there in front of you, and you grab it and sit down. There are complimentary chips and a decent salsa bar. Getting a table is the tricky part. When it's busy, you have to vulture it and immediately grab people's seats when they leave.They have great happy hour specials. I believe nachos are $2 off, and you can get 5 tacos for $10. I've heard the tacos are good, but I just can't bring myself to get anything besides nachos. They are excellent. They have a decent tap selection, but the margaritas are amazing so I usually get one of those. The mangoyita is so good! I am not a big drinker, but I can suck one of those down in no time at all. If you like chile mangoes, you can't pass it up! It's a little annoying having two tabs, ordering food at the counter and drinks at the bar, and you kinda have to be rude and aggressive to get a table when it's busy, but I'll manage for the great food and drinks!",2

3,"I was not completely satisfied with their food as I have been with other Mexican restaurants. The food was ok, I ordered it for pick up, and they charged me a fee for the to go containers??? Usually chips and salsa are included but with this order I was charged. The steaks seem to have no flavor, it wasn't horrible, but it wasn't the best.",1
2,"Paradise had been a long-awaited eatery in Tucson.....and while I was excited to try it out, unfortunately I was just wasn't wowed.  I'm not really sure what I was specifically expecting, but what I got was basically (in my humble opinion)sub-par cafeteria food at a high-end bistro price.When we walked inside, there were tons of staff, but nobody really greeted us and/or instructed us on the ordering process (which counter to go to, where to get drinks, etc).  I ordered half of the turkey/cranberry ""Signature"" sandwich (more $$) and half of a Caesar salad while my husband chose half of a regular turkey sandwich and half of a chicken Caesar salad.  We also got two fountain drinks.  $22.  I didn't blink twice because they advertised ""molasses bread"" and I'm a sucker for anything turkey-cranberry related.We found a booth (and the soda fountain, kind of hidden in the back) and when our food came, my face fell.  I could have made a better sandwich at home for less than half the price.  Nothing special about the bread, the meat was mechanically separated lunchmeat product and the cranberry was canned cranberry sauce that had so much water in it that it pooled onto the plate and ruined the bread.  Not impressed.  The tomatoes were flavorless and mealy (people, stop putting your 'maters in the fridge!) and the lettuce had definitely seen better days.The salads were okay- the croutons were actually really good (and normally I hate croutons) but the chicken, again, was rubbery processed lunchmeat product.  Gross!  On the plus side, lunch included a chocolate chip cookie, so that salvaged some of my experience.  I probably won't be back- for those prices I'd rather go to a local place and get fresher ingredients.",0
4,"A really good ice creamery with a million unique flavors, and the ability to order 4 or 6 small scoops so you can try a bunch. I was pretty full walking in, but still managed to eat 4 scoops and liked them all. The ice cream itself is maybe not quite the super gourmet vibe of Jeni's or Salt and Straw, but it was all very good and there are lots of cool flavors to try.",2
3,"I'm not a vegetarian or vegan but I enjoy the food from time to time. I ordered the Ziggy Burger it was eh. It was really dry and not much flavor, there wasn't much of the special sauce on the burger to begin with and I think if there was more it would've tasted better. My friend got the Philly Steak and said it was pretty good. We shared the sweet potato fries with the sriracha ailoi which was really good! Space is very limited for seats and my friend sitting on the shared bench was being moved every someone got up or sat down, kind of annoying. The staffed seemed nice but kind of impatient. Overall it was alright. If I come again I'll get something else since the burger just wasn't good and maybe I'll have a better opinion about the food. I will say the people who ordered a few of the drinks they have looked good.",1
2,"The staff was completely rude to us! This was my first time to here, but my fiance's 2nd time, and he was treated similar to this experience as well.  We will not come back here because we don't want to be treated like we are a bother to the staff, and they truely did not care about us.  It's not like we want to be there in the first place; my fiance had an accident and got hurt and really didn't want to go anywhere to be looked at, but I made him come to the local urgent care.  So with that being said, being treated the way we were did not help our situation.  We wanted to get out of there ASAP! The doctor wasn't even helpful.... Not going back again, and would not recommend this urgent care location.",0
5,"My husband and I have been renting from milpas rental for many years now. If I could give it 6 stars I would. They have anything you can imagine to rent. From scissor lifts to great quality power tools. Their fleet of equipment is always in top shape and never outdated. You not only get amazing customer service every time, but definitely the lowest prices around. Their staff is super knowledgeable and super friendly. When we had our wedding a few years back, we needed extra power for lighting and kitchen equipment, and they were so helpful with leading us towards what size cord we needed and even connectors for all of the lighting.  Keep up the good work Milpas Rental!",2
5,"This place is one of the best! I have been to their other location in Dunedin and it was completely different but both awesome in their own right. Clear sky on cleveland is a great spot for date night, super chill atmosphere and awesome craft cocktails at the bar. All of their food was super unique and an experience in itself. I would definitely recommend!!",2
2,"People seem to love this place for its beer selection.  The two times I've been in here I've been skeeved out to the max.  One time I swear there was the worst dressed pimp of all time and two of his workers.  Places like this should be closed, they're just fronts for liquor stores, their food is inedible.  Yes, it is nice to get a six pack for cheap. No, I wouldn't want one of these in my neighborhood.  Gotta agree with aaron ...avoid.",0
5,"Whenever we want the best sushi in town we have to come here. We almost always get the sashimi and sushi combination, along with a couple different orders of nigiri. Always amazing and worth the high price.",2
5,Love in n out. There's just a mood for in n out that you have to fulfill sometimes.What can I say. 4 patties animal style bruh,2
4,"Pricey for burgers and beer but very tasty. Get the rooster sauce for your fries, its a mayonaise flavored  sauce. Cool building and vibe with a modern industrial look. Would have given 5 stars if the beers offerings were larger for the price.",2
4,The 3rd floor King Room had a balcony on the side overlooking Bienville. The hotel has lived up to its reputation.  The staff is friendly and incredibly helpful.  The only issue we had is that the bed dipped in the middle.  We alerted the staff and issue was resolved.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat!,2
5,"I never try Trini food before I visit this place. It's like a food adventure for me. The Oxtail is amazing, unbelievable tasty. I will 100% return this place for the Oxtail dish. The jerk wing is also very favorable. I don't quite enjoy the goat Roti, is a ok dish for me.",2
5,"I've been to this salon several times for hair, nails and skin services. The staff are all professional and you will leave looking great! Katie did my hair in an updo for a wedding in June, and it was awesome. My hair has seriously never looked so good. Katerina is great for nails and make up. All the staff listens carefully to you about the color or style you want BEFORE they embark on the process, and they produce results accurate to what you're looking for. Meredith is the Operations Manager and is helpful booking appointments efficiently and as soon as possible. Sometimes I've called and just said ""I NEED a manicure, help!"" and they've fit me in that same afternoon.",2
1,If you can't come to work with pride and energy and enthusiasm then don't work at a McDonald's where people are in a hurry to get somewhere else.....so disappointed in the behavior of humans!,0
2,"Came here for a late lunch on a weekday. The place looks great, I love the decor and the general theme that they are going for. My service was something left to be desired. I wish the staff would have let me know the theme of the food or that it was a bit different than what most people may be used to. I love to try new things, just want to know all about it first. The drinks and chips made up for the food just being so-so bland. For trying to be a newer place, they literally need to season/spice it up! Be excited about your place and what it has to offer. Get some awesome flavors to jump at me!Faves: they do make some good in house tortilla chips",0
2,So I had a overall good meal but service was not very good and I ordered a New York strip with no mushrooms cause I'm allergic to mushrooms but they gave me them anyway I got mashed potatoes with gravy on the side but it came on top last but not least I ordered green beans and got broccoli but overall besides that it was a pretty good meal,0
5,"This place is amazing, and if you're a foodie you will be very impressed!  Do get there early though.  For the full menu, you need to be seated by 9, or you will have a wait.  We get there at 830 or 845 get pastries from the coffee bar and then order at 9... we have kiddo's so we don't like to wait too long.  By the way, it's great for kids, and the decor and vibe is very unique and awesome.  We love the lox pastry that you can get at the counter, their espresso is top notch, our kiddos love the ovaltine on the menu, and the boozy campfire cookies (although just a cookie, it is THE BEST cookie i've ever had) .  We've also had the cinnamon sugar donut holes (amazing!) and much more... but I'll just leave it at that.  Enjoy!",2
2,"Went to their new location on a saturday afternoon.  The place seemed to be run by a bunch of 16 year old girls, none of whom knew what they were doing.  All standing around looking confused and gossiping, as the girl with a cast on behind the cash register INSISTED on making and delivering the cocktail with her cast on, to a table.  Only one girl knew what she was doing, an african american girl with braided hair, and looked truly frustrated as she tried to behave like a real waitress.  She won't last there.I don't know who put these tacky girls in charge... but it's the first thing you see when you walk in... and frankly, i wouldn't eat there with what i witnessed on that Saturday.... money and food handling by inexperienced twits with no oversight, and I still feel sorry for that waitress.Food was good.... but i am concerned about how it's prepared.... considering what chaos that place was in.Too bad... they had great BBQ.",0
2,"I was so excited when this place opened a few years back.  For some reason, it took me forever to get there to try their stuff.  All and all, it's ok.  The bagels are not great - do yourself a favor and go the bagel factory about a mile down the road.  They have authentic NY style bagels; this place does not.The doughnuts are good - not great.  Somewhere between Dunkin' Donuts and a true bakery type of taste.  If you are going to partake, go with the maple bacon bar...it's the best on the menu.Bottom line from me, no on bagels...meh on doughnuts.  I'll probably be back, but would not seek it out.",0
2,"Okay, yes, I know it's a brewery, but the smell of hops was so strong and overwhelming the night we ate there, we were unable to enjoy our meal. My husband spent the whole time not-so-subtly with his shirt over his nose, and my kids kept begging to leave. I thought the tacos were decent, but we couldn't get past the smell.",0
5,"i've trained casually at various MMA gyms in the LA area and decided to try out Paragon at the recommendation of a friend. although I had ""trained"" before, going to a new gym is always nerve-wracking when you are not yet familiar with the setup... where do i put my bag? should I be wearing muay-thai shorts? is anyone wearing a mouth guard? how in shape am i REALLY? will i or will i not be the worst one in the class? suffice it to say, my anxiety was misplaced. the atmosphere at Paragon is so friendly and unpretentious (refreshing, after exposure to some more uppity LA gyms). i took a saturday am all-levels kickboxing class with Tyson, who leads a damn good workout and helps you with technique. it was a perfect mix of cardio and sparring combinations. needless to say i was the-good-kind-of-sore come sunday. gym quality is top notch. they had apparently just put in new mats which looked and felt great. the gym is huge so there was plenty of room for solid training, and everything was super clean. special hats off to the owner, Sean. he was really welcoming when I first awkwardly stumbled in. you can seriously tell how engaged he is with the gym and its members. he seemed to know everyone by name, regardless of whether they're gunning for their black belt, or just looking for a good weekend workout.",2
1,We'll I thought the place was going out of business. They basically had no cigar selection.,0
5,"I started going to Keri a few months ago and I love the experience every time I go in! I get a cut and highlights and it usually takes around two hours. Keri is always very pleasant and engaging (even though I go every 6 weeks or so, I am always amazed that she can remember our conversation in detail from the last time I was in!). It means a lot to go to a place and be treated like a regular when so many places barely remember your name despite going again and again. The other staff are always very friendly and make sure you're comfortable (take your coat, offer you something to drink, and even go out and pay your meter if it's about to run out!). And of course I love what Keri does with my hair every time I'm there! They are truly a high class salon and give the experience you'd come to expect from paying a premium price. Definitely worth it for the experience and level of talent!",2
5,"This place has great food, a great atmosphere, and very friendly staff. Hubby and happened upon this place accidentally and I'm glad we did. We will definitely be back...and we'll bring friends.",2
4,"Delicious both times I've eaten there, it can be a little loud but that's ok. Their butternut squash soup is to die for!",2
5,We stopped in for the crab and it did not disappoint.   The service was friendly and prompt.  We would definitely recommend this place as the crab and oyster shooters were great.,2
4,"As other Yelpers said, this is the best rest stop I have ever been to, too. It's got a lot of nice, natural light; the bathrooms are clean and plentiful; and there's plenty of seating to kick back, grab a meal, gain some sanity back, etc. The buses can also park close to the building itself, which is a big plus.",2
3,"Tired this place out with a group of 10.  It was a slow weeknight so there was no problem seating us quickly inside (group choice, there was room outside too).  As I arrived early, I started with a Spicy-sugar rimmed House Margarita in the Tiki Bar.  Great drink and nice outside space.  Ordered the guc and the spicy potatoes as appetizers.  Guc - nice flavor, chunky, definitely freshly made.  Spicy potatoes - so, so.  Shrimp tacos - good flavor on double corn tortillas.  Interesting sauce choices - didn't find any of them particularly hot or unusual. I would go again, but wouldn't make a special trip.",1
4,"It was nice walking into the club with VIP-like treatment.. bypassing the regular folks as they glared over while they were in the regular, long line. Tonic has one main dance floor and a nice outdoor patio. This place is perfect for dancing the night away with great music playing and a fun crowd.. totally reminded me of Vegas/SD  nightlife and I forgot I was in Santa Barbara for a minute :P -perfect for Bachelor/Bachelorette parties-enjoy the fresh air and escape the dancefloor by being out on the patio-fun ambiance and club lighting!-great DJ's playing mostly EDM with a little bit of hip hop music in the mix-not many creepers like other bars/clubs-nice, beautiful crowd",2
2,"I was very surprised by how mediocre this place was. 4 1/2 stars on yelp I was expecting so much more. I love authentic Mexican and was really hoping that get that experience here.We drove up and walked in. Can't say there is anything particularly special about the building and/or decoration. Bland, awkward layout. I ordered a carne seca breakfast burrito, chips/salsa and got a horchata. They gave my the drink right away and I sat down. Started drinking my horchata and wasn't impressed. Pretty sure Kern's has a better mix than this - not much flavor at all.Sadly, I continued to sit there for another 20 minutes before getting my burrito or my chips. I understand that food takes time, but I've been to enough fast Mexican food places to know it shouldn't take that long and if all else, they could have at least given me the chips and salsa (which was really just red sauce, not salsa). Once I finally had a chance to eat the burrito, it wasn't good. Bland - not even sure it was carne seca, at least in my opinion.Needless to say this play is ok at best. Not very flavorful or memorable.",0
4,"I was on my way to the bus station and made my way in here.I've been to ""dollar stores"" where nothing is actually above $1. This store is of the ""all prices are in increments of $1 or 25 cents or 50 cents"" variety.I found quite a few steals and some things that I can get better elsewhere. A 2-pack of Colgate Plus toothbrushes for $2 was definitely a steal. The Colgate toothpaste made in Mexico -- if you don't have a problem with that, then it was a bargain. (My husband once bought a $1, full-sized, national brand toothpaste made in India at a competing Dollar Store.)Bought a cutlery organizer for $3. I considered getting one of those BPA-free glass food containers for $4 --  I know I've seen them for a few bucks more elsewhere. The next time I'm here, I'll get the 2-pack, hypo-allergenic, polyester jumbo pillows for $6.Staff was attentive. I barely got in line when a cashier who was working in the aisle I was last browsing, called me over to her register.And in an area that's devoid of any businesses open during a weekend, this place is open daily. The area is somewhat dodgy, but in the daytime, I felt safe walking around.",2
5,Jones brunch is amazing. Went with four friends and we got the all got bottomless Bellinis which is a great deal. They let it sit there for 2 hours while we drank as much as we could. The mac and cheese is to die for. Monkey bread is a great appetizer for the table. Chicken and Waffles was really good. Chicken was moist and and the skin was gently fried. The syrup was nice and sweet. The Ambiance was great. We have reservations and we were seated right away.This place is vegetarian-friendly. The server was friendly. Only thing I regret is not trying their dessert.,2
5,"I stopped in for a drink yesterday and have to say the atmosphere gets an A+ from me.  Such a unique concept for the St. Pete area.  The attention to detail with the remodel was outstanding, it almost feels like you are in a Harry Potter movie or something.  There is background music that is set at a low volume so you can clearly hear your friends or not have to shout for them to hear you - perfect for the old library-esque environment. Working behind the bar were Michael and Peggy - both couldn't have been more friendly and were overall just interesting people to talk to.   I had eaten dinner already before I came so can't speak on the food but will definitely be back to try - the prices for meat/cheese trays are much better than comparable places in the area.  I would definitely recommend checking this place out...",2
2,"I really wanted bagel and lox but they were out of bagels so I opted for the lox eggs Benedict. It came out with the lox fried! Yuck! Since I won't send anything back unless it is inedible I lived with it. I just don't understand frying lox. Who does that?  Otherwise this is a good diner with attentive wait staff but I just can't get past the fried lox.  Lox, by definition, are not cooked but smoked only. If it is going to be fried, then it's just salmon.",0
5,"BEST. SUSHI. IN. TOWN. The place itself doesn't look like anything special; a few table and a sushi bar. However, the fish is always fresh and well prepared. If you're into sauces and fish combinations in a single roll, this might not be the place for you. The chirashi is priced very well during lunch and the portions are generous. For an authentic Japanese restaurant in town, this is it.",2
5,This ice cream was deliciously decadent and one of the creamiest I've ever had. So sad they are selling!,2
5,"Sat at the outdoor bar, by far my favorite place at st. Pete. Live music, cool air blowing from the cielling fans, friendly bartender, and oh so delicious food! Our bartender recommended the Tuna topped oysters (sorry can't remember the name) and I had the lobster ravioli, yum!! Great atmosphere! Loved everything!",2
5,We just moved to the area and have been here almost weekly. Everything we tried has been good. We have gotten take out and brought to friends houses and they loved it too.,2
5,"Nice atmosphere.  Fresh and high quality sushi. Friendly servers. I was very pleased with my first time visit at Jasmine restaurant. I have noticed they have a beautiful, large round table that would probably sits about 12-15 people. It would be perfect for a large company. There were many Asian families dining. I usually consider it is a good sign since they truly know how Chinese food and sushi should be.Overall, great experience.  I would recommend it.",2
1,"Went there for brunch today. Unfortunately, the person assigned to the omelet station had no idea how to cook AND she was sooooooo slow.  She overcooked every omelet and could not handle a two burner station.",0
5,"Love this place! Great food, and the owner will help you pick something if you are not sure what to order. Try the king fisher beer. Save room for desert! Great change of pace from regular boring food",2
4,Brought my 4Runner to replace catalyst converter. Within a few hours I was back on the road. Great service.  Definitely recommend to any friend.,2
3,Its worth a go.  Although its not huge-trust me your kids will have fun.  Remember to Bring your own towels and I suggest you bring water shoes too.Very Cute-with a retractable roof-which is perfect for the winter time.  Place is kept well enough.  There is a baby/small toddler area with their own slide and water sprinklers.,1
5,"The Cubby Hole is very intimate and has great food. I've been there several times for lunch and breakfast, they don't disappoint. The coffee and baked goods are excellent.",2
4,Portion size of the food is big. I ordered the nachos with beef and cheese special needed a little salt but other than that it was good. service on the other hand we had a new waiter not very attentive friendly but not attentive how to call him twice would come again to try other stuff on the menu and a different waiter,2
3,"Simple flavors and well prepared. Understaffed at lunch. Fried Dumplings good, not great but not  greasy. Pork buns really tasty, pork a bit tough. General Tsos chicken delicious. Broccoli room temperature. Rice was fluffy and hot. Unusual to like rice that much  There's a skilled cook back in the kitchen for sure. Overall good feeling in the dining room but only one server for three tables + takeout+ phone. I'll be back. Uneven but worthwhile.",1
1,This grovstyles is very unprofessional and took forever for my order to come in and never do I shop there again,0
5,"Very cute, reminds me of a Trader Joe's. They have the best smoothies! I recommend the Pineapple Express.",2
2,"Very disappointed.  Decor was okay. Cathedral ceilings and open floor plan.  Seemed like an appropriate venue for a wedding reception.   Menu had way to many choices. Two pages for just starters. Hard to make up your mind. ""Less is more"".  Service was okay. I ordered a seafood salad as my entree, my friend ahi tuna (seared) and my other friend a chicken sandwich.  We also ordered 3 starters for the table. Spicy shrimp dish (can't remember the name), tuna ceviche and edamame.  Its is really hard to mess up edamame, so that was okay. We did not finish the ceviche, it had no taste at all. The shrimp starter was the high light of the meal. Very good!  My seafood salad was really sad.  I felt like a rabbit eating dry vegetables. I told my server that I wanted to change my dressing to just plain lemon and olive oil. The salad came out with no dressing at all. My friends ahi tuna was pretty bad. Just did not taste fresh and the sauce for dipping was bland. My other friend enjoyed his chicken sandwich. I have two things to say. 1-they seemed to have put more attention into the way the food looked on the plate then the flavor of the food.  The plating was above average.  2- if you go, try to stick to basic dishes that are hard to mess up,  for example there seared ahi tuna dish was a disaster, but there grilled chicken sandwich was good.  Anything on the menu over $15 stay away from.   I most likely will not return unless I hear that they have consolidated there menu and changed the flavor profile to most of there dishes.  Btw my friends got 2 ice coffee lattes and they where $5 each. That seemed a little pricy, I could be wrong.",0
5,The best cheese steaks around! Such nice and friendly staff don't think I have ever had any issues,2
4,"Perfect little place to stop in for good food and drinks for an even better price - something you don't find everywhere!  The fish tacos were good, not the best, but for the price and how quickly they were prepared, I was very happy.  My friends raved about their Korean BBQ tacos, so if that's your type, give 'em a try because you can at least know your wallet won't regret it!  The bar and inside area fills up quickly with a crowd, but outside is where it's at anyway.  They have it all set up without too much ""atmosphere,"" so you and your friends can spread out.",2
5,"The people at the store amazing! We came in to exchange a shirt from a few days before they had had some damage, and the managers were so helpful with our situation. Tonya is the best. Without hesitation she is going to help us out.",2
5,Inexpensive and good quality dry cleaning service. They have done a great job on my shirts.   Friendly owner.,2
3,"I really wanted to like Milk and Honey, but we had a pretty average meal here. My streak was over cooked, and tough to chew. Other meals were nothing to write home about. They were also out of some of the whiskey's on the menu and dessert items.  In a city with so many great options, won't be back.",1
4,"This is a great place to watch away games (or if you aren't lucky enough to score tickets for home games).  It's the quintessential neighborhood ""dive"" bar, the kind we love so much here in NOLA!  On game day, they also provide great bar grub.  For the more pleasant times of year, there's a nice patio area.  If you're in the neighborhood, most definitely stop in for a drink, or three...",2
5,"This is our favorite go-to date night location! We tell all of our friends about Hidden River!  Love the beer, farm-to-table food options, and atmosphere. Staff is ALWAYS so nice and helpful. We've been here for drinks on the deck, dinner, and the ghost tours. Can't wait until the warmer weather really hits and we can lounge outside! You guys are awesome!",2
5,My sister had been wanting to do archery for a while so I grabbed a random Groupon to try this out. Turned out to be a ton of fun and it wasn't super busy on a Tuesday evening so we both got to simultaneously shoot. The owner (I am assuming) has an absolutely insane sense of humor. It seemed the people who were already there are regulars and extremely helpful in keeping me from breaking the rules and killing myself. Truly a fun place to be and a great experience. Not a bad way to spend an evening. 11/10 will recommend!,2
5,"Was there today morning. Awesome place! Cosy atmosphere, tasty food, huge portions and affordable pricing! Also the coffee there is pretty good. Got very tasty cappuccino for $3.5.",2
5,"BRING ME ALL THE BEERS! That's what I want to say when I come here. I always feel like the bartender is getting impatient because he doesn't think I know anything about beer, but it's really because I love Belgian beers, dark beers, German beers...I love the beer they have here and it tears my heart out to choose! I agonize over my beer choice because they all sound (and probably are) so awesome. The food is really good too. I've had the Cuban sandwich, pretzels, bratwurst, and something else and considered licking the wax paper to get the last morsels. Sweet little patio overlooking the street and indoors seating too. Don't let the various doors confuse you, there are multiple ""rooms"" inside so they need several doors. Haven't been for a movie or music yet but look forward to it.",2
4,"I have been to numerous different nail salons and spas in Tucson to get a pedicure, and this place takes the cake and others were major flops! For starters, this location offers personal boxes for a one time fee of $5 with your own nail tools, which really makes me feel more sanitary. In addition, the chemical smells of most nail salons is pretty much non-existent here, which really appeals to me. Their location is very spacey and welcoming and on top of that everything is very clean and well kept. Great place to come to really relax and get your nails done. For $25 you can get a great pedicure, and for $30 you can get their additional callous treatment, and while it's gross to see what can come off your feet, it leaves them feeling like a babies butt. Compare them, I dare ya! ; ) Worth the extra $5 for me! And something that a lot of nail salons struggle to fix for me is ingrown toe nails. Not that any of you needed to know that about me, but it's a big deal to me to have found a place that can not only fix them, but do a spectacular job that will last until my next monthly pedicure!  If you haven't found a good place to get your nails done in Tucson, definitively give this place a try!",2
3,"Sbraga: good, but not great. I dined here on a Saturday evening and ordered the four course tasting menu with some friends. We were seated promptly and the service was great. I ordered the fried green tomatoes with smoked shortbreads and cumin aioli, sea bream with rustic bread salad and hummus, meatloaf with bacon marmalade and the chocolate mousse taste with pistachio ice cream. My first two courses were excellent. It was my first time eating shortbreads, and I was pleasantly surprised. The sea bream dish was light and very tasty. However, I felt things fell short with the meat course and the dessert. The texture of the meatloaf was too crumbly, and I think I prefer my meatloaf to be a little more solid. It also seems that they included olives in their bacon marmalade and the taste of the marmalade was just too vinegary for me. And as for the dessert, it was just ok. I was able to taste the other desserts my friends ordered, and I was not really impressed by them, either. Also of note, almost every dish that came out was liberally garnished with dill-not that I mind dill, but after the third course, that was a lot of dill. Overall, it was a good meal. But for $49 dollars, I don't know if I would necessarily come back.",1
3,"Tried the howling wolf because it was close to our hotel and took a chance. The food was typical bar fare, with a Louisiana twist. I had the jambalaya and the gator balls. Wasn't super impressed with either. The jambalaya was cold and some bites had hard rice. The gator balls had a good favor but the texture was a little off putting. The beer selection was great and it seemed like a perfect place to come by and have a drink after a conference meeting. Just maybe not for food.",1

1,"What a dive! It took the new owners no time to return Kelly's back to its dive status of yesteryear.The food is so-so. It's dumpy and smelly. The floor is sticky. The tables and chairs are a mess. The silverware is grungy. Not fit for anyone but drunken college kidsBest to go to a restaurant if you want to keep your appetite and eat. This is just a place to watch kids puke out front, if that's what you;re into.",0
5,"We were a few minutes late but they still added us on to the tour and caught is up to the group.  We had an awesome guide,  very friendly and personable!  Great beer sampling at the end,  you get two free samples.  They also have a gift shop,  and they sell wing sauce.  I didn't try it but it looked amazing!  Would highly recommend!",2
5,"If u love ice cream, you'll be in heaven here!  A must try!  So many unique flavors to choose from and they're always changing.",2
3,"At Xochitl, I had both the best of food and the worst of drinks which is why I only gave it 3 stars. I had the best Spicy Brisket Taco. Ever. The Esquites is divine. However, the Shrimp Chile Nogada was just ok (wouldn't order again) and they make the WORST basic margaritas I have ever had. I realize margaritas aren't exactly old world Mexico and authentic to the culture pre mid 1930's or 40's, but if you are going to taut your margs, at least try. The atmosphere is quaint in the historic district and the servers helpful, though not very attentive.",1
4,This is by far the one of the better grocery store around Vail area.  Selection of diverse product lines and customer friendly workers.  I pick this location over the one on 22nd Street.,2
3,"This place was ok. The parking is free which is honestly unheard of in this area so that was good. Couple things that weren't good were that I reserved a concierge level room and when I got there was told there weren't any available but I got concierge access with a normal room. Interesting though as several folks checked in after me and got rooms on that level. I did check out the concierge lounge and it was TINY, i mean like closet sized so not sure it's worth it to pay more for that anyway. Also my keys didn't work to come from parking the car to the hotel so I had to walk down 3 ramps to go to the main entrance... when i told the front desk she was like ok and that was it. Wifi was good but I'll definitely stick with Marriott.",1
4,"I luv coming here. If I am on my lunch hour , they are very good about getting the food and my check out so I am not late .I had the Banzai Burger. Done the right way and it was yummy. I also like the loyalty program. Every time I come I try a new item and I have not been disappointed yet !Staff is friendly",2
4,"Who doesn't love a place that combines ice cream and coffee? Upon entering this place the smells wafting from the back were tantalizing. The setup when entering is a little awkward but after making my way back I was anxious to decide which flavor I was going to try. When I saw they had a bread pudding ice cream the decision was easy (you can pretty much guarantee I'll try anything bread pudding related). I selected the single scoop in a waffle cone which was a nice sized scoop and was quickly out the door to enjoy the frozen goodness. The ice cream was nice and creamy but the frozen bread chunks (at least I think that's what they were) were a little odd for me. The waffle cone was fresh and crispy and the perfect accent to finish off the ice cream. It was a nice, tasty, refreshing treat, but a little expensive for a cone in my opinion.",2
1,I heard great things about this restaurant so we put our name down for a party of 4 on a friday night and the hostess told us it would be 30 min - 1 hour wait and to go grab a drink down the street somewhere since their bar was crowded. We went down the street to Boogaloo and a friend decided to join us so we called the hostess and asked to add our reservation to 5. After waiting for one hour we received a call from the hostess and she told us they would not be able to fit us in that evening. It was now 9:00 and we had already waited an hour...had we know they wouldn't seat us we would not have waited an hour to eat. We walked down the street to speak to the manager and he did not have a solution nor was he willing to squeeze us in. I was not impressed by this service. I wouldn't recommend this place. We ended up eating at Acero and it was excellent and they were welcoming and had great service.,0
1,I don't even know why I'm giving this one star . I didn't even actually get to eat anything. Upon arrival we were seated promptly. As we waited for somebody to come over and offer us drinks or anything for that matter 10 minutes had passed as we got up and left without being asked one question.  Great service good job guys.,0
1,"Terrible experience. Made two appointments for blowouts over a week in advance. Both appointments were for 4:00pm as we had a function to attend at 6:00pm. We arrived at 3:55 & were welcomed as we checked in, even offered a drink. 20 minutes later, we were still waiting. There are only 2 people that do blowouts & both had other clients in their chairs, which I assume we're walk-ins. At that point, we decided we had waited long enough & left to rush home & do our own hair. That was our first & last time trying this salon. As residents of St. Petersburg, there are plenty of other options & not honoring appointments is a bad sign in my book!",0
3,"Being a local, I have to give Luke 3 stars... Ok 3 & 1/2 if I could. I love the atmosphere and the food is pretty good, but I wouldn't ever go out of my way to eat here. I've been several times with high hopes since I'm a Besh fan but haven't ever really been impressed. I think there are better places in the city where you can get similar food. It's one of the better places in the CBD I suppose, but not city-wide. To sum it up, food is good but not amazing. And they do have a great happy hour!",1
5,Great food good times if your looking  for a great time this is the place hands down the staff are professional and always taking care of their customers tell unsweetened tea comes in a huge glass and the food comes in huge portions the customers are nice and will hold a great conversation with you as well.,2
5,"I give this an overall five stars for the entire experience.  I visited my sister in LA and she sprung on the great surprise that we were headin' to Santa Barbara for the weekend.  The Shellfish Company sits on the end of the Stern's Warf which is one of the longest deep-water pier between Los Angeles and San Francisco.  From the outside you can see the tanks of fresh Abalone, Dungeness Crab, and the infamous Spider Crab.  You must make a reservation here and be prepared to wait a bit.  The inside is a classic, you are here for the food not the ambiance,  tavern style seafood bar with outside seating (be careful it can get windy). My sister and I sat at the bar.  The bar and overall inside seating is pretty tightly compacted which may bother some.   We, however, were in seafood heaven and talked it up with the staff/bartenders who were really awesome; enjoying life kinda people - they tipped it to the official 5 star review. We started with the Abalone for an appetizer which was really good; perfectly seasoned and cooked. I also had to try the chowder - awesome, but Maine's is better!   They have a decent array of beers on tap and I chose a local brew.  For dinner we split the Spider Crab cause we ain't scared of shh... ok, maybe I was a little....it was huge!!!  The dinner combo, I believe, came with choice of soup or salad.  Splitting the crab was definitely enough for two people. I recall my sister throwing in the towel and me testing my manhood.  My one critique is that I thought the Spider Crab was over cooked.  It by no means ruined the meal and may not be noticed by most but I know my seafood. Overall one of the best experiences ever.  If you go to Santa Barbra you MUST go here!",2
5,"Some of the best sushi I've ever tasted!  Run by a husband & wife team, and they always remember my name when I come in!  This is my goto place for Sushi in the Cherry Hill area.",2
5,California burrito but I get it *deep fried w/ sour cream & guacamole along w/ my carrot bag and a side of ranch. Love that they put so much meat in that shit! Love me my California burrito!,2
2,"Had spent 2013 New Year there for 3 days. General speaking, the facility is OK but the management and service is not professional. When I talk to staff, I feel like they are more like staff who operates a family Inn or a lodge...Good things: 1. complementary breakfast, good quality and variety2. facility is good, lobby is comfortable, in-door pool is kids friendly, a good out-door jacuzzy3. location is convenient for car and air transportationBad things: 1. very loud heater in room2. unprofessional receptionists, apparently they were not trained, a few examples: a young boy staff was collecting towers in the in-door pool, one tower was used by some guest to clean the car maybe so has lots of dirt on it, the staff said bad words in front of some kids nearby; I one time pass-by the lobby and hear some staff members were complaining about some customers loudly; housekeeping on busy hours occupied both elevators for a couple of hours and long queues were accumulated on almost every floor. On 12/31/12 the breakfast was gone some fast and starting from 8:30am the refill was kind of stopped. The promised breakfast ends at 9:30amWouldn't recommend is you have other choices.",0
5,"I've had Pastrami from pretty much everywhere in the Lou. BCD, hands down has the best. Prez Ruben will knock your socks off!",2
3,"My fiancé and I ate breakfast here and it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either.  I had the beignets which were overly sweet and the filling didn't quite work. The fiance had the southern breakfast, said the eggs were cooked poorly and the grits were too salty.  Overall it wasn't terrible, but it was probably the most disappointing meal we had during our four day trip to New Orleans.  We did eat here on a Monday morning so it may have been an off day.",1
4,"The scenery is amazing. The bayou is literally right outside and its beautifully chaotic. The entrees were amazing. We got the bbq shrimp and jalapeño grits and the crab cake lafitte. Both were amazing. The flavor profiles were out of this world. I would have given it 5 stars, but the bread pudding dessert left something to be desired. The entrees were so good it set me up to thinking the dessert would be even better. I would definitely recommend and come back.",2
4,Ordered a large pizza-1/2 pepperoni and 1/2 cheese. The crust is not too thin and not oily at all. I subtracted 1 Star because I found it a little too salty. Otherwise- not bad.,2
4,"Nice pizza place with good pizza and great service. I am not a big pizza person and dont eat much pizza though, so my review might not mean much here haha. We got small pizzas of crudo, melanzana, and salsiccia. Crudo was good, though I am more of a fan of red pizza than white pizza, and the meat was a bit spare but delicious regardless. Salsiccia was great with a wonderful mix of (a good amount of) sausage and fennel. Melanzana was ordered by one of my friends who is a vegetarian. I didnt think it would be that good (and im not a big fan of eggplant), but it really impressed me; it might be even better than crudo and salsiccia.  The portions were good and filling (one small pizza per person). However, the bread was quite thin, and i love thick dough, so that was a bit of a con.",2
5,"The food was great, the service excellent.  Had dinner outside on the deck, saw lots of dolphins.  Will come back for sure.",2
5,Great omelets and grits. We try to stop here when in the area for breakfast. Pretty yummy and nice wait staff too. It's worth the trip to this place if you're looking for a great breakfast. Probably lunch too but all we've had here was breakfast.,2
4,Happened to stop at Zorba's on our way back from the Eastern Penitentiary.  Great Greek food. You have lots of choices. Few outside tables & very nice & elegant looking inside. Ordered a tilapia gyro & it was scrumptious. You must try this place.,2
1,"Although I love pretty much anything that has to do with whiskey, I'm giving this place a thumbs down. Overpriced and underwhelming. The ambiance is super contrived (I typed that even at the risk of sounding like a huge douch-nozzle) and the wait staff are useless.",0
5,"As I grow in disenchantment with each passing day in this city, I desperately needed to find something worthy of praise.  My positive childhood memories of Edmonton were being marred by modern reality.  I was almost apprehensive in returning to the local science center that I had loved so much.  It had been so long, I had a full head of hair back then and this place was called the Edmonton Space and Science Centre.  I considered turning around and returning to the car, allowing my memories to remain untarnished, but the girlfriend encouraged me further.  And good thing to, because the TELUS Science World is still amazing.  I returned to my youth, ready and willing to being enveloped in the science I fell in love with, the science that awoke me to the truths of the world.  Not going to lie, I felt a little out of place...the majority of the exhibits are for children, and despite wanting to channel my inner-toddler, I was forced to avoid them.  However, I still must praise the polish of the exhibits themselves, especially one particular display of an active representation of stellar bodies by projecting video upon a spherical surface.  The illusion was fantastic in recreating the Earth, Sun, Moon, and Mars, only slightly marred when my towering frame walked in front of a projector.  The permanent exhibits are appealing, and I appreciated that old wireframe moon lander simulator was still here after thirty years.  Damn you girlfriend for making me remain an adult.  I wanted to play!  No, I don't want to leave early.  I never wanted to be a child again more, not that I needed much of an excuse to act like one.  Hell, I've always considered myself just a cheap facsimile of an adult poorly controlled by an immature mind fumbling over controls, ever vigilante for those brief moments when no one was looking in order to play with toys again.  Perhaps my positive experience was fortified by the seasonal feature, Dinosaurs Unearthed.  For those who need reminding, Dinosaurs are always awesome in any form they take, scientifically accurate or not.  Whatever device you employ, be it genetic cloning, time travel, or alien transplantation, there's no reason dinosaurs should not be included in a story.  I always though E.R. would've been more interesting if George Clooney had been replaced by a diplodocus.  You would think considering our visit was a mere three days after touring the Royal Tyrrell Museum, that I would've been tired of dinosaurs, but clearly you don't appreciate the appeal of giant lizards roaming the Earth millions of years before man.  I think that fact alone is what turned me away from religion...well, that and Star Trek.  Man they need to put dinosaurs in Star Trek.  Well, I guess there was the Gorn, but that hardly--ahem, where was I.  Right.  In fact, the variations between the two exhibits is worth noting.  At Royal Tyrrell, the majority of exhibits were skeletons, while the exhibits at the TELUS Science World were animatronic representations of living animals--beautiful, colored, feathered dinosaurs.  That alone should be enough of a draw, but no, because The Margaret Zeidler Theatre is still functioning.  One of the largest and coolest dome theaters you're ever likely to see, the Margaret Zeidler Theatre is the dominant reason I come to Science World, and now soon to be the only real reason to visit Edmonton in its entirety.  If allowed, I would sit for every film, twice even.  I miss the old Zeiss optical-mechanical projector--that thing in the center that looked like the chaos gate-creating warp drive from Event Horizon.  Alas, the increasing failure and cost of parts, and the efficiency of digital projectors made maintaining the old goliath uneconomical, but it didn't appear to affect the resulting experience.  The Digital Universe film almost brought me to tears given its epic scope and masterful presentation.  Unlike the IMAX film, you can watch as many dome shows as you wish.  Our ticket actually included the aforementioned IMAX, so we opted for the must-see Walking with Dinosaurs Prehistoric Planet 3D, a shortened and unequivocally superior variation to the feature film massacred by 20th Century Fox by adding annoying and unnecessary voice overs.  It's a damned shame this version is not available for purchase.  I am going to miss the TELUS Science World, as it was the only spot worth visiting in Edmonton.  Although still remarkable, and remaining the top of a very short-list of places to visit in Edmonton, it's simply not enough for me to make the diversion in future trips.  Thank you TELUS Science World for influencing my childhood and remaining steadfast in your quality against the depreciating value of the city around.  I could finally be a kid again.",2
4,"I was looking for a decent sushi restaurant and Osaka Sushi was recommended to me. I am happy that I have it a try. I have only eaten dinner there once, but will be back. The Crab Meat Rangoon was really good as was the Mexican roll that I had for dinner. Prices are very reasonable and the food that we had was very good.",2
1,"Bad experience!!  There was a large  loud party in the bar when we arrived.  We were told they would leave in 15 min. but they did not leave for 75 min.  If told the truth, we would not have stayed.  Only choices were to yell at your companion or not communicate.  Chosen wine not available and not offered another selection at the same price.  When we complained to the staff about the service and the noise, we were  made to feel like it was our fault and offered no sympathy or compensation.  The good food was ruined by the abysmal service and the noise.",0
5,"We tried Lamb kabobs and chicken vindaloo tonight and were very happy with both. We love hole in the wall places! This one fits the bill, too. It's primarily take out inside a convenience store. The proprietor told us about the lunch special which offers a variety of food so you can find your favorite. We are going back for fresh chili chicken tomorrow! I suggest if you like it spicy, ask for it. The food was delicious and flavorful, but not spicy enough for our palates.",2
5,"Like the whiskey selection, the bartenders are lively and knowledgeable. The food is great, especially the burgers and sandwiches.",2
5,"Loved this tour! I grabbed a groupon and the price was great. It was the perfect way to explore New Orleans for someone who'd never been there before and didn't know a lot about the history of the city. Our tour guide had tons of interesting tidbits about the city, and I really enjoyed the experience. Highly recommended tour. I actually thought we were just going to tour through the cemetery, but she took us around the French Quarter for the first hour, and the cemetery for the second half of the tour. You'll meet up in front of a grocery store (seems strange at first, but it's not terribly hard to find, and it'll give you a chance to get some water), and you'll stop at a visitor center part way through the tour for a bathroom break if needed. This tour was one of my favorite parts of my trip!",2
1,The service was so very bad. We walked out after waiting half an hour for any food to appear. Avoid this place.,0
3,"It's a clean gym, with an ok vibe, the locker rooms are large and clean, and the staff is cool and helpful.",1
5,Honestly this restaurant was one of the most unique experiences that I've had in Philadelphia not only was our waiter extremely nice and very knowledgeable of the customs of Morocco he was very respectful and allowed us to peruse tothrough the meal at our own speed. The food was exquisite and unique I loved the music the Decour was excellent and honestly I don't think I've ever had as authentic food as I had here at market,2
5,"Extremely competent, prompt and upfront and fair about price. Had an issue that required trouble shooting, some general repairs and adding outlets done to my complete satisfaction. I will use them a gain and give my highest recommendation.",2
5,"Their bobba is amazing! All of the food I've tried is exquisite and reasonably priced, I would definitely recommend eating here and trying some of their food.",2
5,"I stopped in to buy my favourite macaroons from where else, Duchess, when low and behold there is a store next door. Oh goodness, it is a whole store by Duchess filled with the most amazing, well like the name says: Provisions!There are cookie, cake and pie making equipment. A How-To kit for duplicating their famous macaroons. All the gadgets one would need to bake a masterpiece are in this delicious little side venture. They even have a wall stocked with jams, honeys, caramels, chocolates, nuts, salts, sugars and other high end, super must have ingredients to wow your taste buds (and show off to your dinner guests!) I bought a delightful crystallized honey as well as a jar of salted caramel that is so amazing it could be drizzled on a dust bunny and make it taste divine! I also added to my insane cookie-cutter collection, which I hide from my other half so he doesn't think I'm Kitchen Cuckoo! Oh, wait... I think he's on to me ;)This is definitely a must visit store if you are a culinary wizard, or just like to wing-it! It is a go-to destination to pick up that perfect hostess gift or for your super foodie friend. And even a $4 jar of something, in its beautiful package, will make anyone feel like a Duke or a Duchess!",2
5,"WOW, a great meal. We had the nachos, chicken and waffles, and the mushroom ramen. I was blown away. Sadly we live 40 mins away but the menu and the staff were great! We are for sure going to go back again. Flavors were greatly complex and their wide use of mushrooms shows they know what they were doing. Cant wait until next time.",2
5,"I live down the street from this place and I really enjoy coming here. It doesn't get too crowded and the drinks are really cheap. It is a smoking bar, so be prepared.  They make great sandwiches, but the kitchen closes pretty early. The bartenders are always on point and nice, and the other patrons are friendly. They have shuffle bowling, pool, and darts, too. Check it out if you're in the area and feel like hanging out at a gem if a dive bar.",2
1,"I have eaten here several times during the four years I have lived in Philly, and have had happy hours or cocktail events here as well, as an employee of a company in the building; and I have had wonderful experiences. This is thanks completely to the *servers, bartenders, and kitchen staff*. On Valentine's Day, however, we had a very different experience. I am confident that the servers and kitchen staff were amazing as always, but we never found out. We made our reservation about a month and a half early, to ensure a window seat. OpenTable asked for a credit card when booking--no problem; we provided it. Upon arrival, we were told that, since we did not place a deposit, there was not a table for us. Yes, they could see our reservation in the system, they said; they can see the date on which we placed the reservation, a month and a half prior. However, they claim to have called us (one time) to get a deposit from us, and since they were unsuccessful, they didn't hold us a table (again, they can see our reservation, they knew we were coming).  **No one had ever called to obtain a deposit from us.**  Further, had they needed a deposit, that should have been worked out between OpenTable and R2L--not our problem. OpenTable asked for a credit card and we provided one. Plus, how incredibly rude is it to require a deposit for a table reservation anyway? As a semi-regular at this place I find that greatly offensive. We weren't speaking with hourly-waged youngsters either; we started with a manager and were escalated to ""one of the owners"". Neither woman made an attempt to be friendly, let alone apologetic or accommodating in any way.  This lady who was ""one of the owners"" should definitely keep herself exclusively in the back of the house, away from any sort of paying customer.  I have never, as a customer, been treated so poorly or talked to so terribly. And, no, I can assure you, we were not out of line or yelling or making a scene or rude for our part; we just aren't the type. She was plain awful.  Never so much as a shred of an inkling of a hint of an apology or any effort whatsoever.  So, despite all of the rave verbal reviews I have given everyone I know about this place in the past, I will now make sure that everyone we know, meet, work with, or do business with--several of whom work in that building--does not ever drink or dine at R2L.  And, clearly, we will never step foot into the place again either. After leaving, we had an amazing meal with mind-blowing service at DEVON SEAFOOD. Go there instead!",0
3,"I fell in love with Three Muses after looking at Yelp reviews and the restaurant's website. I feel that the website led me to believe it was a more formal tablecloth kind of place and I was a bit surprised when I arrived.  I could care less about tablecloths, just a minor observation as a direct result of the website.When we arrived 20 minutes early for our 6pm Tuesday evening reservation we were greeted by the hostess and immediately informed that no matter what, there is a very strict policy that we would only have the table for 1.5 hours and that if we wanted to enjoy the music after that, we would have to go to the bar. I completely understand why this is their policy, but early on a weeknight when the restaurant is more than half empty it is a bit rude to start with the policy. Plus, what if our meal had taken longer than 1.5 hours? Are you booted to the bar for dessert?Anyway, onto the food...below is a list of the items we ordered any any commentary:-Italian baked Mac & Cheese-I LOVE every kind of cheese possibly imaginable and I was so excited for this dish. When it arrived the pasta was a little too firm and the flavor was extremely bland.  My friends and I barely ate a quarter of the dish. I would never order that again.-Seared Scallops-I didn't eat them but my friends thought they were scrumptious.-Bacon wrapped blue cheese stuffed dates-these were incredible. For three of us we got the large order and though they were amazing, I kind of wish we got the small order only because they were so rich. A good kind of rich. I would order these again.-Beer-Braised Kurobuta Pork Belly-I thought these were really bland, too. I wouldn't order them again.-Steak & Cake-I only at the steak. I was told the crab cake was amazing and one of the best my friend ever had. The steak was awesome and so tender and flavorful.-Ms. Moon's Bulgogi Rice Bowl-This item didn't seem to fit in as well with the other items on the menu but don't let it stop you. It was very very yummy and I would absolutely order it again if I went back. It was a hearty portion and the bowl was basically all but licked at the end to eat it all.-Cardamon Panna Cotta (Ponchatoula Strawberry, Pistachio Biscotti)-I am not a huge panna cotta fan but my friend is and he loved it. I thought it was pretty good when I tried it but have no frame of reference with which to provide any more feedback. -Fluffernutter Pie (Bruleed Marshmallow, Salted Peanuts)-I was intrigued by this option and ordered it. I was underwhelmed and barely at any.-Warm Chocolate Cream Cheese Brownie (Malted Vanilla Ice Cream, Cherry)-per our waitress' recommendation we substituted the vanilla ice cream for brandied butter pecan ice cream and boy was she right. This was AMAZING. I loved the ice cream the most out of all elements of the three desserts. The brownie was tasty though I am not a huge chocolate fan.The live music was nice and the atmosphere was okay. I have a feeling later on a weekend it would be a lot more lively and fun (and packed).",1
5,Sarah is amazing. I had a great night singing with the red piano and having fantastic drinks. Come here for a break from shopping or just passing by. This bar is great the people are friendly & Amazing.  Definitely coming again! Thank you l!,2
3,"I came here Saturday night with the wifey with high hopes of finding our go to sushi place. Unfortunately I think our search must continue. A deeper dive into the rating would show two and a half stars for the sushi and four and a half stars for the service. We each got the Sixers Roll and a regular roll. As much as I appreciate the roll names referencing my favorite past time (being a long suffering Philadelphia sports junkie) the flavor was just a bit underwhelming. The regular roll on the other hand was extremely fresh, the white tuna melted in my mouth and their spicy sauce was to die for. Our waitress wasn't that great and forgot our appetizers and our drink requests however each time she failed to come through for us one of the other waiters would ask us if everything was ok despite the restaurant being packed and you could tell that everyone took a lot of pride in making sure all the patrons had a good experience. I would probably go back from take out and I wish them all the luck in the world. I may try them again in a few months to see if they have made any new innovations.",1
4,"[English review below]Die chinesische Küche ist nicht auf Platz 1 meiner Heißhunger-Favoriten, aber hin und wieder lasse ich mich dann doch dazu hinreißen.Das Restaurant ist groß, und auffällig war direkt, dass die Kellner alle gegen meine Erwartungen fast ausschließlich nicht-chinesisch-stämmig sind, was dem ganzen einen Hauch Multi-Kulti verleiht, obwohl es sich um ein chinesisches Restaurant handelt. Die chinesischen Mitarbeiter bereiten das Essen in der Küche zu, was zum Authentizitätswert des Essens definitiv beiträgt.Die Bedienung war sehr flott und zuvorkommend und konnte sich alle Einzelheiten unserer Bestellung ohne Notizzettel merken (Respekt!). Das Essen war gut.Guter Laden; kann man nicht viel falsch machen.Chinese food usually is not on top of my cravings-list, but every now and then it's fine.The restaurant is quite big. One thing that jumped out to me is that the waiting staff was almost exclusively non-Chinese, at least as far I could see. This makes the restaurant seem very multicultural despite of the Chinese setting and nature of the restaurant. I was told that the Chinese staff is responsible for making the food which makes the food experience seem very authentic.The waiters were very quick and could memorize all details of our order without writing them down (respect!). The food was good.All in all a solid choice; you can't go wrong with it.",2
5,This place is a favourite of mine in the Fairmount/Francisville/Temple area. Got the turkey goat cheese baguette sandwich and the lady had the Philly baguette sandwich (lox and cream cheese w/ tomato). Food was delicious. Iced tea and iced chai latte were both amazing as well. Cute outdoor seating. Everything was super clean and tidy and the staff was super friendly. Highly recommended for a late breakfast or light lunch,2
5,"I grabbed breakfast with a friend early one Saturday morning and Henry's was such a delightful little nook. We were greeted warmly and had a nice long chat with the barista. The food was exceptional and was just the right amount of food, not too much or too little. This place is where you want to be on a slow weekend morning.",2

1,"I usually enjoy PF Chang's, but had never ordered from the Plymouth Meeting location for lunch. I probably won't be ordering from this location again (curb side pick up). I ordered the lettuce wraps, every piece of lettuce was brown and slimy. We ordered soy sauce, hot mustard, chop sticks, etc. and did not receive.  My colleague called this location to complain, the manager he spoke with said he would remove the wraps from bill, but we had paid cash. Also stated he would send a gift card, it's been two weeks and still did not receive.  After spending $45.00 for a basic lunch, plus a tip to the person who brought it to the car, one would expect a bit of a response from the management.  I chose PF Chang's as a nice treat for lunch, as a job well done for one of my employees, how embarrassing that it was so terrible. I would have been better off ordering from McDonald's.",0
3,"The beer is great and so is the atmosphere. The service leaves something to be desired. My husband ordered a beer and got it. He ordered a 2nd and did not ever get it from the server. It was a big group of people but still. At the end of the night the server is settling up and says you had 2 right, and he said he never received the 2nd. She said something about being out the money so he said fine just charge me. When she came back with the bill he signed and then realized she had actually charged him for 4 beers. He was trying to be nice so she wouldn't be in trouble and it backfired.",1
4,"Cheu has really come into its own. When I was last here half a year ago, I was less-than-impressed, but this time, the staff was friendlier and the ramen was close to perfect.We came for a late lunch, minutes before they were supposed to close at 3pm. The waiter still good-naturedly accommodated us, providing fast and attentive service. The noodles were chewy, and whereas last time they were a little clumpy, this time, they were perfect. The broth was not too salty and somehow managed to be full flavored and (refreshingly) light at the same time. The meat was meltingly tender, though a little broken-up for my tastes, and the soft-cooked egg was perfect.We also ordered a special grapefruit juice, whose tart flavor complimented the ramen and served nicely as a palate cleanser.After eating ramen, I often fall into a sodium stupor and feel mildly ill for at least half a day, but after Cheu ramen, I felt pleasantly full. The attentive service and delicious ramen made for a much-improved experience.",2
5,"Best tortelloni I've ever had! The cream walnut sauce was my pregnancy craving, if I could afford it I would eat it every night! Charming atmosphere, great for a special night out.",2
1,New to town and tried several in town but no availability on a Sunday. This place was open when I drove by so I stopped and they had a opening after 20 min wait. Pedicure was ok but gel nails horrible. Looked like fat marshmallow nails and so bumpy. Went to another salon few days later. Run down older salon. Needs lots of improvements especially learn how to do nails. Paid extra for opi nail polish instead of old nail polish they had as a selection. Waste of money and time.,0
4,"We stayed for several days and pretty much liked the room. It was hard to find the hotel but we eventually found it. The hotel was in a handy place to visit the aquarium and places downtown. The room was nice, up on the 10th floor, with a great view and a neat ride up the elevators. The nicest part was the free cocktails and snack during happy hour. It helped mellow us out. The overall ambience of the place says this is a place for business people. Travelers may feel a bit out of place especially dressed in shorts but no one really cares. I never like paying extra for wi-fi. The food in the hotel was average.",2
5,"Back in my hay-day, I was a pretty built dude. I used to play lacrosse. (Sure, I rode the bench, but I still practiced like a winner.) I used to strength train with a former Romanian World Cup soccer player who looked eerily like John Travolta from Pulp Fiction on many, many steroids. (True story; 2006 was a weird year for me.) I used to eat right, drink plenty of water, and take all my essential vitamins. I was young, virile, and full of energy, ready to live a long and eventful life free of prescription medications.And then I discovered beer.Years of the sauce coupled with limited time for exercise (Damn you, soul-crushing job!) made me into a pretty average, pretty chunky little twenty-something. Recently, I decided to do something about it. I began researching the plethora of gyms scattered throughout our fair city, only to discover that waiting tables could never afford me any of them. I heard great things about some of the bigger chains (*cough* SWEAT *cough*) but I simply could not afford their monthly rates. Then an angel in the form of a buddy from work told me about an incredible deal in Northern Liberties. Given how much I missed being in shape, I had to check it out, and I did just that.I've been going 4 times a week ever since. Now, before we talk about the machines, the size of the place, or the classes, let's head off on another path. If you (yes, you) are a follower of my few reviews on here, you may have noticed a theme: I have a secret love for personality displayed in the staff of the spots I frequent. (If you noticed, gold star for you. If not, accept it as absolute truth and carry on reading.) Anyhow, the first thing you notice upon entering City Fitness is the staff. And this staff has definite personality. Everyone smiles. Everyone greets you. If they remember you from the day before, they let you know. If they saw you doing a weird exercise, they ask you about it. Here's the important part, kiddies: THEY MAKE YOU FEEL WELCOME. One of the biggest problems I've encountered in the gyms I've attended in the past has been a general feeling of indifference emanated by the workers. They didn't care whether or not I was there, and I was therefore usually too intimidated or put off to ask them for assistance. Often, this little indifference is what caused me to cancel my membership. Somehow, I don't foresee that happening at City Fitness.The gym itself is huge. A converted warehouse, it has a little bit of everything. The main room consists of the weight section (combination of free weights, benches, and varying machines), the cardio section (50-something pieces of cardio equipment, each with their own LCD TV attached), a stretching/aerobic section (that could admittedly be bigger), and the smoothie bar, which boasts some of the best original recovery shakes I've ever had. They even create specialty recipes for the holidays! Trust me, you're sorry you missed the Thanksgiving Pumpkin Pie shake.Aside from the main room, City Fitness also has dedicated spinning and yoga rooms, each adorned appropriately, as well as a multi-purpose room used for many of the classes offered.Wait, did he just say classes? Yeah, he did. CF has a lot of them. They offer the traditional fare, like the aforementioned yoga and spinning, as well as some more cutting edge classes, like kettle bells and core-centric bridal bootcamps. (Not my cup o' tea, but hey) Different trainers handle different classes, each according to their own personal specialty, and from what I've seen, they kick your ass.Now, that last sentence implies that I don't actually take the classes offered. I don't, and the reason for that is because they cost extra money when added to your monthly membership. Ah, the catch... Actually, most things at CF add a few dollars to your membership fee to utilize fully. Classes, towel service, and locker rentals all increase your very reasonable starting fee and make it... still incredibly reasonable. Seriously, I've done the math, and even if I were to add the fee for taking classes to my membership, I'd be paying less than a basic membership at Sweat. That, friends, is superb.So, if you've been following along, you've come to realize that City Fitness is a large, friendly wellness center with a little bit of everything for everyone that won't break the bank and is easy to get to. (It's literally 40 paces from the Spring Garden El stop.) The question is, with this information in hand, why the hell aren't you there yet? When you do go, look for me. I'll be the guy lost in his own reflection in the giant mirrors.",2
1,"Wasn't an exceptional experience. Wife is a diabetic, so she attempted to avoid the ingredients that would cause issues.  So she went the ""steamed"" route.  The grill hadn't been cleaned between courses, and there was a palatable taste that just seemed incorrect.  All in all, we won't be going back.",0
2,The veggies were boiled. Boiled! There was too much balsamic syrup on the not fresh fish - to mask the not fresh fish.,0
5,"I travel to New Orleans very frequently and usually stay closer to the French Quarter at other Marriott properties but I decided to stay at the Renaissance in the arts district because of the close proximity to the WW2 museum and my expectations were far exceeded for this stay. Overall, the hotel was AMAZING and the staff was very gracious and friendly, specifically, the night supervisor, Mandy Smith, went above and beyond her pay grade to make out this visit in the FIVE STAR category. Will I be back? Yes!!",2
5,Absolutely delicious for lunch and dinner. Charming atmosphere and great service. Food is fresh and flavorful.,2
5,"This is what I've been waiting for!!! Finally a good wing spot in Madison. I just tried it for the first time and was super impressed! It's clean with awesome aviation themed decor.The wings were big, tasty, and fresh. I tried 4 flavors all of which were great. The seasoned fries were out of this world and you could see the entire process of prep from the table. Nice beer selection as well. The cook came out to the table to check on things and was very friendly. The prices are on par with most wing spots but their product is hands down better, I will definitely be back!",2
2,"We went to Baileys' Range for the first time this last Wednesday.The restaurant has a decent atmosphere. The ceiling has old stuff hanging from it with a modern architectural flare.Going upstairs I noticed the steps were caked in old compact dirt and grime, it reminded me of a set of dorm stairs. It's a pretty old building but they could have refinished it better.The bathroom upstairs was in decent condition. But, they hadn't dusted in some time and there was quite a bit of dust caked on the water pipes and top of door frame etc.We sat upstairs at a table overlooking the street. Decent view.We started off the meal with a pitcher of their ""boozy"" lemonade for 30 something dollars. I can guarantee there wasn't much ""boozy"" in it. Tasted good but order something else if you want something with alcohol in it.On to the food.It took at least a half hour to get food for 6 people and when we ordered the place was less than half full.The Burger meat had flavor but was dry. For $11 for the burger alone I would expect better.The Chips and sauces were pretty good but small portions.Overall a Meh experience. I won't go back and won't recommend the place to anyone else. In my opinion, they are trying to be an upscale hip burger joint with small portions with a high price tag but the flavor doesn't live up to the expectation.",0
4,A must go for happy hour if you want quality oysters (75 cents otherwise about double that price). The salad Luke's creamy dressing was also nice. This won't seem like a burger place but get a burger and fries- you will thank me later.,2
3,"Mr. Levow discovered a technicality that successfully supressed and had the ""breath-alyzer"" tossed-out as evidence. Although the Prosecutor was reluctant to consider any other objections they were willing to accept the minimum consequences . . the alternative would be to go to trial and WIN the case on constitutional violation grounds (. . but alas . .no money and no guarantees of total success) My friend's decision was to save the money for the insurance surcharges and take the Prosecutor's minimum offer. (NO, it wasn't me , . . honestly . . It was a friend of mine.)DON'T DRINK AND DRIVE!  Use the money you'll save on a downpayment on a house , new yacht or a round-the-world cruise.",1
2,"Went there for an early dinner on a Sunday. We left disappointed with the food and service. Originally, we were impressed by the reviews on Yelp and we had passed it a couple of times when we were dining in that area before. I was actually looking forward to dining here...when we arrived, we were seated quickly. There was one other table with customers but they were just leaving. The staff was standing at the bar watching/cheering a game on a tv over the bar. Our server was friendly but seemed distracted. We ordered the crawfish dip, a couple of beers, buttermilk chicken sandwich, mac n cheese, and the chocolate cake for dessert. The appetizer took about 20 mins. to arrive...they did eventually come out to tell us something was wrong with the oven and they would remove it from our check out of courtesy. We were then served our meals and about 15 mins later, our appetizer arrived. The buttermilk chicken sandwich: the chicken itself was soggy and/or very greasy, the kale or greens on the sandwich were soggy from being soaked in honey or grease maybe?? It looked unpleasant. Normally, greasy wouldn't be so bad with a nice crunch. This didn't have that. The mac n cheese had a good smokey flavor from the bacon. The crawfish dip had good flavor as well...very cheesy and tangy. The bread it came with was toasted and slightly burnt around the edges. It was hard to chew or cut. Before we were asked if we wanted dessert, our server brought us the check. Maybe he wanted us to leave so that they can all continue watching the game without interruption, but it was strange. We asked if we can order dessert and he took our order. The chocolate cake was dense...a huge portion that was good for sharing. Not sure if the cake was stale or just hard from being refrigerated but it was hard to cut with a knife. I actually thought it might be frozen but it wasn't.  It had good flavor though. So, it wasn't a horrible experience but with all the dining options in and around Philly, we will not be returning even if it was an off night for them. Sorry! :(",0
4,"I am giving this bar four stars because not only is it my go to bar most nights, but also because of all the BS the bartenders and workers put up with there. The drinks here are not bad, average priced, however some nights they are a bit watered down. Overall its a good bar, if you are a fan of REALLY loud music, go on the weekends, if you are not a fan, like me, stick to weekdays. Also stay away from the bathrooms, they are a wreck. Overall though, good service and nice bartenders !",2
5,I ordered mix veggie pizza and it was fantastic.  Veggies were flavorful and the crust was thin and delicious.  Highly recommend!,2
5,Its nice to see Thai's style ice cream here in Tampa. Its worth the wait just don't come during the peak time. Located  near USF's campus and the price is pretty okay. I will be back.,2
5,"Best local pizza place around!   The pizza is delicious and fresh.  We've tried the Hot, Mild, Garlic Parmesan, and BBQ wings and all of them are fantastic.  This is a carry-out place, so don't expect to bring the family in, but there are a couple of small tables if you're just running in to get a Stromboli or something for lunch.  I've tried the Stromboli and the calzone and i prefer the calzone but that's just my preference.   As for the pizza, we've tried a few kinds and all have been great, but we usually just pick pick up a large mushroom for the $7.99 carry-out special.   Staff is nice and friendly and they're usually pretty quick.",2
1,Wow new ownership and they don't care about customers that's for sure.dont go here for lunch or if you are in a hurry.I think this location won't last long with the attitude they have here ...,0
1,"Do Not Come to this Place! The shrimp was disgusting you can even taste the dirt inside it. It took the 20 min to serve it. And took them another 20 min for the gumbo. Most horrible is no service at all! None! I sit in the bar for 10 min no one serves me! Even after I ask the bar tender many times he took my order with a shitty face, I got no water no Fock knife no nothing the guy next to me even yelled at them to get service. I asked the woman from the kitchen sending gumbo for water she said as kinda surprised and said"" you want water?"" Oh yeah should I is she dumb? The bar tender was busy counting money and cold as as ice, the other guy grilling oyster is ridiculous as well. And oh boy the food is way over priced for the poor quality.And the bar tender dare to have the face asking for 20% tip.To the manager you should first fire the bar tender and then fire the chef, probably in the end fire yourself for hiring such horrible people!",0
5,"I love Icesmile! They are really new to the Tampa area and they already have a huge following. For around the same price as frozen yogurt, you get to try Thai style rolled ice cream. This store is so trendy, it feels like it should be in New York City. they have a ton of different flavor and topping options. They also offer discounts quite often. The only suggestion I have is that they add more seating inside!",2
5,Excellent gelato and sorbets.  You NEED to try this!  Conveniently located on the way back from the beach or after a trip to the Taco Bus.,2
3,"I had extremely high hopes for this place but alas it did not meet them.  I can only speak for the donuts and those did not impress me.  With the warm donuts, I could not discern a difference between the two I tried, although they were different colors.  The ""fancy"" donuts were not particularly interesting to me.  The consistency was ok and the flavors were not very prominent.  I tried each flavor; the caramel banana was the best.  The donuts here are better than chains but not nearly as delicious as I had hoped.Ultimately, to me, this is not a donut destination.  I think I have been thoroughly  spoiled by the awesomeness that is Donut Plant in NYC.  Take the train, go there.  I still want to try the fried chicken!",1
2,I didn't really like my sandwich I got here. I got the jalapeño cheese bread and it was tasteless and dry. I could tell it was old. Also I got tomatoes and cucumbers which were mush because they were overripe. Usually they're a lot better than this but today wasn't it. The staff is very friendly though.,0
2,"A group of us purchased a Groupon for Gateway Lanes that included an hour of bowling, 2 pizza's and pop. Very much looking forward to it, we went down one weekday evening, and it was moderately busy. No problems at all with bowling - shoes were as you would expect, lanes were working, we had a good time. When our hour was up, we approached the counter to ask about the Pizza's.The woman we spoke to had to be persuaded to help us and when asked if one of the Pizza's could have 1/2 with no cheese, what  resulted was a very rude back and forth about whether it was in fact an allergy or a preference. The woman got progressively more upset, eventually raising her voice to a near yell. Taken aback, we asked to speak with a manager, which turned out to be her. Another employee intervened, and kindly put through the order for pizza.When the pizza arrived (sans cheese, as requested) it was unremarkable, but edible.The whole evening was enjoyable with the exception of the nearly comical over-reaction to our pizza request. Had she just said ""sure"", the review would have been given 4 stars. (Decent bowling, so-so pizza).",0
4,"This is always my go-to Wawa, less than a mile from my house. Probably one of the only places around (besides McDonald's) that is open 24/7. Gas is open 24/7 as well. All the food is the same in Wawa to me, but it is a pretty big store compared to other ones around the area I've been to. The only thing I don't like is that sometimes their ATMs do not work.",2
1,"Ignorant bartender. Took forever for him to wait on you at a table on a Sunday afternoon, not even during football season.  Lesson learned. Never have a bartender wait on you for food.  Number 1, they don't want to do it, but also, they don't know the menu or anything about the kitchen when you ask a question. This is a typical suburban blue collar and millennial underwhelming establishment to watch Sports in with a pint of flat Budweiser. It is perfect for blue collars who swear that walk in dressed like they just finished a 10 hr day either painting, fixing drains, or laying down planks, or up on a roof. After 10 or 11pm the DB millennials roll in, espec on weekends.",0
5,I've only had the rare steak pho here but it was the best pho I've ever tasted.  I will definitely make this my regular pho place. The service was great too. Very fast and everyone was very friendly!,2
4,"There's no doubt that Fulton Alley is a great addition to the city. It's nice inside and the staff is very friendly. It's not a true bowling alley though. Just like the fancy bowling alleys I've been to in Dallas, the pins are attached to strings, thus preventing mechanical failures that traditional alleys deal with often. It limits the 'bowling' experience. . But the place is cool. Check it out.",2
4,"The chorizo tacos are amazing!!! We also tried the carne asada and shrimp tacos, amazing as well. The potato taquitos had great flavor and the service was excellent!",2
5,"I have been a tennis member since 2007 and with the clubs careful guidance and training, I was able to vastly improve my tennis game.  Advancing from a complete beginner (2.5 level player) to today where I play at the 4.0 level.  The staff are fun and helpful and provide an enthusiastic, professional approach at all times.  Penn Oaks Tennis provides the complete package, from group and individual lessons & clinics, to drop-in point plays .... for all age groups and levels.  They also offer racquet re-stringing & racquet buying advice and options, so really a one-stop shop for all things tennis.",2
1,We got there 30 plus minutes before the show expecting to enjoy a drink or two and some food before the show...were told a server would be right over to help us...no one ever came...so no drinks or food...seats were comfortable but no service took a lot out of the experience.,0
5,This is a review as someone who plays board games and paints miniatures. This is a huge shop with some of the best prices in town. The selection of games is great. No Privateer Press miniatures or Malifaux and their GW is only some new stuff (though I am sure you can order through the shop). Their X-Wing selection is huge. The board game selection is big and literally wraps around the shop. Can be a bit intimidating checking out the games in the section where games are being played but it can be fun to watch other games being played. The staff is helpful but can seem absent since the shop is so huge. Lots of room to play games and meet up with folks to play.,2
4,"Rumfish is as I expected,A bit overpriced for what you get and sort of like a Hard Rock, Planet Hollywood, Rainforest Cafe thing...You pay for the fish tankMenu lights up, but it's one page of overpriced entree'sB- to B+ food",2
4,"Parking (even on a Thursday) was a pain but as long as you're ok with a little walk, it's doable. The service was spectacular. I love how in locals places staff is usually honest and laid back. The bartender/waiter extraordinaire told me he thinks mules are a joke of a cocktail and so I steered away from the Pear-a-mule and went with the good old margarita.  Cocktail-wise you really can't go wrong. We started with the chips and guac which was delicious, fresh and flavorful. We also ordered the sweet potato wedges with serrano aioli----highly recommended. I had the chimichurri sliders (they caught my eye for some reason). I seemed like and off combination but the flavors worked together and I was quite happy with my choice. (Side note: ladies, you won't be able to eat this gracefully---date tip.) Overall I'm super impressed with the service and quite happy with the food and value. It wasn't crowded when we were there but I can imagine it feels---and gets-- crowded very easily. That's just about the only downside. This is definitely good for a casual little stop with some good drinks,  some interesting food and a nice cantina feel.",2
4,"I haven't stayed at the JW, but I've been twice to benefits at this hotel. The first, for Sheltering Wings, actually was the first event held there. I went to a gala last night for Gleaners, and was equally impressed both times. The staff is wonderful -- guiding you to your location in a way that isn't overbearing -- and the banquet space is lovely. The food is also tasty. I love the view of Victory Field, too, from the third floor. This really is a nice hotel for Indianapolis.",2
3,"My experience at The Mustard Seed was quite varied. I want to start off with the good parts:1. The Service- so friendly. I know the service industry is a tough one to be in, and our server did a great job and even offered us a complimentary dessert for our meal mishap (see below). 2. The Food- delicious! The Fried Mac & Cheese are a don't-miss! They are also served with the most delicious aioli that you should save for the rest of your meal. The not so good parts:1.The Meal Mishap- I ordered the Fried Green Tomato BLT but also explained that I don't eat bacon because I'm a vegetarian, and asked to have the bacon left off. I ordered this knowing that sometimes mistakes happen and blah blah blah hoping that there wouldn't be any bacon on my sandwich. But... alas! The sandwich came out and had bacon on it. Cue my body starting to sweat, and my cheeks starting to blush because I'm sorry that I have to send the food back... but I don't eat bacon! I tell our server about the mistake and she apologizes and brings it back to the kitchen...Then I have a chat with my boyfriend about hoping that she doesn't bring it back after just having the kitchen pick the bacon off and serving it. **More intense anticipation-sweating**. The sandwich comes back and... there was an inch-size chunk of bacon still sticking out of the side, but the main parts had been picked off. I brought to our servers attention what had happened, and that I would just like a to-go box because I could find someone else to eat it. Then, she profusely apologized and had the kitchen actually remake it. The re-made sandwich was fantastic. But, it is still hard for me to rid myself of the lack of respect The Mustard Seed seemingly had/has for dietary restrictions. I ended up a happy customer, but was also a little bummed. I don't know if I will return.",1
4,"I visited the French Press on my most recent trip to Santa Barbara, it was a pleasant establishment compounded with the pleasant company of those I was with, and those at the tables around us. It was very comfortable. The tea I got was fantastic, but it's hard to go wrong with tea. I enjoyed the art on the walls, a specific piece with a masked face that I couldn't dare take my eyes off of. I was intrigued. Perhaps, easily intrigued. Also, I'll be back.",2
2,"My first time and the band soul bus was nice. Why they call themselves soul bus I don't have a clue. They weren't playing soul music but they were playing the blues with some jazzy undertones. Nothing worst than a bunch of white boys in jeans that look like they slept in them. It's like an after thought..they just rolled in hit a few licks after laying on the couch all day look.  They knew they had a show! when is dirty looking tees and jeans part of the act? One cat had on a nice shirt  no stage presence at all.    I was told is was a classy place..NOT more of a old gentleman's club feel and outdated looking. Had the sushi..gag me. I have had better wont order that again if I return to Daddy Jacks. My guy Aaron at Kroger 79th and fall creek makes it better! it's yummy! He's from Thailand if that helps he is a sushi master.  I also tried the buffalo shrimp. Okay I'm thinking these may be what I'm familiar with from my Ann Arbor Michigan experience ..YUCK!  not even close. No batter not even a dusting just 12.50 cent worth of shrimp  thrown in hot sauce. It's beyond laughable..where is the skill in that?

4,"Without a doubt. ....some of the best barbeque I've had this side of Texas.  The meat was smoked so well, you didn't need sauce.  It was offered on the side and the sauces were good too. I also had their collard greens and mac and cheese.  My sister had the smoked wings and she said they were delish. Her cocktail was a Metropolitan that had kick.The staff was friendly and offered a shot that tasted like apple pie. The bar is loaded with tasty treats including Jameson Cask Mates.My sister lives in Texas and I live in California. We were in town for a family funeral but next time we're here,  we'll come back.

5,"Couldn't have asked to work with a better painting company!We decided to put our rental property up for sale, after speaking to the realtor we decided to hire someone to paint the house. We had Pamella & Sameh arrive to our property to do the estimate, they were both so friendly and were great about educating us on why certain things were important and explained their process and why they choose to do things the way they do. We learnt so much (which help when we had another company quote the same job). After getting a few quotes, we decided to work with Blue Nile, they did a great job, were clean and respectful of the space and our timeline (they were finished earlier then expected). They filled in all the holes and dings from 8 years of renters... this wasn't a small task and they did a great job, leaving us able to do more. Once they were done, we did a walk through with them and then they asked us to review the work and let them know if anything thing needed touchup, they'd be happy to come back to fix them. We found one small spot that we thought could us a touch up, they were there promptly and were genuinely happy to do the work to our expectations. The house sold within 5 days of being on the market.",2
3,"When I was reading reviews for this joint it says for ""Just about anything..."" so I thought that they would have some sort of all day menu so they can serve just about anything at anytime of day.  It was our last day in the Clearwater Beach area and my son developed some sort or allergy from insect bites so we took him to urgent care.  As a result we did not get to Kelly's until 3:00 PM.  When they handed us this one page menu I was so surprised to see that there was not much to choose from.  I had my heart set on getting a late breakfast.  My son wanted to eat fish and they only had one fish dish on the menu :-(. I was ready to get up and leave but my husband felt bad because the server was already getting our waters.  We ordered buffalo wings, grouper sandwich, and grilled cheese.  The buffalo wings was good, the grouper sandwich was just ok, the grilled cheese was good too.  The server was really nice and gave me the option of getting both the bbq sauce and ranch dressing for the wings. We ordered a key lime pie, we did not want to leave Florida without having one, it was beautifully presented and tasted good.   If I ever come back I would make sure I go during breakfast",1

1,"Bridal Department very Dismissive. They obviously judge a book by it's cover. If you ever want to feel like Julia Roberts in Pretty Women or just feel invisible take a stop in nordstrom's bridal department. My daughter's  and I were not ignored by 1, or 2, but 3 sales associates! They felt kibitzing among each other was more important than nordstrom's customers. I approached one associate and asked if they had a particular gown that we found on nordstrom's website. She said ""no we don't have that in the store."" Then back to kibitzing with the other 2 biddies. I just gave her the perfect opportunity to ask if we needed any assistance and she blew it! Note there was not 1 other customer in the bridal department. This is Not the customer service that nordstrom's is known for. I find it appalling and extremely unprofessional  This particular department definitely needs customer service training. Unfortunately for them we took our business online and spent $1800 on 2 bridesmaid gowns. Big loss Nordstrom's Bridal department. Your Commission just walked out the door. Thank God your online customer service is on point and extremely helpful. Can't wait to receive the gowns.Shame on you 3 Women! One should NEVER JUDGE a book by it's cover.",0
5,Love this studio! Excellent artists and fair prices! Very clean shop. I have had nothing but great experiences here! Highly recommend!,2
5,Always great food and exceptional service!! I enjoy the food- well prepared and delicious. One of my favorite sushi restaurants. They have a generous appetizer menu and plenty of long rolls and hand rolls from which to choose. The sushi chefs and staff are always friendly and attentive. Food is always fresh and delightful.,2
4,"Im from Metairie, but I live in town south of Guadalajara, Mex. I've been searching for a Mexican restaurant that has the taste and feel of where I live at in Mex... And now I can say that I found that place.....  The tortillas are real and so are the people....  And at a great price...  Si quieres comer  comida de Jalisco ven a este lugar",2
2,"Ate here on memorial day for breakfast. TERRIBLE! The bacon was the only thing edible. My lady had their ""potatoes"" and half a scrambled egg. Literally that small of a portion. The ""potatoes"" were gross, she even had me try them to confirm it wasn't her, yuck! My biscuits and gravy was the smallest portion/price I've ever experienced and i think the lid may have come off the salt when they were making the gravy, ugh! Bacon bloody Mary was good as was the bacon. They didn't have any forks so we had to use plastic, absurd for a business that charges for the name on the front. Customer service was border line non existent and the place wasn't even half full, I'd hate to see what happens to all these kids when they're at capacity.  Don't waste your time unless you're just out for a drink and a piece of bacon.",0
5,"Always a great experience, with a perfect haircut.  The new and easy check in makes things a lot easier. Sasha always takes care of me and does a superb job!",2
5,"This is a review for pet grooming service. I went out of town and had to have my mom babysit my 3 years old westie, and she decided to shave his head bald because the hair was covering his eyes! I was mortified. He looked balder than a bald eagle (only the top half of his head was shaved and nothing else).... no westie should ever have that type of haircut. I can't ever imagine what would happen if I let her babysit my future kid. So I went online and booked an appointment with Katarina. She is amazing and wonderful in every way! Very friendly and patient. One of the best pet groomers there, I would highly recommend her because not only did she do a great job of trimming... what's left of my dog's facial hair but she also made him look super cute and clean.  I was very pleased with the outcome. Will definitely go back to her for future appointments!!!",2
3,The food was ok and the service wasn't bad.  Get the Monster Margarita if you do go and the tequila will take away the bad smell of the place!!,1
4,on top of the ticket price you have to pay 10$ to park Heads up. This place is awesome for what it is. The actors in the house are good. I was legitly spooked in every house except the 3d one the paint was too cool and trippy to be scared lol.its really cool like if i was to be murdered or mutilated it would be in a place like that. dark woods etc. also 7$bud light so of course pre game before hand. theres a house they can touch you in. the actors only grabbed girls/paid no attention to my boyfriend or any guys that i saw lol,2
5,"101 was delightful! Stopped by after working up an appetite running errands in town and we happened to show up during happy hour - two for one drinks (possibly also applies to alcoholic drinks, but we both got boba teas instead)The scallion pancakes were a perfect appetizer. They came out hot, crispy, and a little oily, delicious.The tonkatsu chicken and fried tofu bao were both delicious. All the condiments on their bao make for a sort of savory, sort of sweet flavor combo (cilantro, sweet sauce, and a few other things I don't remember off the top of my head)The popcorn chicken was also excellent. Tiny, very crispy bits of chicken served with rice and a potato salad. I didn't try the potato salad, but heard it was more of a macaroni salad. I highly recommend Taiwan 101. Food is cooked quickly, staff are nice, and everything I've tried so far is absolutely delicious.",2
5,"I can't say enough good things about Fox Fitness.  Becky makes working out challenging but fun and you will see results.  The atmosphere is fun, always a little different to keep you engaged for the best full body workout results.  Becky is very attentive to all individual needs, gives advice and answers questions any time, is always smiling and keeping our momentum going, giving us praise and supporting us all the way through!  I wish I had found Becky and Fox Fitness sooner.  I love how it has changed my health and my attitude!",2
4,"I fell upon this great little pub after a tour at ESP. What a find! Excellent food and interesting beers. The atmosphere was perfect. To the man at the table next to us (Saturday 12/28 about 2pm) with the blue sweater-if your date was not successful, PLEASE look me up!",2
2,"Tried dinner there recently and found the quality is very uneven.While some noodle soup dishes and rice plate dishes are true to authentic Chinese food, others are truly found in only American Chinese restaurants. The duck is very fat and very little meat. The stir fry dishes have weird combo of vegetables that do not go together.And as a typical Chinese restaurant, service does not come with a smile.",0
4,"very good chinese in the heart of Chinatown. Very friendly and quick service without being rushed.  Always a good sign to get a table in the middle of 4 tables of asian families and groups eating a plethora of dishes.  Our family of 4 started with scallion pancakes (only $4) and then each ordered the combo dinners ($10-11) which include soup, very good spring roll, white or fried rice and entree.Would definitely recommend.  Just remember to BYOB if you want a drink with your meal.",2
2,"Food was just about ok. Service very average and slow. Also, charging extra for something as simple as soy sauce is a bit strange when their other condiments were complimentary. Bar staff was good though.",0
1,Wonderful man running it but they only had 2 dishes and they weren't good and very expensive for a plate of mostly rice. I really don't know how they are staying in business.,0
5,"Featuring only Canadian ingredients (over 90% of which are sourced in Alberta and BC), the now 11 week old addition to Edmonton's growing 124 St was not far down on my list to eat. Our reservation was for 7pm last Saturday and when we arrived, it was surprisingly not fully seated! A long bar counter actually allows diners to show up without reservations, something I wish I would have known earlier. Large windows made it feel quite open and as the night went on, the dark interior gave it a very trendy atmosphere.To start, I had my mind set on a Caesar, a truly Canadian drink. I didn't even bother to look at the drinks menu (whoops!) and when I ordered, our server Chris kindly told me they had removed it from the menu. Aperol Spritz then? North 53′s mixologist Brendan Brewster (formerly Woodwork, Manor Bistro), happily accommodated my off menu request. Joe and I decided to order off the a la carte versus the $85 tasting meu (lowered from the original opening $100), although many tables were doing so. There's just something about being able to choose what to eat!The ""Various Beets"" has been on the menu for some time now and that's always a sign that it's a winner. Indeed it was. Beets sourced from Riverbend Gardens, done in a multitude of ways: sorbet, pickled, and dehydrated meringue; layered with a goat's cheese mousse, red wine vinaigrette, candied walnuts, and nasturtium (a watercress-like leaf with a peppery taste). Best presentation ever. And incredibly delicious! The beet meringue was the most intriguing, dehydrated to the point that upon contact with moisture (your mouth), it almost dissolved into a burst of beet flavor. What just happened there?!While I was pondering away on the use of a dehydrator, Joe was trying the duck rillette, which he chose from the menu. Similar to a pate, the Fourwhistle Farm's duck was cooked until tender, shredded and formed, topped with pieces of smoked duck breast, and cherry gelee. Gastriqued cherries along with a cherry and hazelnut puree decorated the rest of the plate. Joe loved the gastriqued cherries and both of us enjoyed the smoked duck breast. More of that, please!Sauteed carrots came on top of pearl barley risotto, finished with the Cheesiry's pecorino stock, freshly shaved perocrino, and watercress. Sprinkled over top was a dehydrated brown butter powder, giving the dish another layer of seasoning.The black cod, sourced from Vancouver Island, was done to perfection and supremely moist. Little neck clams and a clam froth were mixed in with the butternut squash puree and roasted butternut squash, although a different server (not Chris) said they were oysters when he brought it out. I really enjoyed this dish and it's because of dishes like these that I'm always keen on ordering a fish entree instead of another protein. I won't know how it compares to the wild boar or milk fed veal sirloin tip until my next visit!I have learnt that two desserts will always make me happier than one and seeing that we were both 80% full, why not. Chris highly recommended the sunchoke ice cream. This dish is definitely not to be missed! Aside from the creative use of sunchoke, it was placed on a thyme sponge, layered with balsamic vinegar curd and more of the brown butter powder, this time with black malt. The ice cream was very well done, smooth, no crystals of ice and had such a pleasant flavor. The thyme sponge had a... spongey texture. Honestly one of the most interesting things to eat, next to the beet meringue we had earlier. Really starting to wonder what kind of dehydrator they're using back there!Our second dessert was the wild blueberry sorbet, accompanying a goat's milk panna cotta. On the bottom were dried blueberries, roasted rolled oats, and a blueberry tuile to anchor the dish. All components were gorgeous, and overall the dish was very unsweetened, which can be a nice way to end a meal. The tarragon granite might not be for all, especially if you do not enjoy licorice! I didn't even know tarragon had that natural taste, it's always mixed in with other herbs when I've had it.Overall, the meal was one of the best that I've ever had. Points all around for presentation, creativity, and taste! It's like an episode on the Food Network. Not only that, the service was excellent and the kitchen was timely with our plates. Chris was extremely knowledgeable on the menu and its ingredients. I had read from some diners that the atmosphere was quite formal, but not so when we went. Quite relaxed in my opinion but they may have eased up, much like the cost of the plates.",2
4,"Went here for the first time last weekend. Called ahead to try and make a reservation but they only do those for groups of 6 or more. Being a group of 4 we went ahead and went in and were given a wait time of 1 hour and 30 minutes. We chose to wait at their upstairs bar and have some cocktails while we waited for our friends to arrive and enjoyed some cocktails during our wait. I had the cocktail featuring egg whites, and it was very very tasty (compares well to some similar cocktails I've had at Thunderbird). Once we finally were seated the food was all delicious. The crispy wagon wheels that they started us with were amazing, and reminded me of the flavor of bugles. The skirt steak was recommended and after looking at other yelp reviews we had to have that, so we enjoyed it and the order of scallops. The food and drinks were awesome, and the wait time was a little rough but once we got situated at the bar the time flew by.Final note: if you do sit at the upstairs bar next to a door, be forewarned that the door will bump you repeatedly as management and staff access the closet during the night. It becomes more annoying the longer you sit there because it's unavoidable and a terrible design flaw.",2
4,"Great place to take the family. I hope Noboru can keep up this quality level for the long-term, because we love it here!",2
5,"I wish they served a bigger menu of dim sum because it's amazing here! In my opinion, this is the best place for dim sum in reno (CaiE's oriental cafe seems like they serve pre-frozen dim sum). We order in advance and dine in. Whenever I'm craving chicken feet and siu mai, this is the go to. Unless we can go over the hill to Sac. They have a good combo meal. I enjoy their sesame chicken with fried rice. Hubby gets beef and broccoli or shrimp and vegetables. Comes with a nice combo appetizer and/or hot cup of soup.",2
5,"Food and service were great. Ask for Jaclyn Smith. She's a new server and is incredible.  So very attentive and polite.  I promise, it's worth getting Ms. Smith (soon to be Smith, she's engaged i don't know her current last name). The coffee tenderloin is absolutely the best steak I've had and I travel and eat out a lot, it's incredible.",2
5,half-price margarita pitchers on tuesday. i'm so there. the mahi mahi taco is calling my name.,2
2,"Visiting Tampa on work trip and stopped in for a disappointing taco Tuesday. First, the service left much to be desired including reaching over others at the table instead of simply taking one step to deliver food to the ordering person. I love tacos. I didn't think it was possible to go wrong with tacos before this meal. The standard taco with beef tastes exactly like the chicken...not quite sure how two very different meats can have the same taste. The good news is that the tacos were $2 instead of the menu price and the guacamole was amazing & fresh.",0
3,"This is a cool looking new restaurant with friendly service, but the food isn't great.I like the idea of a multicultural menu, so I wanted to try Global A'fare out.  I liked the outdoor eating area.  I also thought there were a lot of good looking cocktails on the menu.Our waiter was very nice and enthusiastic about the menu, but he wasn't very good.  He forgot or misheard some of our orders.We started with the global tasting tour.  We had the prosciutto, the hard salami and the tyrokafteri.  The tyrokafteri was pretty good.  I would pass on the meats.  Both were extremely salty.  I would call the prosciutto closer to baked ham than a cured delicacy.  For my main course, I tried the meatballs.  The meatballs had the same super salty ""prosciutto"" in them, so they were insanely salty.  The marinara sauce was bland.  My husband had the pastitsio, which he did not like.  Our friend had the limoncello chicken which he really enjoyed.For dessert, we had the fried baklava with ice cream.  That was not very good baklava.The cocktails we had were pretty darned tasty.  I recommend the cucumber and lime gimlet.  The sangria was also very tasty.I doubt I'll return.  The drinks are good, but too much of the food was mediocre.",1
2,"My husband and I had been looking forward to trying this place out by was quite underwhelmed with our experience. We got one of each of the fancy donut flavors which are currently chocolate old fashioned, s'mores, peanut butter malt, key lime pie, pineapple brown sugar, and blueberry lemonade. The first three (on top) were OK, the last three (on the bottom) were not good at all. The icing flavors just didn't mix well together with the actual donut. For $2 per donut for donuts I was not impressed with at all, I would not get donuts from here again. Save yourself some money and go to Beilers for better donuts that are only $1 per. The fact that the store is called ""Federal DONUTS"" and only had six ""fancy donut"" flavors and three ""sprinkled sugar"" flavors was also far from impressive. I hear the fried chicken here is good so maybe one day we'll come back to check that out. But definitely not the donuts.",0
3,"I find it hugely ironic that WF is trying to reposition itself as a 'value' food store right now when others (i.e. Trader Joe's up the street) have been doing that for years.  For value, go elsewhere.  For pretty food, lovely store displays and a feeling of smugness, check out Whole Foods.Despite my snark, I have to admit that it's nice to see an enormous, clean and well stocked yuppie market in Reno finally.  Now that this town has been rated by National Geographic as a top outdoors place to live in, it needs the retail to support that (and I don't mean another REI).  For myself, I'm too cheap to look seriously at this place for my regular shopping needs, but for lunch and the odd stopover, it's awesome.   Beautiful produce, drool inducing cheese selections and a bakery that would break my budget if I bought everything that struck my fancy.Plus it's proximity to the freeway (for those of us who do our shopping based on distance from the 395 or 80) makes it an ideal stop to/from the airport.",1
5,Han dynasty is amazing as advertised. A bunch of my friends always brag about it and I had to go there. The dan dan noodles are amazing. They're so addictive that I've been craving them since I left the building. Definitely going to make it a regular place to go to on my list,2
3,"After the gym today, my theatre sister and I decided to visit this establishment for lunch. I ordered the turkey melt fully dressed with Lays potato chips-no drink. Upon receiving our food, we noticed several things wrong: I have to admit that when it comes to food and what the food comes on, I tend to be a neat freak. My plate had little specs of brown on it. I consider it disrespectful to serve food on a dirty white plate. It made me very apprehensive about eating it. Regardless, it was the busiest time of day (noon) but I'm sure they were pressing for time. Perhaps this review translates into more of a tip: avoid popular healthy-kick restaurants at busy hours. Still, when everything is up to par, enjoy a sandwich and a spud with extra green onions! You're welcome loves!",1
5,Awesome place to visit Grants home is full of history with the old out buildings the tour guide was very helpful and knew everything you could ever ask its for sure worth the time even more if you take the time to go to Grants farm across the street,2
1,"This sushi restaurant was horrible.  First, when we walked in we were POINTED to our table, not actually walked to it.  No one smiled at us, and we were completely ignored throughout our stay.  We had 3 different people serving us, so we had no idea who our waitress was.  No one explained to us that the only option at ZEN was all you can eat, so when we ordered only 4 small items and received a bill for $56.00, we were astonished.  The waitresses simply ""dumped"" the food to our table....No smiles, no asking who the food was for.  I had to get up from our table to ask for our bill, as we were completely ignored and sat there forever waiting for someone to serve us.  I ended up complaining to one of the waitresses who laughed throughout the few minutes I complained.  DO NOT go to this restaurant....Overall a HORRIBLE experience!!!",0
5,"Owned by Peppermill and decorated with lots of neon glitz, the Coffee Shop and the Deli both have the same food as the Peppermill in Reno but at half the cost.  Join the ""Birthday Club"" in the casino.  They give you a $10 food credit to join and send you $25 food credit for you birthday.  NO SLOT CLUB CARD.  Just sign up for the Birthday Club.  First meal there was the BEST Pot Roast I've ever had and since I had joined the Club, it ended up being FREE.  The Deli serves excellent Corned Beef and Pastrami piled high like at the Peppermill, but instead of $14.95 the EXACT same sandwich is $5.95 at Western Village.   A GREAT FIND.  In Sparks just off I80 behind Sierra Sid's.  Take McCarran exit off I80 and go NORTH one block and make a right.",2
5,"This is the place for authentic Indian street food. I've been here multiple times ordering different things ranging from bhel puri, pav bhaji, vada pav, deconstructed samosa and aloo tikki, dabeli, kulfi and more. Everything was made exceptionally well.I regret not having found this place sooner.",2
4,"I'm not one to watch the chef shows so celebrity chefs don't do me. That said, the food was creative and cutting edge. We had the  four course tasting menu. The dishes have many flavors that reveal themselves to you one at a time which is fun. Small portions, but enough food. I had a wonderful glass of Argentinian wine which was fun. My only disappointment is that they only change the four course menu seasonally so no real incentive to go back again until next season unless I ante up for the six course menu which is just a little too pricey with a kid in college.  Wonderful service. Really top notch which is becoming more and more rare these days.",2
4,"This place is the oldest Italian restaurant in America which was very impressive so thought we would give it a try.. the inside looked like someone's grandma's dining room..floral wallpaper and floral tiles adorned the walls... super old school! We ordered clam casino, sautéed mussels in red sauce, veal parm and eggplant parm.The service was weird...there was one particular server who stood out the most..he was rude. He took our order and walked away. When the food came out, he told customers to get out of his way who were getting situated at their table and slammed the plates on our table...maybe this is how they serve their guest here since the 1900s, either way, the food was good and we didn't care.",2
5,Food and music were both fabulous. Our large group ordered a wide variety of dishes and we were very happy with all of them.,2
3,"Very busy place, with a nice out door waiting area, ordered red sangria and honestly it sucked who puts cinnamon in  sangria and if that's common they put way to much,  basicly it was crap wine with cinnamon in it, on a better not the crab guacamole was amazing, super fresh and a nice amount of crab inside, we also had shrimp/crab  empenada's very good..... I had the carne asada, was cooked very well but sauce was bland as well as the rice, mom had a steak dish that had way to much cumin in it, horrible overwhelming spice that was all you could taste. Atmosphere is nice with the exception of every guy wearing a dry fit shirt and  cargo shorts. Wait staff was professional and quick to serve. I guess I would try it again to get a better experience",1
5,Words can not express how happy I am and how wonderful my wedding day was with the flowers these ladies put together for my wedding. They took what I was dreaming of having on my special day and made it a reality. Me and my husband could not be happier. I know who I'll be hinting him to buy flowers for me from in the future.,2
5,"Exceptional Greek food. Authentic and well done. Greatly situated in the sponge docks of Tarpon Springs and they handled my party of 15 well. Our server Nonda was very kind and most certainly very Greek! :) The food was well done, especially the classic Greek salad, pork souvlaki, and gyro. The seafood was great too! The octopus was tender with a great char, and the snapper was very flavorful. My only regret was that I didn't have time for the bakery!",2
5,I love living here! I love being close to all that downtown st pete has to offer but still being far enough to the busier parts of downtown so I can still go home and relax and have quiet time. The apartment looks just like the pictures and the grounds are kept nice. Parking can sometimes be annoying but I don't find it to be a major issue. If you plan to move here I definitely recommend working with Crystal.  She will greet you with a smile from the moment you walk in and will be there every step of the way from picking the perfect apartment to making sure you are still happy once you have moved in. I wouldn't be as happy as I am with Fusion 1560 if it wasn't for her!,2
5,"I don't know why everyone is hatin' on this place. Microwaved pasta? That's what you'd compare pasta from Boston Pizza or Sbarro with.But anyways, I'm not a huge pasta enthusiast - I never really crave it. But my boyfriend does and whenever he mentions this place I get a pasta hankering. I usually order the Borsetti (I think that's what it's called) and it always tastes delicious and fresh. All the salads and soups I've had there are great as well.The service can be a bit slow sometimes but that's hardly worth taking a star away.",2
5,The girls behind the counter are so delightful and nice. Treat you nicer than your family!Help you get what you like! I also got a grilled cheese. It's nice to try the local delights. Stevie Nicks playing overhead. My grilled cheese is a work of art. I'm already excited af. The cheese was real not velveeta. Very very beautiful and comforting. It came with sea salted potato chips. The ice tea was made fresh. The taste is refreshing & exceedingly delish. Free WiFi too... so you can Yelp!,2
4,"I've been visiting NOLA, and Back to the Garden was one of the places listed that is great for vegetarians. I really enjoyed my lunch here. Had the red bean chili with TVP, salad, and corn chips, and a cup of fruit salad.I loved the chili, it was a bit bland, but very good. My friend put hot sauce all over hers. Salad, fruit and chips were fresh and good.I loved the basic atmosphere, and enjoyed watching the folks working in the kitchen area assemble everyone's orders.Good, basic vegetarian food. I really enjoyed it!",2
5,Love the friendly environment and wonderful food. I just can't say enough good things about this place. Yummy scones and salads but the tea is so Divine as well. Will return for sure.,2
3,"I know that a Target is a Target, but this one has proved to be reliable enough for me to want to drive 15 mins to it to get all my necessities in one place even though I could go to a cheaper grocery store.Everything's pretty organized the times I've come and the service is really good, there's a Starbucks inside. I've never had to wait in line super long, huge parking lot, clean store inside. Sometimes the employees seem grumpy but hey maybe it's just the day.",1
5,This is the best place in town for great Chinese food. Everything is top notch and one of may favorite things is that they double as a Japanese restaurant with fresh sushi. So I can start out with an appetizer of sashimi and have Chinese for the main course.,2
1,This salon is filthy.  There are cobwebs and dust every where.  The equipment is old and in disrepair.  My nail technician was actually watching you tube videos while doing my nails!  I do not know how the health department hasn't shut them down.,0
3,It's okay. There are definitely better sushi places in the area so better than going here. They always have the Groupon going on maybe some other specials but the quality is not where I prefer,1
5,"Very popular and with reason Hostess was super kind to us out-of-TownersAlso the hostess was checking IDs on young people before seating them at the bar, super smart. Food was fresh and tasted scratch/ homemade I may be blonde/gray haired and light eyed but I grew up in south Florida and this is good Mexican food. Very happy, thanks",2
4,"This review is mainly chicken talk as Cuenelli's Peruvian Style Rotisserie Chicken brings to the table. Pollo a la brasa.... Rotisserie chicken.... Whatever you wanna call it.... I call it a technique done here with love and pride. Lets be clear, you will find no comparison coming from your grocer deli section or at the checkout isle.Why do I think this chicken have some TLC put into it? On biting down of this chicken you can note seasoning flavors down to the bone. This is an inclination that prior to even getting into the rotisserie oven, these birds spend some time in some form of marinating process. Building flavor, the chicken also has a seasoning rub all over the skin.Lets go to this rotisserie oven. Another unique element is this oven has a charcoal or grill like component. This gives the chicken a smoky element in the flavor build. As these birds turn in this oven, they keep moist from the natural drippings dropping from bird to bird as they rotate through this oven. In turn, this a reason why some people may note some pieces the skin end up dry and crispy and others get moist or soggy skin on their chicken In the end, you end up with this tender, smoky, well seasoned, fall off the bone goodness. Wait.... how can they add more flavor? Cuenelli's serves it with two dipping sauces, a chimichurri  which gives a herbaceous and slightly spicy flavor, and an aioli which has a garlicky - lemony element.Round out this meal with some solid sides. Must haves for me would be the cilantro rice. Another herbaceous addition that works well with this meal. I got to use the word herbaceous a few times in this review, it has reflects such great imagery for food talk:) Must have beans with rice no? I pick the spicy pinto beans over the black beans at this establishment but lets be clear these beans are pretty spicy. I also love the maduros here. These sweet plantatains are cooked to perfection where the outsides has this caramelization from the natural sugar of the sweet plantain, leaving you with this toffee-like, stick to your tooth exterior and soft and sweet interior. Wash all down with Inca cola or a bottle of chicha limena.  Inca cola is almost like a cola champagne or a cream soda type of drink. Chicha Limena I say is Christmas in a bottle. This juice has a floral base blended with cinnamon and cloves.Though Cuenelli's Peruvian Style Rotisserie Chicken have many other notable Latin dishes, the one thing that comes to mind to me is this chicken made with love. This chicken gives new meaning to all who thought they knew what rotisserie chicken is. I say, go to Cuenelli's and taste again for the very first time.",2
4,"This place is amazing.It's a total hole in the wall type establishment, but boy do they cook some great food! Love their gyro salad, their falafel, they're platters, and the grocery area is an added bonus! I've gotten their stuffed spinach rolls there in addition to hummus, baba ghanoush and other odds and ends and have always been extremely satisfied.It's a very small place so it is always better if you call ahead for take out, if you can!",2
5,"This is great place to eat. The food was better than expected. Don't let the looks of the place fool you. Some of the best atmosphere I've ever experienced. Amber, our waitress was very attentive and efficient. A pleasurable experience for sure. If you get a chance you really need to check it out.",2
3,"I once had an allergic reaction to stealthy hidden carrots when I told the waiter that I didn't want carrots in my food.Other than that, it was yummy, but I think that the food really doesn't match the atmosphere and decoration of the place.",1
5,Great store. Insane selection. Incredible customer service.Wish they could come to Ft. McMurray. :(,2
1,"Went there the other night and the service was horrible. Girl behind counter yawned in my face than said ""what you want?"" Seriously? That's how you ask to take my order? Wow.. Trying not to judge the entire experience on terrible service, we tried our sundaes and were even less impressed. Our turtle sundae didn't have any caramel in it - you know -one of the main ingredients, my Christy had the worst iced brownie in it if ever tasted - total bargain basement, still frozen, so bad even a little Debbie brownie would have been a massive upgrade & the Smore was a pretty light on toppings, pretty sad excuse... Not going to waste my money here again, that's for sure! Will spend my money @ How Sweet Is This & Fritz's for now on, where I actually get what I pay for and more...",0
5,So happy my trainer turned me on to this place.   I walked in feeling terrible about myself and left feeling motivated and excited.  The products are amazing and Anna is extremely knowledgable.   Everyone there is friendly and motivating...,2
4,"I'm not much of a fan of modern mainstream country music but I like a lot of older stuff and love the blues. The band that was playing here today was perfect for me banging out a mix of electric blues, southern rock, bluegrass and everything in between. Assuming this is the type of band that normally plays here (and the vibe and decor here tells me it is) this would be a great spot in Nashville for those more into outlaw/alt country. Only bummer is that the beer and alcohol selection is a bit Spartan and generic; I asked for a local whiskey and was told all they had was Jack Daniels or one called Old Hickory (which is what I went with). Apparently they only have bottles for beer and it looks like only bud or corona.",2
1,Specifically came to the mall to get my brows done before a trip out of town and I walked in and stood there for two minutes until someone poked their head out of the back with two children and said they were on lunch break...was told to come back in 45 minutes. It was extremely unprofessional. No sign to indicate they were closed or anything! I will not be coming back.,0
5,Everything I've tried here has been awesome and the people who run it are great. The brisket is the best I've ever had and so are the Brussels sprouts.,2
5,"Customer service is amazing! Went for my first oil change here and besides not having to get out of my car, it was so quick and easy! Everyone was so friendly, polite, and informative. I will never go anywhere else for an oil change and will make sure that I tell everyone about how awesome this place is.",2
4,"Our family of four stayed two nights at the Palm Pavilion Inn a couple of weeks ago. This was our first stay at this hotel but after reading reviews, we had a good idea what to expect. First of all, this hotel is NOT a resort. It's an older, small, budget friendly, 3 story hotel that has been remodeled in a sort of funky, art-deco style and is an easy walk to the beach. Our room was small with two comfortable double beds but well appointed with flat screen tv, mini fridge and excellent wifi. The room is a little tight for four people but would be perfect for two. Coffee in the lobby. Friendly staff. Hotel furnishes beach towels and you can charge the beach chairs to the room. They even had some beach toys for our daughter to borrow.  I was told that for more money, the efficiency rooms are larger. We would definitely stay here again but would try out one of the larger rooms. If you're looking to stay at a chain type hotel or resort, this isn't for you. If you're looking for a small, family-owned, well appointed hotel, give Palm Pavilion.",2
2,"Really sad. Moon's opened a place on Fairview. Service slow. Food was sad. Potatoes weren't cooked, barely any hollandaise on the cali bene. Eggs were hard to compensate for the partially raw, barely warmed potatoes. Gave the server three chances to apologize or offer something for the returned half touched plate, but got nothing. Will never be going back. Not how I recall Moon's downtown every being.",0
4,"I brought my two littlest sisters here one rainy morning for pre-City Museum nourishment  and we were very impressed by the creative confections at Strange Donuts. From classics such as the Fat Steve's and glazed dones, to fun creations like the Fetty Wap and the Gooey Butter donut we had a great breakfast. I definitely recommend getting here earlier than later to make sure you get first crack at the fun donuts, and be sure to get enough to share because they'll disappear FAST!",2
5,The hazelnut sponge cake is the best around. Def worth the price and its always fresh.,2
4,"I've been coming to Heads & Tails since they opened; I followed Jenne from her old salon because she is, hands down the best waxer I've ever found. I also love that Heads & Tails uses the hard wax. My skin is super sensitive and I've burned a couple times with regular wax (I actually have a scar to prove it).I've also had my lashes tinted by Erin, and she did an amazing job!The only problem I have with the salon is the difficulty with getting an appointment - not because they're busy, I understand that part - but because no one ever answers the phone! H&T doesn't have a dedicated receptionist, so usually I have to call 3-4 times for an appointment. It's getting to the point where it's really frustrating. They do have an answering machine, but I can't take callbacks at work.",2
5,"I heard about this place by chance during a conversation involving Shakey's Pizza of which I was a huge fan. As it turns out, Boulevard Pizza was a Shakey's back in the day. I was told the franchisee bought the recipes for the pizza, the Rojo potatoes, and the wings when the business closed as Shakey's. So I tried it out and I have to say I don't have to drive to Oroville, CA for the closest Shakey's to Reno any longer. Everything was as I remember. When ordering I asked if the story was accurate and was told that it was. The place has a bar, separate from the dining area. And everyone is very friendly and personable like they care that you stopped by.",2
3,"You know what they say about sex or pizza; even when it's bad, it's good. 312 is not bad by any means! It just appears to be example of the growing trend of new restaurants in Nashville; price point does not match quality. This is based only on 2 experiences and is open to interpretation. What it does do well is provide great service. The staff were friendly, accommodating & seemed genuinely interested in ""serving"" you well. And this goes a long way in my book.",1
1,Service today was soooooo slow. 1.5 hours today to get simple lunch. Food was also awful which was really the worst. Oyster Po boy was disgusting and couldn't eat half of it. My colleague couldn't finish his chicken blt either because it was so bad. One of worst meals I've had in a long time. Zero stars are more appropriate. Do no go here.,0
5,"Good price and very tasty! I called ahead to order for pickup. The restaurant is just a few minutes down the road from me so that's another bonus. I saw all the good reviews and rating so I had to give it a try. I got there right before a rush and was waiting for my food and talking to Memo, who works there. He's very friendly. I was glad I got there when I did because four more customers came in! Memo was very nice and helped them with the menu and gave suggestions. I got home and chowed down on two steak tacos and a buffalo chicken taco. Totally delicious! Try this place, you'll love it.",2
5,"Loved the Bourbon flight! Bartender was attentive, and another bartender offered his opinion on the bourbon when he asked. Very friendly atmosphere.",2
5,Absolutely the best Chinese buffet in the state of Indiana! Always fresh and friendly. Great selection of food and desserts. Location is tucked away in a corner of a strip mall. Could use a face lift but don't change it by the appearance. Best stuffed mushrooms!,2
4,"This has easily become our favorite Mexican restaurant!  We love both the burrito & enchiladas with the cilantro cream sauce.  The chips & salsa are great, too.  We dropped in one night when they were offering a amaretto margarita as the special one night,  and it was delicious!",2
5,Loved District Donuts! Great outdoor seating & AMAZING donuts and sliders. I will be visiting again for sure!,2
4,"Went the other night for take out got an order of 12 wings and a buffalo chicken cheese steak both were very good no complaints at all.  Wings were tender and tasty and sandwich was spot on better then average quality chicken.  Also, picked up a soup to go last second for only $1.50 chicken escarole was a nice surprise and great price.  Need to check out the dinners and try it a few times to see if they can be consistent with food, but for now was very pleased.  Owner may want to pull back on all the Dallas Cowboys schwag all over the place may not sit well with customers that are Eagles fans and I have no doubt this would turn them off, but maybe he is going for a laugh who knows just would not chance it.  Good spot.",2
4,"Great pizza pie.  Stellar crust and ingredients, not overcooked.The place is stylish but fun.  The HVAC is poorly designed (causing drafts where seats next to each other vary wildly in comfort).Worse, the service is a mess.  When we finally got a waitress, she was great; but there was much confusion getting one in the first place.  I think they can earn that last star and a place among my favourites as they work out these kinks.  The &#960; is worth it.",2
5,Really good chicken tenders. Overpriced.  Drive-thru was fast and friendly. Would go back again.,2
4,"Tucked into a corner of a busy shopping center, the place was nearly empty when we walked in, but several other couples came in as we ate. The lunch menu, a mere two pages, seemed a bit limited. I ordered a meatball ricotta sandwich with salad, while my dad had a chicken Parmesan sandwich with homemade Parmesan fried potato chips. The salad was very fresh, with nice greens and homemade dressing. The potatoes, not quite as crisp as ordinary potato chips, were quite good. The meatballs were well above average, nicely seasoned and with generous but not overwhelming cheese. The chicken Parm looked rather flat, and my Dad did not finish it, proclaiming it ""not for me."" We finished up with Spumoni, very prettily presented with slivered almonds and a light drizzle of strawberry sauce. Service was friendly and attentive.",2
5,"This place was as quaint as can be, right in the middle of Doylestown inside the Doylestown Inn. The vibe is pretty cool with a speakeasy touch- mirrors and chandeliers hanging around for sale. Service was excellent, food came out super fast and was delicious!! We made reservations ahead and they had our table ready 10 mins before we got seated. Ordered our drinks and food and it took maybe 10 mins before the food was out. The arugula salad with chipotle shrimp and goat cheese was amazing!",2
2,"Our server was very nice.  And, the manager was kind enough to take the chips/dip off our bill because there was a piece of plastic about 2.5"" in the dip.  Other than that, I am sorry to say that the food left a lot to be desired.  The sauce on the wings was not very good.  The batter on the fried pickles tasted like thick cornmeal.  The cheese dip that came with the chips tasted like the pre-packaged stuff you'd get at a carnival.  The mini cheeseburgers were hard and tasteless.  The regular cheeseburger did not have much taste either.  However, the fries and the Coke were good.  We thought this would be a fun place to go but were disappointed to find otherwise.  We are fulltime RVers who have lived or worked in 48 of the 50 states (we'll get to Maine and Conn. next summer to make it 50) so we've experienced the worst and very best of places to eat.",0
4,"Loved it.  Great wine selection and patio/courtyard area.  The food menu was interesting and a lot of the combinations looked like fun, but we went with a cheese plate for snacking instead of doing a full meal.",2
4,New to the area. Was very pleased w/ my order; will definitely be ordering from them again. Had enough food to last me three days for under $9!!,2
3,"To my surprise, this place is excellent. Disappointed to see lot of negative reviews because folks are judging based on comparison to where they are from. You have understand that this place is in a working class section of O'Fallon, Illinois; you're not going to get the authentic experience. This is plain and simple a good TEX/MEX buffet...period. They have your standard fare of the Mexican stable classics, burritos, enchiladas, etc. I find that the taste here is very flavorful, and sharp. The buffet lay out is a bit annoying as they serve the food to you from behind the buffet stand. Not too thrilled with someone touching my taco shell with their hands (I'm a germ freak) as they scoop the meat on there, but oh well. The flavor is heavy on cumin, but I think it tastes good. The buffet is really cheap. The atmosphere is cozy. Not sure if they need a salad bar in there, it doesn't fit well. They should just have additional Mexican dishes instead. But do stop on by, cause you will be surprised.",1
5,"There were five of us,we were planing a Bridal shower. Our waitress was Taiya she was amazing,I think she had just as much fun with us as we did with her.  My daughter and I both had a full rack of Ribs so  juicy and covered with barbecue sauce,coleslaw and fries. Had the Fallen Cherry Stout loved it,the brewmaster Doug is the best. Can't forget the bartender Kelsey love her very friendly.",2
1,"I had a horrible experience here. The waiter was great but as I got my appetizer, there was it has a hair in it.Next the noodles came out mine was fine but my friend has a huge hair in his. I thought he was joking until he told me. After that it ruined my appetite, I gave the noodles back and they didn't even give me a new one, I thought I should've got the food for free at that point.. never eating here again",0
5,"This hidden gem was exactly what I needed after 3 straight days without a good breakfast or legitimate breakfast food. The bananas foster French toast looked amazing from afar, but I had the Montana plate (two eggs, biscuit and sausage gravy, two sausage patties, two slices of ham, three bacon strips, and home fries). My gf had the most popular - for a reason - shrimp and grits. Both dishes were amazing. Her grits were creamy and the shrimp cooked and seasoned perfectly. The sausage gravy was spicy enough, but I still added some Crystal sauce for that extra sump'n. The sausage was legit sausage, not some pre-made in a factory to be the same flat shape sausage. This sausage was molded by hand. Just amazing. But enough of reading. Just grab your cash, find what loose change you have in your couch cushions or under your car seats (cash only place) and get to Surrey asap!!!",2
4,"I really enjoyed the sweet potato fries with sriracha aioli - definitely the highlight of my visit.  Hip City Veg offers this sophisticated dish, which you might expect to see only at much fancier restaurants, in a casual, fast-food setting.  Based on prior Yelp reviews, I tried the udon noodle salad, which was pretty good, but was a little unbalanced and could be improved.  Although it had a promising start with a pleasant mix of ""chick'n"", arugula, and alfalfa sprouts, the bottom half of the salad had too much seasoning.  An easy fix might be to ease up on the dressing, or leave it as a side component.  The dining atmosphere is pleasant - sort of like an eco-friendly, fast food joint that seeks to bring vegan dishes to the masses. I like the concept, but if you're a diehard carnivore, I'm not sure this place will convince you otherwise.  That said, the location is great if you are on the Penn campus looking for a lunch option or staying at the Homewood Suites on 41st and Walnut, and want to try something new. This location does a brisk take-out business, but it's also a casual place to dine alone or with a friend.  However, the space is not ideal for large groups except for the giant table in the middle of the room.  I look forward to seeing Hip City Veg in the Washington DC area.  It should do well there.",2
3,"It's a salad place like saladworks. Lettuce had thick stems, chickpea hot topping wasn't too flavorful.",1
5,"Got two paintings framed here and they turned out great. Very knowledgable with plenty of options to customize your frame needs. It is a little bit on the pricey side compared to aaron bros or the other large stores, but you can definately see the difference in the quality and look. Will be back in the future!",2
4,"Hole in the wall, but awesome! Fresh food (homemade guac, shells, etc.). Tasty shrimp tacos.",2
5,What's to say about Ted Drewes? It's delicious. I like the Cindermint concrete and the Johnny Rabbit concrete. On Friday  night I had the Johnny Rabbit (cherries and chocolate chips). Yum! I took my grandmother and she had the Terramizzou. She was thrilled and hadn't been there in years. Go there. It's delicious!,2
1,"Bad, bad bad!  Why?1.  Ice cream is not quality (especially the banana & chocolate, unless you like those cheap circus peanut candies cause it tastes like that.  The chocolate is nothing special, a little bland) They use the cheapest of ice creams and the taste proves it!  ( my mother had a business and we know this brand- cheap for businesses to purchase)2.  The counter person.  It was hours before closing when I went and all she kept saying out loud was how she was ""never going to get out of here"".  She complained the entire time to her coworker friends who were just as loud and non professional.3.  Portions are good, but take out ice cream in cheap cups and the spoons can even handle a scoop before it breaks!4.  $$$$$  If you are going to spend your money, go to Haggen Daaz! I would't have even given this place one star, but you have to.",0
3,"Great menu & cozy place but probably better for dinner than brunch.   it's very small so don't bring more than 4 people, they only have one large table.   The menu is small but everything sounds great.  We would have tried more things but they were out of about 50% of the items:  doughnuts, pancakes, french toast & waffles. Which is probably a testament to how good the place is but not so great as a patron.   The Sequel & Eggs Benedict were marvelous.  Atmosphere is cool, but our server might have been having an off day.  They also seem weird about bringing you salt and don't have hot sauce but that's forgiveable.  Not forgiveable:  the Bloody Wilbur.  visually gross looking (and can't stress that enough!) and not much on flavor.  don't tease about Bacon Flavored vodka and not deliver.  Also odd:  the biscuits & gravy tasted like supreme pizza.  not awful but weird i guess, good if you really like supreme pizza for breakfast.   to each is own!",1
3,"The idea is cool,  but the tacos were a bit of a disappointment. We got the chicken, carne asada and fish tacos. The chicken was dry and carne asada was salty so it wasn't full of flavor. The fish taco was good, though! Tender, juicy, and crispy! I don't think the tacos are worth the price, especially since tacos are supposed to be a cheap, simple and delicious food. Overall, I wouldn't go back but it is a cool atmosphere and right in downtown which is convenient.",1
5,Delicious.  Everything our group of four ordered was delicious.  It's a popular local place so plan on making your reservation on Open Table and plan accordingly.,2
3,I really liked the place however they need a bus boy at the pool people left their dirty plates and no one came to pick them up there were dirty dishes everywhere when we got to the pool it was gross!,1
5,"Rick Lewis is pretty much Mark McGwire. The guy just keeps hitting home runs when he opens restaurants. First Southern and now Grace Meat + Three. By the way, I do realize McGwire took steroids but who didn't back then? It was the thing to do in the 90s! As was the Macarena. What a time to be alive!I met my brother here for a ""cheat day"" meal. I couldn't think of a better place to ruin all my hard work in the gym and in the kitchen than at this new southern cuisine hot spot in the Grove.In order to get a taste of a few things we split a half hot chicken and half rack of BBQ pork ribs.  Our four sides: cornbread, Mac and cheese, fried potatoes, and greens.Review:Hot chicken: unlike Lewis' other hot chicken place, Southern, this place only has one heat level. It's certainly spicy but not too spicy. As expected, the chicken was big, juicy, and crispy. It got my nose running and eyes watering. Loved it! It's pretty much what you'd get at Southern from what I could tell. That's good!  BBQ Ribs: Not overly meaty but plenty filling and topped with an excellent, sweet glaze. More than likely I'll be going for the hot chicken over the ribs from now on but that's 100% because the hot chicken is the Mayor of Flavor Town.Fried potatoes: ours were fresh out of the oven. Very crispy, thick, and good seasoning.Mac and cheese: not bad. Could have been more cheesy(everything in the world could be more cheesy, though, in my opinion). The crumble on top added a nice flavor.Cornbread: Tasty. Not too sweet. More bread than corn...whatever that means...wink wink.Greens: I'm not a greens guy but my brother liked it.Conclusion paragraph:I had high expectations going in. Especially since I've limited my carbs and calories for the last two weeks. A bad cheat meal would have = a sad Scott. However, I was very pleased with everything and highly recommend this to anyone looking to get some belt busting southern food!",2
3,"Sorry Yelpers, but I thought this Jose Garces restaurant was just okay.Village Whiskey is pretty tiny.  About seven round tables that could fit maybe three people (might be able to fit four, but highly unlikely) and some room at the bar.  Came for lunch at 11:30am when they opened, and by about 12:15pm, all the tables and most of the seats at the bar were taken.  We were the second group to be seated, and although there was no one else in the restaurant at the time, our waitress seemed to be preoccupied after taking our order.  She knew we were still deciding on drinks, so why didn't she check on us again?  Hello!  She wasn't very attentive and seemed like she would rather be elsewhere.I ordered the Village Burger (an 8 ounce burger on a sesame roll with Boston bibb lettuce, tomato, and house-made thousand island dressing: $11) and added Jasper Hill cheddar cheese ($3.50) and fried egg ($1.50).  Perfect brunch meal right?  Eh.  Was just okay.  The burger wasn't anything spectacular, definitely not anything to rave about.  It was juicy, but lacked flavor.  Usually the bun makes the burger (for me at least), and I thought the sesame roll was okay.  Tasted like an everyday burger bun to me.  The cheddar cheese and fried egg were a nice additional to the burger.  At 8 ounces, this burger is pretty huge!  Could definitely serve as another meal or late night snack.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EtKSTHV5Qx_Q7Aur9o4kQQ?select=QZ4Yn47TLprQlbCRWMtZdwWe also ordered the duck fat french fries with sly-fox cheddar sauce ($7) to share.  I've always always wanted to try duck fat fries.  These left me wanting more.  Really...is this what they really taste like?  I hope not.  These fries were more soggy than crispy, and left a weird after taste in my mouth.  The cheddar sauce was a welcomed additional, but not necessary.  The sauce would have been better if it was hotter.  When our waitress finally came back with our food, we were able to order the Irish Car Bomb shake ($9).  Ours definitely didn't look like a lot of the pictures that were posted on Yelp.  For $9, this shake better be spectacular!  Again, it was just okay.  I did enjoy those chunks of brownie pieces though! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EtKSTHV5Qx_Q7Aur9o4kQQ?select=EbqJLiD6Pkw7u1KgFVmJAARG ordered the Whiskey King (an 8 ounce burger on a sesame roll with maple bourbon glazed ciopollini, rogue bleu cheese, applewood bacon, and foie gras-$26).  Massive burger.  The bleu cheese was almost non-existent.  I tried a bite, and the foie gras was pretty good.  The applewood bacon was a nice touch.  But again, the burger was just okay.  FYI-Don't look up at the ceiling fans, they were so filled with dirt, that you might get dust in your eyes!",1
5,This is my favorite restaurant in philly. Can't say I've had one bad dish out of several times I have been here. It has the perfect mom-and-pop shop vibe with excellent service. Make sure you get the ginger and black bean glazed tilapia.,2
4,"This place is versatile as anything in the Lou!  I've been here a handful of times and have always enjoyed it.  I've gone for all different types of visits.  I've gone for a late night drink and music, coffee and a study session, an evening meal, and an afternoon lunch and exploration.  This place has it all.  I have enjoyed going to do work or school work because they have bottomless coffee and free wifi.  The fact that they serve their full menu all day is nice because I can order whatever I want whenever I want.  I usually spend several hours working there and that is always nice to have.  Waitresses never seem to mind when i stay for long periods of time and spend small amounts of money.  In addition there is a lot of space to sit.  Finally, I can always go upstairs to play ping pong or shuffleboard if I need a little study break.While there menu is not huge, it has quite a bit of variety.  They offer very unique dishes, including some cool breakfast plates that are offered all day.  I must mention that everything on the menu is made in house, including their bread, meats, and sauces, which I find to be impressive.  Overall, the menu includes salads, soups, interesting appetizers, unique breakfast dishes, a variety of entree's, desserts, beers (9 oz/16 oz) and cocktails.  For the most part, everything is modestly priced.  This place continues to intrigue me because of all the different things it offers.  It has multiple levels and it triples as a restaurant, bar, music venue.  I can say I have not been there for a true concert yet, but they seem to have quite a few shows and are not usually too expensive to attend.  The 1st floor is split between the music venue and the restaurant/bar.  The 2nd floor has more open space that holds the shuffle board, ping pong table and more tables/chairs.  It also has some balcony seating for the venue side as well as another bar on this floor.  Again, I'd love to catch a show here sometime.  Overall, I think that this place is worth a visit so that you can try out the menu and explore a little bit.  It's not usually too crowded during the day and you could have free run of the place depending on when you go!",2
5,"We got a sweet deal on Expedia for one night and we jumped at it.  We arrived late as the snow was falling and promptly assisted by the Valet to get us and our luggage out of the car.The front desk staff was quick to get us to our rooms and called later to make sure that we got everything we needed.In the room (tower room i believe) was a whirl pool that we enjoyed.  We didn't get to enjoy the rest of the amenities, as we were only driving through Reno, but I found it to be a great though brief experience.",2
5,Outstanding all around. Fresh salsa and great service for our party of 9. A must if you want Mexican while in NOLA,2
4,"Three Muses is a tapas bar unlike any other I've frequented. Gone is the pretentiousness that are normally associated with tapas restaurants I've visited. Instead there was a really nice, easy going, order from any of us cause it gets loud in here type vibe.I wish i could remember what we ordered, but there were four of us and we ordered a bit of everything. The sweet potato gnocchi was so good we had to order another round. I also had a blueberry mojito that was divine.  The food came out fast and all of it was just incredible. We totally would have spent some serious cash if not for another engagement we had to get to. Oh, get there early, cause this place will get crowded quickly. it's that good.",2
5,"We were here drunk as all heck. after closing time. our guys at larry's hooked us up with leftover cheesesteaks and a meatball. not only was this the best drunk experience of our young lives, but we owe our lives to the workers at larry's. god bless, you have our business for life. thank you and god bless.",2
5,I like that they brew their own beers but also distillery on the premise. You can get Gin or other hard liquor besides beer. It's in the old train depot by the Reno Aces ballpark.A nice place to go before an Aces game. The food is on the pricey side but still ok!,2
3,"A great location and beautiful building in the French Quarter.  We enjoyed the red wine - Galatoire's own, and it was reasonably priced.   Everything we ordered was very nice and we had a variety of menu items.  My friends had an oyster appetizer and loved it.  One of our steaks was overlooked but they corrected it quickly. The service was exceptional. Only 2 negatives - they have a dress code and the place was small and extremely noisy!  Overly loud, in fact. (Thus the three stars). We had been hoping for nice, quiet and leisurely dinner.  They pack all the guests towards the back as they are seated, so it looks top heavy on one end of the restaurant.",1
3,"This review is for Sunday brunch only. The inside of the inn is beautiful and historic, particularly the Library which is where our large group was seated. The service was great. The brunch offerings, however, were not so impressive. At $26pp, a waffle station would have been nice. Or pancakes. If you wanted eggs, you had to wait at the omelet station. A type of breakfast meat other than pork bacon would have been good also, e.g. turkey sausage, turkey bacon. The vodka penne, chicken francaise, potatoes and green beans were all lacking in flavor.  The cookies and other dessert items were not worth the calories or fat content.",1
4,Really great beer!  Liked the free video games and Skeeball as well!  Tacos were delicious but they could expand the menu a bit.,2
1,"My sister, my great niece were at the Village and thought we'd give Cinnaholic's a try. I sure am glad we bought the mini cinnamon rolls but wish we hadn't bought any. The bread in the cinnamon rolls was dry (either cooked too long or stale), there was hardly any cinnamon filling and the toppings were horrible. Mine was supposed to be a standard cream cheese topping but it didn't taste like there was any cream cheese in it.  Maybe they gave me the wrong topping because it tastes like coconut. My sister got maple flavored which she did not like.  The 6 year old ate her cotton candy frosting but we did not like it.  To say the least, we scraped off all the toppings and still didn't eat all of the rolls. Perhaps this was a fluke but I seriously doubt we will come back to find out. Sorry.  I don't like writing bad reviews.",0
4,"Grabber a quick dinner to Kampai : I was pleased with their good quality sushis, I like that you get a soup and a salad included with your order. I wish it was a little bit less pricier and more choices for the hand roll (e.g regular salmon/avocado) Good service as well, I recommend.",2
5,"Super--fabulous! I chose to patronize this store during my trip to New Orleans simply based on the yelp feedback. I was not disappointed! Fabulous! This liquor store was more charming and delivered better service to me than the Omni Hotel. The owner and his seasoned staff (24 plus years of loyal employees) were so gracious, plus THEY DELIVERED to my hotel.  Ignore the ""outdated and dirty"" comments from others, this place is quaint. THE BEST, I mean the best bloody Mary you can get for cheap folks!  Delicious, with plenty of garnish. I say they were better and more affordable than the bloody Marys at Pat O'Briens!!  I cannot wait for my next trip to Nawlins and I will be back to this joint--no doubt!",2
4,We were staying at the HIE Rocky Point. We didn't want to go out so we ordered Chinese.Pleasantly surprised. Food was excellent and the price was right.,2
3,"People have been recommending we try this place for years.  We finally stopped in this weekend for the Sunday Brunch.  The location and setting are beautiful.  The Sunday brunch costs about $33 per person, and it includes a buffet, made to order menu, and unlimited mimosas.  The price is great for the amount of food; however, the quality of the food was just above average.  The servers continually brought out the wrong orders to our table, and we waited 20 minutes after being seated before our server came over to the table.  If I am going to be in the area for brunch, I would prefer to pay $55 per person for Oystercatchers, where the quality of food and service is much higher, and the setting is equally beautiful.",1
5,"Oh hell yes. So good!I usually would not drive so far out of my way for a restaurant, but we came here with some family and I am so glad we did! I'd never been to Dunedin prior to this, and what a cute little place it is! Adorable little downtown area that you'd never expect from such a small town. Anywho, Kelly's. When we went, it was jam packed. I believe the wait was 30-45 minutes, so it would certainly behoove you to call ahead and make a reservation. The service was good for how busy it was. Not super quick, but friendly and punctual enough. You can only expect so much when they're packed to the gills. The food was phenomenal, and priced pretty fairly for the quality. Perhaps a teensy tiny bit overpriced compared to similar restaurants, but overall can't complain there. I had the seafood pasta and hoooooly cow. Cannot wait to go back for more. It was absolutely decadent, and I'm not even a fan of pasta. If you're already a pasta lover this will knock your socks off. The pasta was so tender and the dish had such a great, deep seafood flavor- not weak or briny at all. My mouth is watering a bit just thinking about it. My husband had the baby back ribs and they were devoured in a matter of minutes, so I would guess that means they were good. I can't remember off the top of my head what the other diners had, but I do remember everyone was very, very happy with their meals. Highly recommended!",2
4,"Costco - wholesale shopping off 86th and Michigan  Road is one of my favorite places to shop. While I don't buy many food items in bulk, their food is fresh and great quality. This place has a great selection of merchandise and what's even better is Costco stands by every item they sell. If you're not 100% happy - just return it for a full refund. No questions asked. Amazing customer service!Costco has yet to disappoint me but plan on waiting in line if you shop there during prime shopping hours especially on weekends! Best to get there when they first open to beat the crowds.COSTCO ROCKS!! :)",2
2,Beautiful place. Excellent food. I only gave it a 2 because they gouge you on the drinks. My manhattan was $16. A very small glass of house wine was $11.50. There is no justification for that. We eat out often in good restaurants. This is the only place that gouges you on the drinks.I got the halibut. It was delicious but quite small with nothing on the side.,0
1,"My boyfriend and I arrived at Don Pablo's at 5:45 on Saturday night. We were told the wait was 30 minutes- awesome. After 45 minutes passed, we checked in with the hostess again. "" Oh, you had a faulty buzzer"". No apology, no coming to find us, nothing. The manager took us to our table, again no apology- just explained that this happens a lot.After being seated, our server came 15 minutes later for our drink order. No introduction, just ""What do you want to drink."" After ordering a margarita and beer, we waited another 10 minutes for our drinks to arrive.I regret our appetizer of flauetas or whatever they are called. Frozen taquitos that were rock hard when they arrived at my table. After the appetizer, it took 35 minutes for our entrees to reach the table. My boyfriends was cold and mine was incorrect. After already being in this restaurant for over 2 hours, we had enough. The waiter saw we were frustrated and took one meal off the bill. Terrible service, terrible food, terrible management. First and last visit for us!",0
2,"Pros: it tasted like PizzaCons: the dough was frozen and the crust was thicker than most places.  It was a disappointing to say the least.  Bottom line: It was lower tier pizza, Actually Costco pizza was a little better and cheaper.",0
4,"Cute place right by the beach. I ordered the grouper sandwich. The sandwich was rather skimpy on the fish, but the waffle fries were great.",2
5,Lainy is the best! So happy with her tattoos and happy to find an artist I can trust.,2
5,"Dave's Dogs is a hot dog stand in a parking lot.  Nothing fancy just delicious hot dogs and a place to sit and enjoy them.   But they are not your usual hot dogs.  They are gourmet hot dogs five to choose from:  Dave's Style, Western Style, SB Style, BBQ Bacon and Pizza Dog.  I tried the Pizza Dog it was sooooo good.  A wiener topped with pepperoni, pizza sauce, cheese and Parmesan ($5.00).The secret ingredients to ""Dave's Dogs"" hot dogs is the quick and friendly service,  cool and calm personality  and it seems great pleasure is taken to making each hot dog a masterpiece. Overall a great atmosphere for hungry Yelpers, good times and delicious hot dogs.",2
2,"This place is gorgeous and quite an experience. My complaints lie more with their administrative faults and the 500 taxes they add to your bill:When I made my initial reservation, they took $300 from my account, but I understood what that was for. However, when I checked in, they charged me for both nights because the $300 I had already deposited had not ""appeared on the system."" They finally found the glitch and said they'd give the money back at checkout (which they have yet to do), and $300 is some good spending money, especially at this resort. When it came to checkout, they apply a $18/night resort fee, so...WHY is this NOT applied to the room rate in the first place?!? So if you're looking at prices, add that, plus parking ($20 self park, $28 valet A NIGHT!). Then add the additional SIX taxes per night, that average around $15 per tax. You do the math, and add that to the room rate that is advertised before deciding on an extended stay. Honestly would've been better off in a downtown hotel overlooking the city.",0
5,The manager Shawn Bracken and our waiter clearly care about their customers and the entire experience at PF Chang's. They went above and beyond on a busy night to make sure we were taken care of. Will definitely be coming back to this location. (Also recommended the Korean chicken which is not on the menu but is phenomenal),2
5,"Came home from a trip overseas and girlfriend announces she found a banh mi shop in Wilmington. Skeptical at first I agreed to check it out. I was quite surprised by their menu being written in Vietnamese which gives me an authentic vibe. I glanced at the staff and asked them something in Vietnamese and she replied which was rather assuring. I've had past experiences where you enter an establishment which claims they are Vietnamese and turned out to be Chinese and that's another story. Onto the food, we ordered an original and a grill chicken banh mi. Very authentic and large in size which made it a very good deal. Very tasty and stuffed with meats and veggies. Overall it is my new place for banh mi and saves me the trip up to Washington Ave in Philadelphia for genuine Vietnamese banh mi.",2
5,"A spectacular establishment that instantly takes you back to childhood memories.  In a quest to find a favorite, yet elusive candy bar, our search brought us to Cravin's.  Leaving grandpa in the car, my daughter and I went in expecting to only spend a few minutes.  Needless to say, we spent way more time and money than originally planned...but in a good way.  Cravin's carried our holy grail of candy, the Cup O Gold, and a bonus was finding Mint Rocky Road! Since I was visiting from Korea on R&R, I bought an entire box of C.O.G. as well as Idaho Spuds, a handful of Mint RR's, a Star Wars candy dispenser for my hubby's office and a few other things.  I must have walked around the store at least 3 times and know I still didn't see everything that was there.  I was very appreciative of the military discount and I can't wait to return on my next trip home to visit family.",2
4,"I have been in a couple of times. I would skip their Pad Thai, I like it a particular way and either you got it or you don't.  What I do like is a lot of other items, like the Sweet Basil Salmon or the NomNom salad. I have also seen plenty of other dishes float by that I am willing to try.There expansion seems to have paid off  and its now much more comfortable to sit and stay a bit.",2
5,"Having heard about deprivation tanks from friends, I was eager to try one and was able to convince my mom and sister to go with me.  Float Nashville is a friendly and super clean.  We were immediately welcomed.  After we filled out their form we were given a tour of the facility and tips and tricks about floating.  We had time to ask as many questions as we needed, although we were all eager to float.Once in your chosen Float chamber room, everything you need is at your disposal (shower gel, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, ear plugs, contact lens case & solution, q-tips, ear plugs, petroleum jelly - used to cover cuts...).  They've thought of everything.You then take your shower and get into the tank.  Immediately you are floating and limitless.The experience was amazing, each of us got something from the experience and we all want to go back.  For me the biggest gift was the feeling of complete relaxation, that as a muscle memory and being able to get back to that state after the float easily and effortlessly.Would definitely recommend this to adults of any age!",2
4,"The first thing one notices upon entering this place is that it smells wonderful. Like all Ben & Jerry's, the ice cream is delicious and there tons of flavors & toppings from which to choose. The staff is generally fast & courteous, if a bit hipsterish. I've never had any complaints about my experiences here, but there's also never been anything so terrific as to merit five stars.",2
3,"everything seems right when you walk in.  pretty space, soft colors, and a sense of home design.  food was, chicken a little under cooked, the corn side under cooked, and the portions were off especially compared to one of my guest who ordered the same.  didn't feel well for a day or so - this happens, but i had thought the  theme of highly attentive food preparation would be #1 priority.  Kitchen is loud probably needs some fine tuning and a strong personality to crack the whip.",1
1,"I won't be going back.  The chips were shiny with oil, and not tasty.  The salsa was bland, and made out of canned tomatoes.  Entrees come with no sides at all.  They are ordered separately, and can't be ordered for one person.  Everything but baked beans was a 2-person portion.  That is just stupid.  As a result, we ended up getting salads, which were uninspiring.  Also, mine listed avocado as an ingredient, yet none was to be found.  The food wasn't bad, but neither was it good.  This area has far better restaurants.  Avoid!",0
5,"Hands down, best of the best all around... and the best part is, it is local too!!! WooHoo... Thank you and we love you Buddy Brew!!!",2
5,"I can't comment on the service, as my wife picks this up and brings it home. But I can comment on the food, it's great. It's always fresh and tasty. I love the fiery habanero and usually get it on everything. We get food from here a few times a month, and it has yet to disappoint!",2
2,"The food is pretty low quality, it's almost always dead and the only reason we go there is for BYO'ing. Definitely a place to steer clear of if you are looking for real Indian food.",0
2,"Summary: good service, lacking amenities, had a good time, one stay is enough.First off, please don't see any of my complaints as reflecting poorly on the staff, all of which did a great job and deserve whatever employment they have. Most of the issues I had were beyond the staff's control and probably due to my own lack of research before I booked my room. That said...There wasn't any bathtub, pool, sauna, spa etc, I realize this place is less expensive than the Ritz or other nearby hotels and I didn't realize until midway through the stay how much this would affect my stay. Room service closes at 10 or 11pm, which was a disappointment, and a small room service menu. Considering the prices for breakfast items, it wasn't very impressive and nothing seemed made to order. WiFi is very unreliable, I had a corner room and never had a consistent connection for more than a few minutes at a time. The guest computers in the lobby didn't have any kind of ""user profile"" system so be aware and erase temporary internet files if you use them - when I got on the computer the previous guest's Gmail info was all right there for me to get into if I wanted. The decor looks flashy but once you poke around you realize it's all pretty cheap stuff, the dresser drawers in my room didn't close all the way, towels were scratchy and thin, carpet was old and funky etc. Also the valet charges in the neighborhood of $35 for parking, there is a 24hr parking lot with tons of space literally 100 feet away that charges about $23. Breakfast buffet is around $20 for the same cheapo continental that you would get at say a Best Western. At one point the fire alarm went off because a drunk guest went out the fire door to throw up, everyone evacuating saw this happen as they went down the stairs, but we still had to leave even though it was confirmed there was no actual fire.I would rather spend more money next time and stay somewhere with better amenities. If you want to stay somewhere cheap, stay somewhere that's actually cheap - this place was around $135 a night even with the Friends and Family discount. There are places for $70 per night that offer similar amenities.",0
5,"Carne Seca burro was smokey, delicious and really filling. The price is great for what they give you. If only they automatically put some tomatoes and lettuce. :( Other than that, you have to stop by and try the carne seca burro, especially if you're just visiting the area. The tortilla is amazing - if I wasn't in the process of moving, I would have taken a few back home to eat. Don't forget to order an horchada - they serve one that is delicious!",2
5,I did a cemetery tour this afternoon with Brian and he was AWESOME!!! The cemetery was super crowded and he did a really great job of keeping us away from the other groups and making sure we had enough time to take photos and ask questions. I don't usually take guided tours so I was pleasantly surprised but how relaxed the whole experience was. Brian was knowledgeable and super entertaining. Highly recommended!,2
4,"This is one of those places that continue to surprise me here in New Orleans -- that a convenience store food mart serves Vietnamese food. And it seems pretty legit. I discovered the place when I did a banh mi search on Yelp. I was surprised, but probably would not have made the effort to go if it wasn't located right next door to the Aristocat Nail Salon, where I had a Living Social coupon for a mani pedi. The owner of the salon is Vietnamese and I trust that she knows her food and she highly recommended the place. So far, I've only had a banh mi there, which is a bit different than other ones I've had. I usually go with the standard cold cut combo, but Eat Well's is overstuffed with barbecue pork. It 's really delicious, but it can also be a tad bit greasy, but you know, sometimes grease is good! The people who work there are really nice and you can call in and they'll have it ready for pick up! And they don't seem to mind when I ask for extra pickled carrots and daikon. Oh, and extra spicy, too! Now, I go out of my way to pick up a banh mi before work! MMMM -- I'm hungry now just thinking of it!",2
5,"This place is top notch,experienced shooters will not be disappointed.Very rare to have a indoor 100 yard rifle range !!!!  Massive selections of all types guns & gear.",2
3,"I've only been here to pick up an outpatient, my father.  I was greeted warmly, right away, and though he has a difficult last name, the receptionist had no problem finding him.  She even told me that he was a great patient- funny and cheerful.  She told me to have a seat and that he'd be out soon.  He was out in approximately 5 minutes happy and mostly pain-free from the injection he received.  I wouldn't be able to give this facility a full review, but they treated me well while I waited.",1
5,"I can't say enough great things about the baked goodies that come out of this kitchen.  I have YET to have anything that is 'subpar'.  Everything comes out with full flavor and with the right texture! Then the delicate and decorative detailing--just phenomenal.  You can tell that TIME and LOVE goes into each piece of goodness!!  I love all of the signature flavors.  I am a 'classic' cupcake person- and absolutely love her signature cream cheese frosting.  Talk about melt in your mouth! If you are looking for any sort of cake, cupcake, pie, cookie, or ALL THE ABOVE...do yourself a favor and treat yourself and loved ones to Sugar Coated! (no pun intended!) =)",2
5,"This is my 3rd time visiting and I will definitely be back. Wanted to try the Philadelphia Salad since it incorporates my love of french fries and need for a salad at some point in the day. :)  You can add chicken, shrimp, or steak but I passed on these options this time. Fries were delicious. Not greasy and were plump and fresh. Maybe could have used some sort of seasoning salt and been a tad crispier but that is a personal preference and not something to detract from the dish.  Salad was freshly made which is a big plus as pre-made and chilled salads have no flavor.  Enjoyed the salad and am excited about going back and trying a new item.",2
5,"five stars because it is a casino. They have lots of slots.. everything from a nickel and UP! I play the unicorn slot machine because it reminds me of the unicorns, my favorite band. I usually walk away with the same amount of $ I spent-- I make enough to buy a round of drinks.Brittney Mullen is the best cocktail waitress. She is the fastest and nicest cocktail waitress ever. Request her many times.",2
1,"Nice hotel, room was very nice and clean, staff nice. Reason for the one star is the elevator. DO NOT get a room by the elevator, you can hear it and it is very loud with lots of banging. Unless you like a loud thud every 20-30 seconds, do not stay here. They put us in a room by the elevator and it's impossible to sleep.",0
4,"I was shopping at WinCo long before I moved to Reno 3 years ago. As far as I'm concerned it's the only supermarket chain in town.  Like one other reviewer said I do stop at Trader Joe's  when I go do a major shopping trip because of their somewhat different produce selections and their wonderful whole wheat bread offerings.  I use a lot of nuts to try to stay healthy and I love the bulk department for those because I can buy them in large or small quantities at a low price. I also use many other products from this department: whole wheat pasta, dry beans and veggies, chips and the wonderful no sugar chocolates.It was interesting when the store recently opened a fresh sushi bar. I, like many others, was very happy to see it. I dinged them one star because of the fact that if you are there at a busy evening you might find little kids running up and down the isles and playing Nerf football in the open areas.  Parents from this part of town who are doing their shopping should keep their children with them and under control.I actually prefer shopping at WinCo South as that problem does not seem to exist there.",2
5,Great staff. Great drinks. The 5 is because they make my current favorite local beer. The undisputed shadow boxer!!! Very nice place inside and I highly recommend a stop here at some point in your night out.,2
5,"In a nutshell:  These guys are awesome to deal with.  They came on time;  They worked their butts off until the job was done;  They were very tidy and considerate of my property; and I got exactly what was promised at a fair price.The Details:  When my A/C went on a hot summer day I thought ugh, I wish I knew someone in the field.  I didn't, so I started reading reviews and calling around.  The main HVAC repair companies around town came across as contractors (middlemen) that would just end up costing me more money in the end.  I knew what I wanted.  I wanted to deal directly with the guy who was going to do the work.  Someone who cared about customer satisfaction.  Someone I could trust.  I found all those things and more when I spoke to Ray, the owner and operator of Trust Home Comfort.When I read some of the reviews on the competition, it seemed that the biggest frustration out there were people who were charged a couple hundred of dollars to get a guy out, only to be told that their old A/C was not worth repairing.  I didn't want that to happen to me, so I took the unorthodox approach of taking a brief video of my problem and posting it to YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iMHhimCqUo .  This will be great, I thought.  Saves everyone time, and hopefully me some money.  Right?Wishful thinking, none of the big companies were even willing to look at the video.  So I kept calling around.  Eventually, I got a hold of Van (the office guy) at Trust Home Comfort.  He was great!  He said ""Sure, we'll have a look at the video"", so I emailed him the link with some photos of my system.  I heard back a short time later from the owner of the company, Ray, who is a journeyman HVAC technician with a 4 year degree in Refrigeration Technology.  Ray told me straight up that he didn't think the problem was what I was hoping it would be (a low cost contactor part), but in order to know for sure he would have to come out and run a diagnostic.  They both reassured me that if I had to replace the entire system, I wouldn't be charged for the service call AND a new system.When Ray (the owner/technician) arrived the next day he took his electronic meter measurements, and was able to confirm that my compressor was shot.  I would need a new system. We sat down to discussed my options.  Ray was very honest and forthright about which system would be best for me.  He took his time and shared his experience about what other customers have liked. No high pressure sales.  No lies about pricing.  Just the straight honest goods you would expect from a technician.  I loved that.  We ended up upgrading our HVAC system to one of the new units that is VERY quite and comes with a 10 year parts warranty.  I think my neighbor was especially pleased with the ""quite"" part.Ray was even willing to do the job on a long weekend, even though he planned on taking it off.At the end of the day, we got a new ""Green"" A/C unit, a new updated humidifier, and a new WiFi thermostat which I can control from anywhere in the world through my iPhone.  All for a very reasonable price.  Very cool.  Literally!(My daughter's comment about this review:  ""Why don't you write a book"".)",2
4,"An interactive mass produced chain restaurant! Hooray!! Order lots of meat. I mean, LOTS. Like a meat entree with 2 meat sides. You'll thank me.",2
5,"Talk about a guilty pleasure! Just the number of awesome flavors they have, makes this a place I want to go to every day. It's probably a good thing that I'm an hour away, because I would quickly gain some extra pounds. In addition to ice cream, you can also order hot beverages which this time of year (winter) is also rather nice. Lets get back to the ice cream...Om nom nom nom....I want some now. It's hard to describe ice cream, so I suggest you stop by and get some!",2
4,Looking for a funky little place to hang out? This is it! Its got a huge wine selection and a cooler full of unique cheeses. You can ask them to do a custom cheese plate with cheese you select or ask for the cheese plate of the day. They also have fun bites of food like barbecue shrimp and bacon-wrapped dates to accompany the live music in their cozy little courtyard. This is more of a local gem than a tourist joint. It is one of my favorite places to spend an evening!,2
4,"Yum! We go on Sundays when kids eat free. Family of 5 eats dinner for under $25. Bar-b-q is yummy, nice portions, and free ice cream. I like pulled pork and the beef brisket, if you go late they may be sold out of some meats. My only complaint is the dining room is small and during dinner time there is a long wait for food and sometimes a seat. Despite this it's a family favorite.",2
4,"I have been to Ru San's several times over the last 6 years, so my star rating is based on my overall experiences. THE PROS: Very big menu with a lot of variety. I usually always order the Crunchy Mui Bueno, Tuna Tempura, and Sea Bass Yakitori. I love the sauce that comes w/ the tempura, and the Sea Bass Yakitori is sooooo delicious it melts in your mouth! I LOVE techno music so the music that is always blaring is super fine with me! The fried ice cream is also to die for! Whatever you do, DON""T forget to order the plum sake! It is served warm and it gives you the best warm, fuzzy feeling ever! (if you drink enough! lol) It's usually pretty lively in there which is also fine with me because I prefer to ALWAYS feel like I'm at a party. THE CONS: Although the food is USUALLY good, I have experienced times where the sea bass yakitori is TINY and the rolls are so huge you can't eat them in one bite. And for anyone who eats sushi rolls you know having to bite into one pretty much makes it fall apart. I've never had anything that actually TASTED bad, though. I have experienced waiters at times who take forever, forget you, and leave your food on the counter 10 min before they bring it to you. A few years back they always used to sing and make  a lot of noise (literrally) for your birthday. 5 years ago they even gave me a $25 giftcard for my birthday when I celebrated there. A couple years ago I made a reservation a few days in advance for my birthday because we were going to have about 10 people in our group. When we got there they had no recollection of the reservation and it still took 20 or so minutes to even get a table. :(  Last couple of years it doesn't seem like they do much for birthdays.  Overall I think Ru San's is a fun place with good sushi and a cool atmosphere. Perfect start to a night of fun!!",2
3,"Had dinner with three family members. Lovely evening on the deck.  Service was fine as always.  Unfortunately, the veal parm I ordered wasn't.  It was dry and tasteless. To be fair my table mates enjoyed their dinners.  Drinks were good as was our dessert a profiterole.   But I can't help the thought that something as straightforward and usual as veal parm should be great every time at a good restaurant specializing in Italian food.",1
2,"This review isn't for the hotel this review is for the Tiki Bar,pool bar area.I give them 2 stars: One star for location and one star for the DJ since he was doing a good job. We were looking for a place to watch the sunset and were attracted by the location of the hotel plus the music. Word of caution to parents: this place isn't for kids as we learned the hard way since we were planning to eat some appetizers while watching the sunset. The waitresses after ignoring us for a while one of them came to our table and asked us how we got in, and we said: thru the door. And she said how the bouncer let us in? And I said: there was no bouncer. So we were asked to leave, simply like that because we were with a kid/minor.  If the bouncer was doing his job he could have told us that before crossing the door that kids aren't allowed unless you are a hotel guest! Or put a sign at the hotel entrance about it. Oh well, we left, walked further and found another hotel nearby were we spent our hard earned money. Not coming back; with or without kids.",0
4,We took pizza home the first time and ate in the restaurant for our second visit. The pizza is thin crust and cooked in a gas fired oven similar in style to wood fired pizza ovens. The pizza is very good. The GF crust was OK and the salads average. One very noticeable thing for me was the lack of a recycling bin for the plastic and glass containers. We took all our recycling home. Please provide recycling at your restaurants.,2
4,"Took my daughter here for lunch, and of course, cake. Beautiful boutique-type setting. Service was excellent. The lunch offerings change daily and are very fresh and flavorful. I had the roasted red pepper and goats cheese quiche, highly recommend. The choices of cakes, pies, bars, and cookies are abundant, making it very hard to choose just one! Only recommendation is to offer a dessert ""sampler.""",2
4,"Great food and service- food was fast, fresh, and delicious!  Great brunch spot- you can't go wrong!",2
5,"We tried these at the Collingswood Art Festival this weekend. they are a bit pricey, but worth it. The flavor is perfect. they aren't greasy. I will be seeking them out. Once you try them... you will want to have them again. they are a light cheddar curd, battered and friend. You don't taste grease or batter. the flavor of the cheese is delicious, and so stringy and melty. The sauces are a delicate compliment to the curd. Well worth the splurge.",2
5,"I'm definitely a fan of Kobe! You get a good bang for your buck- salad, soup, grilled vegetables, noodles, fried rice, and your protein entree all for once price! The thing that does it for me more so than Benihana are the more affordable prices and the yum yum sauce! That yum yum sauce is made from the gods. You put the sauce on your veggies, noodles, rice, and protein. Since it's so much food, I break it up and eat half there and take the rest for lunch the next day. Make sure to ask for yum yum sauce to go. The happy hour specials are pretty great. It includes some wine and cocktails along with a few appetizers. You have to sit by the bar area but it has a few TVs so it's entertaining at the least. Another tip- sign up for their mailing list for a $30 off coupon during your birthday month. Since the prices are affordable, the $30 enables you to purchase a pricier menu item like scallops, filet mignon, and even lobster. Your birthday coupon also includes a  little cupcake!",2
5,"I took my gf for our one year anniversary here,  this cute little hidden  away restaurant was fantastic. Wasn't too uptight, wasn't snobbish, our waiter was very easy going and greeted us by name as we entered. The food was wonderful, and the wine list extensive. Will definitely returnAlso the desert crepes made at the table were fantastic!",2
4,"Melllew atmosphere, 16+ seats at bar, less than 10 tables, damn near best salmon skin in Reno/Sparks - no one can eat only one, everything  tasted fresh, right amount of rice 0n rolls and nigiri, price was right was well, great value for cost. South Reno's best hands down",2
4,"Good solid food.  I enjoy lunch here at least once a week.    If you are in the Cummins Station area get lunch here.   Good food, good service.",2
4,"I had the traditional breakfast (two eggs, bacon, toast, and fruit) and split the french toast with friends. It was good. I have to say my favorite part was their English Breakfast Tea made with a french press and fresh honey. Delicious. It's slightly on the pricey side but you are in Santa Barbara in the touristy section.",2
5,"I don't care what other people say, I really had a good experience at the Texas Roadhouse.  FYI:  The cheeseburgers are very good!",2
4,"I wasn't expecting to but I really liked this place.  The service is fantastic, the menu is quite good as well (it's the sort of place where anyone can find something they like), and it seems very clean.  I've eaten here maybe three times, and the food is consistently tasty and fresh.My main complaint is the atmosphere -- it's pretty dark and the decor is not very modern.  Given the menu, a more open, airy, and modern decor would be more appropriate.  Also, there are no windows in the place that I remember, so it seems pretty dark, though some might call it cozy?  But I suppose that's all more personal preference than anything else.All in all, a great place for dinner and lunch.",2
2,"We have often eaten at this Chili's and I've had what I thought were excellent ribs - ""fall off the bone good"".  However, yesterday we stopped for dinner there and I had a Custom Combo comprising a half rack of Chili's ""Original"" ribs and grilled salmon with sides of mashed potatoes and broccoli.  The ribs were tough and poorly prepared, clearly not slow cooked -  and just not very flavorful.  The mashed potatoes were rather gummy - the broccoli and salmon were OK.  Service was good - we had an attentive and friendly waiter but he could not make up for a below average meal.  Not sure we will go back again.",0
1,"I haven't eaten here in a while because a friend of mines quit, due to rude employers. But I was just starving. I went to order an omelette with the veggies wrapped inside instead of cooked in. I was told that I could not have it that way. Once I asked why??? Both cashiers snapped at me and told me that the cook had the right to make it however he pleased and couldn't I see how busy they were. And they didn't have anytime to special make my order.... After a verbal argument between me and the staff the had to nerve to ask if I still wanted to order. This place has good food but very very poor customer service skills. I will never spend my money there ever again... The worst service I have ever received.",0
4,"I am so glad that there are a few Moe's in South Jersey. I discovered Moe's when I lived in Southwestern Florida and I have been a fan ever since. The staff always gives you a warm greeting when you walk through the door and I never have to wait long for service. They have a diverse menu and the ingredients are always fresh. I like that you have a choice of chicken, tofu, ground beef, pork or steak for all of their entrees. Another good thing to mention is that they provide a few gluten-free alternatives as well as vegetarian options. Their salsa bar gives you a choice of four different salsas to go with your nachos and entrees. This is a great place for people who don't know much about southwestern food or people that would  love a healthier alternative than Taco Bell.",2
5,"Stumbled upon this place while walking around Philly. Way cool toy store!! They had unique and interesting toys- stuff you can't find at a Toys R Us. We went in there as adults and even found a couple new games. Definitely worth stopping in. They even put a cute joke outside, just ask an employee for the punch line. Very cute!",2
4,"Oh Chickie's and Pete's, you are the perfect place to watch some sports and indulge. No doubt this is not the best food I've ever had but, if you can get a seat, grab some beer with mussels red and crab fries, there's no way not to thoroughly enjoy this place during a game or any time you're down by the stadiums. My favs are the crab fries, mussels red (white is overloaded with garlic that I can't always take it), the spicy pull and peel shrimp, steamers, and if the mood is right the blue crabs (it's a lot of work but tasty). This place also makes getting down and dirty with your food easy. There are sinks all over so you can rinse the mess off your hands once you're done....good touch.To sum it up, Chickie's and Pete's is a Philadelphia institution and always a good time. I strongly suggest going at least once to enjoy the experience. Please note: Make sure to remember two things before coming during major sporting events. 1. You'll never get a table and 2. You'll deal with a ton of drunk people. I've absolutely been one of these people before and we can get annoying unless you're in the right frame of mind. :)",2
5,"I discovered Dr. Baird's office days after the doctor's office opened I believe sometime in 2001.   The office looks much like it did 10 years ago when it was brand new as it is impeccably maintained, super clean & the equipment is still state-of-the-art.  This is not the dentist office you grew up with to say the least.    I look forward to my dental visits both with the staff at check-in & Val and Dr. Baird with the care in the back.  My teeth are in tip top shape and routine care is always a fun experience due to their care provided and knowledge shared on oral care between the 6 month visits.  After 10 going on 11 years of being a patient I will only trust Dr. Baird & Val to care for my teeth for many years to come.   (Kid friendly too!)Do you look forward to going to the dentist?  I do. They are that great here!",2
4,"Pleasantly surprised by the presentation of the nice selections.  If I were not here for a biz trip, I would be planning my next visit back!  Good food!",2
3,"Ordered a Kobe burger with wild boar bacon and cheddar. The burger was good but not cooked correctly. I ordered the burger rare but it was raw. It could have used another 3 minutes on the grill. The truffle fries were very well flavored with truffle oil but were a little soggy/under cooked. The place was very busy and they got the food out quickly but I would have waited another 5 minutes to correct the problems above. Also, the floor was wet and very slippery. Walk with caution. Since it was the end of the night the place was a little dirty. The tables and floor could have been wiped down.",1
5,Perfect spot in Nashville! So sad it will be gone soon! Perfect mix of dive bar and music! Everyone was friendly ! We tried to get back later but the rain got the best of us!,2
5,"The food is very good, especially for the price. It's nicely flavored and healthier than most other places for the price. The service is amazing as well, as the two ladies who run the restaurant are extremely personable.",2
1,"Bait and switch! Buyer beware - falsely advertised price!  Went with a friend to check out a used Honda odyssey with an Internet advertised price ($24,999). Friend called the day before to confirm that the car was there and the price before we drove over an hour to get there. We checked out the car it was very nice and we were ready to buy when he dropped the real price on us of $34,600 - a HUGE difference! We could get a new car for that price!  The salesman said sorry that must be a typo but was unapologetic or willing to negotiate. Of course he was willing to show us something else. Stay away from these low sales tactics and spend your money somewhere else!",0
5,Very friendly clean a must for all your nail needs.  Open 6 days comfortable chairs warm towels. Don't pass this Salon up man are welcome too,2
4,"Great established bakery for cannoli's (prepared fresh), slices of pizza, cakes and bread. Quality is very good and prices very reasonable.",2
4,"If you like soon do bu (soft tofu soup with meat), I highly recommend this place. I couldn't give it 5 stars because there was not enough meat. I got the seafood tofu and there was like 2 shrimps and 2 clams in the entire soup. Soon do bu was only $10 for any kind (maybe that's why there wasn't much meat?). Broth is delicious. I recommend cracking the raw egg and mixing it  into the broth. I also got the galbi, it was really flavorful!",2
2,"We  have given up.  Served dirty wine glasses more than once.  Find out the keg is kicked after you order and wait for the beer.  The burgers at better at the burger chains, juicer and they never seem to cook to the right temp.  Management needs to step it up.",0
4,"I don't think there is anything in this place that is particularly healthy, but I can't get enough of their pork belly slider - fantastic.  Donuts are really fine too.  A good lunch spot.",2
5,"Order and drink every craft cocktail one by one. You'll be happy to pull your gelatinous body into the Uber by the time you're done. Our server was a lioness who was born to roar behind the counter. She made my smoked Old Fashioneds the way Beethoven stroked the ivory...fast and fearless. The very next time I land in St Pete I know right where I'm headed, and you should too if you know what's good for you. This place could make a Quaker drink.",2
4,"Still talking about their jambalaya. Best my buddy and I had ever had. No joke. I don't take saying ""the best"" lightly. Even now I'm salivating thinking about it.I'll definitely go back for it. The Oxtail nachos with roasted oyster mushrooms and gouda bechamal were also really great.The interior was a little kitschy for my taste, the fake fireplace things in the booths. Most synthetic plasticky things really turn me off. I also sat against the window and couldn't quite find a comfortable pocket to center myself.Server lady was really sweet.We went on a saturday during jazz fest and though the bywater could be considered a bit off the beaten path, i was rather surprised they weren't slammed.that jambalaya though. hot damn. It's the best thing I ate all week, better than my cochon butcher sandwich, better than that legit poboy, ...and when I come back to town, I'll be back for it. with an extra order to go. for real. nom nom nom.",2
5,"A terrific place to grab a quick bite to eat. Friendly, fast and reasonable prices for the quality they serve up. It the best chick-fl-a I have ever gone to. Most likely because of consistent service of their staff. The manager ""Chris"" is always working his tail off to make sure everything is running as normal. I must say to ""Chris"" thanks for all the support thru the years....you are the best. You have the cleanest, friendliest, all around best restaurant that I know is always there for our family to get a perfect meal...fast!",2
3,"We went to this restaurant after running in the Philadelphia marathon.  We had a large group (12) with us including kids (ages 10-14), parents and grandparents.   The place is very clean and looks fairly new or at least newly decorated.  The service was excellent and friendly.  The food was very good for the parents but everything was on the spicy side which was not so great for the kids and grandparents.  The lighting was very dim which was an issue for the grandparents reading the menu.  The Veggie wings were great as were the cactus and sweet potato burritos.   The guacamole was very good although the spicy chips were a little too much.They offer pitchers of margaritas which was great for our large group.",1
4,"Cute remodel - nice decor, some of the wait staff was friendly, others not so.  It was hot in there!  We sat at the sushi bar right by the AC thermostat.  It read 77 degrees at 7:30 pm on a July night!  I didn't like that our waiter tried handing us the check when we were still waiting for my husband's last dish.  He even still had his chopsticks in his hands!  Once the chef shook his head at him, he walked away.My husband ordered the ""all raw feed me"" for $60, which was 5 dishes.  They were all crafted with a lot of thought, tons of flavor, and precision in the plating.  The last dish was New Zealand king salmon, which came in fresh that day.  All of the fish was super fresh.The portions were VERY SMALL- more like a tasting.  He was still hungry afterwards.  I got the dumplings, which were very delicious and also the ""monkey"" salmon dish.  It was good as well, but the portions again were small.  All of the fish was sliced thin and small in size.   I'd say go once to experience LUVI, but if you like to eat sushi/sashimi like we do, find another place.  It's too pricy for what you get.",2

3,"We just had dinner at Avalon on a suggestion from our friends.  We had 715 reservations and were a couple minutes late, but we were seated immediately which was nice. Karen our server was great, very knowledgable and very helpful in deciphering the ""chefs choice"", menu. We had meatballs, mussels, cheese platter and buffalo chicken crisps which were good, and for our main menu, my wife had linguini and clams and I had lamb bolognese. All good but not great as the price implicated. For $75 per person without tip and drinks I expect to be wowed by the food which I was not.  Nice quaint place and friendly staff.",1

Outside seating with music loud enough to drown out thoughts of my To Do List.4.  Great for groups.5.  Cheap beer.What I don't come to SATCO for:1.  Authentic Mexican food.2.  A quiet lunch.3.  A Vandy student-free lunch.4.  Their guacamole dip.Yep, that about sums it up!",0
5,"Having an awesome stay. Had to be somewhere very early so I parked in the valet and brought my bags into the lobby hoping they could hold them for me until check in. Turns out, they had a room available, and I was able to get right in around 6am. Truly grateful as I woke up at 4:00 this morning so getting a 30 minute power nap on the comfy hotel bed before heading out was a real treat. The room is nice. I like the layout. Very open with lots of windows. Magnificent views of the city and you don't hear traffic at all from the upper levels. I ordered room service and the food was great. Later, I accidentally locked myself out of my room and security helped me get back in. They checked my ID to make sure it was actually my room, which is good practice. I was apologetic but the security guy was so nice. Everyone I've interacted with today has been a joy. I wish I remembered the valet's name this morning. He was wonderful. This is my first time at the Loews and I'll definitely be back! The staff is incredibly kind and accommodating. My room is clean, my bed is comfy, and I'm happy. Thanks Loews!",2
5,"This places never lets me down, I love their cilantro rice and there chicken sandwich is amazing! I add the yellow sauce to everything! If you haven't been, you must try!",2
5,"Amazing, amazing, awesome, perfect. The juices are as wonderful as the people that make them. Can't recommend this place enough.",2
5,"when my boyfriend casually suggested we go out and rent some videos, i had to stop for a second and ask ""wait, video stores still exist? don't you have netflix?"" of course, i forgot that boyfriend is a cranky old man in training and hates technology. so, i begrudgingly agreed to go to the so-called ""video store"" -- and was pleasantly surprised!Casa Video is awesome :) they have just about any movie you could ask for -- in DVD and VHS format (i know, who still uses VHS? oh well). They also run different promotions, such as 2 for 1 rentals on certain days, and a ""film festival"" where they list off staff picks (while i was there it was black and white movies -- very cool to see the staff members choices!)We rented ALOT of movies while i was there -- mostly zombie movies, our favorite genre. They had ALL the obscure movies I was looking for -- including Fulchi's ""Zombi"", which i didn't see on my first lap through the shelves and was very upset that i couldn't rent it. but i was thrilled when I found it (finally!)Staff is really nice and helpful too, they directed us to the sections where we could find weird subtitled films and exploitation films (certain horror films are considered exploitation, i guess), and even gave us free popcorn! yaay!The only bad/weird thing is that what you see on the shelves is what they have. If it's not there, it means its rented. So, there are basically no backup copies of any movies (with the exception of new releases), so it's every movie hound for themselves.As a bonus (for me) they had just about every B-horror movie i could dream of -- including many I had never heard of! I might have to ditch netflix for Casa Video when I move out there................maybe.",2
5,"Delicious food. Fast and friendly service! We had the el jaffe, banana short stack, and breakfast enchiladas. Everything was perfection. The pork enchiladas were to die for! So yummy. And my pancakes were divine. Cooked to perfection. Nice and fluffy, golden brown. Next time I'm in Reno this is where we'll go for breakfast or lunch! The owner and the 2 other guys working were just so friendly too.",2
5,"Came here on a day it wasn't busy at all and they food was still on point! Little expensive but well worth it, whatever that sauce is I tried to put on everything, the Mac and cheese, rice, chicken, cabbage everything!",2
5,"There are a few things you expect from Chick-Fil-A, friendly service, good food, and a clean restaurant. This is the first time I've been to this new location, and it has absolutely lived up to the corporate standards, and exceeded them. I was at the front of the line only minutes after walking in, and the cashier, Carolina, was friendly and enthusiastic and made me feel very welcome there, unlike other fast food places where the cashiers seems bothered by your business. My food was out in just a couple minutes, and it was hot, fresh, and tasty. This Chick-Fil-a is a great and welcomed addition to Reno, and I hope it stays for a long, long time.",2
5,"We dropped by 21st Amendment for some late-night cocktails in French Quarter without going to the rowdier spots. Given that this was close to where we were staying (the Marriott), it was easy to pop out and roll over to 21st Amendment, which was only a few minutes away. There wasn't a line outside, but it was packed by the time we made it inside (sometime between 10-11 PM)...standing-room only, with the seats at the high-top tables and the bar taken. The decor and ambiance is a bit more retro, but like all New Orleans spots in this fashion, it feels homey, and it was enhanced by the fact that the band in the bar playing live music was absolutely entrancing the audience, with some folks even doing some dancing right at the front.That said, I did come here initially because it was rated highly for drinks, and on that front, the cocktails do not disappoint. The bartenders make the drinks expertly, whether you stay on-menu or stray off by giving some general preferences. The beer selection is more generic, with specific bottles being the big-label brands, and no names given for listings like 'seasonal' or 'IPA'. Nonetheless, the drinks are made quickly but consistently - something I appreciated given how busy it was that night. Pricing was reasonable, relatively speaking - $13 a cocktail is a bit expensive, but the quality was very good, making it a bargain compared to some places in New York that I have been to.21st Amendment really has a nice cozy feel to it, and with great drinks and great music, it's hard to go wrong. It doesn't have the kind of 'fun' you'd find half a block over on Bourbon Street, but at my age, it's the kind of fun that I'd rather have. Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area.",2
4,Best Chelada I've ever tasted! atmosphere is incredibly inviting and the decor is very tres amigos. super cute. We shared tapas: Yaqui sliders- chorizo beef was excellent the bun was a little dry for my liking  Tostadas de Jaiba- more like a crab salad w/lots mayo not lumps of crab - but tasty Barrio jalapeño- hot hot hot and oh so yummy! They made a special not on the kids menu steak and fries for my son! So sweet! Staff incredibly friendly. I'd go back for sure!,2
2,"The venue is fantastic; a beautiful remodeling of a classic building in an easily accessible part of town.Pork tacos were acceptable but the small portions and over priced nature lost them points.Stuffed poblano peppers were undercooked and had meager stuffing.The beer leaves a lot to be desired and is exceedingly overpriced, especially if you want to fill a growler. Good effort in architecture, but we won't be back.",0
3,"We ate here a few days ago and it was good... but not great. Our server was nice and our food came out quickly. I loved the selection of craft sodas they had. We ordered calamari, the Popeye pizza with some added veggies and each had dessert. Our calamari was crispy but not golden brown and not delicious... it was very blonde and greasy, our pizza was ok when it was hot, but the crust was really soggy in the middle and our desserts had to be store bought... my chocolate mousse cake left much to be desired and his key lime pie tasted like sweet custard. No key lime flavor at all. We took the rest of our pizza home to reheat... they soggy crust had become even more soggy and was impossible to eat.... I want to like this place, but don't know if I'll risk wasting my money again.",1
1,"I have currently been sitting in the same chair for 36 minutes waiting for a take out order that consists of one combination plate with hot braised chicken. I haven't ordered anything ridiculous or out of the ordinary, yet here I am. If I didn't already pay for the food or had any confidence in their ability to refund me, I would leave and go elsewhere. I haven't been assured that my food is coming soon, had anyone apologize to me for the wait, or even acknowledge my existence. It's now been 44 minutes since I first sat down and I am being nodded at. I guess that means my order is ready. I'll update this review when I actually get to eat the food.",0
4,"Overall good food and an enjoyable dinner.  One of the few places I've come across that allows you to get fried rice along with lomein in their combo dinners.  Wonton soup and spring roll were just ok, but shrimp lomein, fried rice and general tso's chicken were all tasty.",2
4,"Fastest delivery ever! I ordered my food, went downstairs long enough to have a glass of wine and when I came back to my room they were already there with my good. The good was excellent and at a great price. I highly recommend this place!!!",2
5,"I love this place!! They have really creative and affordable vegan/ vegetarian options, including vegan pastries. And their coffee so amazing.",2
3,"I'm not quite sure I get this place. It's a pub, but doesn't feel like one, and is definitely not priced like one. The live music is cool, but overall this place lacks character.",1
5,My purse strap broke so I stopped to get it fixed at the closest place I could find. They took it immediately and it was ready within 30 min. It was fixed so well that If I hadn't already known the purse strap broke I wouldn't have been able to tell. I am very happy,2
4,"Wow. We came here to end our family vacation, knowing it was going to be pricey. I'd urge everyone to look into the costs up front, so you don't have any surprises on check out. We checked in on a Sunday afternoon, and it was really quick. The rep was knowledgeable and friendly and gave instructions on how to find our room. The room was the cheapest they had, but still really nice, and very clean. We dropped our stuff off and explored. There is so much to see and so much to do. Some of the activies are free, like the fountain show in the evenings, but most aren't, such as the riverboat ride or the spa services. Dinner our first night was at the Cantina. Prices are decent, and the service was good. Our second night we ate at Piaso (pizza). The pizza was good, for the price. Generous servings for $4. Friendly service and a decent selection of wines. There are at least three coffee houses that I counted, and all serve Starbucks coffee. There are three pools - one indoor and two outdoor. The Cascades Outdoor Pool has already 1.5' small pool that was perfect for our three year old, and the larger pool went up to 4'6"" which was great for our 8 year old. There is a great locker room by the Cascades Indoor Pool that has showers, a hair dryer, and restrooms. Overall my family and I had a great time, and I don't regret the money we spent for the two nights we were here (which was a lot). Just do your research, and take the time to see the scenery. It is breathtaking!",2
5,"Just got my alternator replaced by an independent mechanic and turns out my intake tube at the MAF sensor was either loose or not fully connected causing my check engine light to pop my enigine too lean codes.  Took my vehicle to Pep Boys at Smithridge in Reno, NV and they managed to isolate the problem based on what I told them might have happened.  The didn't charge me the full diagnostic fee under those circumstances and only charged me a reduced fee of $50 since the solution was pretty simplified and they gave my vehicle a once over with a multi-point inspection before releasing it back to me.  By isolating the problem no major vacuum test for leaking hoses was required.  The intake hose was something that was not noticeable but did explain a lot especially after just having new alternator installed.Nothing else was pushed on me that day and I wonder had I gone to an independent in town or another garage if I would've been charged more.  I felt the lower diagnositic fee and another once over was well worth it because I didn't want to be driving with any major issues.I feel the staff at Pep Boys was quite professional in this instance and I'd recommend them again in the future.",2
5,"My coworker and I came here the other day after work for spur of the moment pedicures. When we arrived the spa was busy and all of the ladies were with customers. After we picked out our polish, they set up the pedicure stations so we could wait while our feet were soaking. We probably waited for 20 min or so, but it was great because our feet were soaking. The women working did not rush through the other customer's manis and pedis to get to us. We felt very well taken care of and relaxed. Our pedicures were great. We both had the standard pedi which comes with a 10 min leg massage and hot stones for only $25. I will definitely be back here and continue recommending them!",2
5,"Excellent place for gelato! The best there is on St. Louis! Lovely garden patio in the rear, ample seating with tables and armchairs both downstairs and upstairs, with free wifi throughout!",2
5,"Diverse and creative drink menu, and excellently spiced dishes (to live up to the name!) What I like best is how versatile this restaurant can be for the guest. You can come in with a group and have a full and delicious meal, or you pop in for a quick drink and snack at the bar. Either way, you can't go wrong with any menu decision (though I was a huge fan of the yogurt appetizer!) Spice Finch is a welcomed addition to the Philly restaurant scene.",2
3,"Pretty good americanized Italian. The food is ok, but $12 for a plate of spagetti with meat sauce? Considering I can go across the street and eat better Italian for comparable money? Oh and the beef ribs are terrible. Pork ribs are excellent. Strange. The salad bar was ok but way more expensive than I'd consider reasonable.",1
5,"This place has some of the best sushi I've had in the city, hands down. I've been on the hunt for the best sushi in philly and this one may be it. The service is great. Super friendly staff, great lunch specials as well. My schedule is off a lot of days so my  lunches can start late but this restaurant stays open all day which I like. Many other spots close after lunch and don't open again until 5 or 530 for dinner. Overall, great food, great staff, nice environment!Recommended",2
4,Tria was a fun place for a bottle of wine and some cheese.  I would definitely recommend it as a relaxing place to unwind with friends after a work day.,2
3,"I went here for lunch on a saturday afternoon and had a rather forgettable experience. This place looks like it would be a lot of fun with an outdoor seating area for live reggae music and a well-designed interior that that reminds you of the tropics. The prices are on the high side but the food itself is pretty good. The service is just god awful though. We waited 45 minutes from our initial order to get an order of bread  and a drink. It was another 20 minutes to get the actual entrees. The beef ribs and chicken jerk are authentic, reminded me of trips to Jamaica. The rice is so-so and the same for the cabbage and plantains and in my opinion, the coco bread isn't worth it. I would like to give this place a better rating because the point of going there was the jerk chicken but the service was terrible enough to make you regret going. That all being said, I'm planning on going to the live reggae shows they have and ordering take-out when the urge for jerk chicken arises.",1
5,"bar menu and seating was great, Nola traditional experience. Lobster roll terrific - light and fresh. We'll be back.",2
4,"Ok so I lied. There is no falafel here. Went back and got the ziggy burger (eh), crispy chick'n sandwhich (amazing!), quinoa chili (yum), udon salad (eh), and sweet potato fries (pretty good). It's nice to have the option of a vegetarian fast food place because who knows what some of those places put in the mean.",2
5,"I chose Delicious Designs based on the excellent reviews I found on Yelp and I am so very pleased with the results. Leigh Anne kept in constant contact with me about details and the end result was fabulous! Of course I had a special request...that's why I chose to do some investigating. The comments people make mean alot to me and I am very happy that she was able to make (and deliver) my special cake which was a law book with a gavel and tassle. Typically meant for a law student's graduation but we used it to celebrate an attorney's 40 year anniversary. Everyone loved it and asked who made it so a polite suggestion Leigh Anne, when you make cakes from now on, turn it in with a few of your business cards so that the host can hand out your card when people want to know who made it. Ours was white cake with fresh strawberries in a strawberry mousse filling. It was delicious! Thank you so much for all your hard work. You will be hearing from me again.",2

1,Only giving a 1 because there is nothing lower!!! AngieGave me the worst haircut I've ever had!!! I came in with 2 photos of the cut I wanted came out with my hair looking NOTHING like the photos!!  Even when pointed out to her she didn't not pay attention to what she was doing.  Came out basically having a mans flattop!  Would never go to this place again!!! Nothing like going into the Holidays with a crappie haircut. Thank you!! Angie and Regis Hair salon!!,0
4,"Just a fantastic dining experience. The food was so good. I had the shrimp and grits, my mother had the salmon. Both were excellent. The one thing that was truly amazing was the Tanked fish tank. Its an entire wall filled with gulf fish. I will def be coming back here.",2
1,"Went here to redeem Groupon, frist time staff member said she couldn't use system and for me to come back after she extended it. I went back and I was told I was out of luck it expired.  Way to waste my time and very un-Yoga like. I will stick with Wake up Yoga and PSC, they know how to treat people.",0
4,Place is great!! Tacos and burritos and plenty of choices! They have different flavor sauces as well that you can try. All different tastes from mild to hot and also some sweet. It's a great place in Westchase. For sure try it!!,2
4,"I've now been to Margaritaville in Nashville and the Bahamas. I enjoyed both places (even though the menu could use some refreshing from time to time.The only reason I didn't mark this as four stars?I don't know where they buy the shirts they sell, but the one from the Bahamas had a hole in the back within two months, and the one from Nashville I noticed before washing it the first time.For the money I spent on it, I wasn't happy with it.But the spirits were great!",2
4,"Got the apple and bacon pizza. It was really delicious, but the toppings slid off the pizza really easy, so you had to hold it really well to avoid that. The outdoor seating was very nice and the heaters worked well. The waitress seemed a little annoyed, but it was not a big problem. There was no wait on a Sunday night, so we were seated very quickly. Overall a nice experience.",2
1,"Service was slow, forgot my order, took over ten minutes to get drink after ordering which I may add it took about 10 minutes to even get the server over here.....not worth the money at all",0
2,"SImply not impressed.  I got a burger with blue cheese and carmelized onions. The meat was high quality, but the bread to meat to cheese ratio is all wrong.  The burger was very thick and as such left most of the bun meatless.  They could have made the burger thinner, gave it greater circumference, and not left me with a half grilled cheese/half burger scenario. Not a big fan, won't go back/order delivery.  Its simply not a good burger and at $60 for 2 people, I'd rather try the devil I don't know.",0
2,"After a bad storm temporarily shut down our new-to-us favorite coffee shop Pagoda, I decided to give this spot a try.  Won't be back.  Here's why...Location:Look, parking in town can be difficult.  That is no different here.  I found a spot nearby but I've talked to others that had to walk quite a ways to get here.  Just luck of the draw.  Beautiful gardens and homes to look at (duh) so just enjoy the stroll.  I'm not applying this towards my overall scoring but I'm noting it so you know that I know that you know what the deal-i-o is.Atmosphere:Dead silent.  Seriously.  So.  Freaking.  Quiet.  If you need to study then you've found a winner!  If you want coffee and a chat then you need to move it outside or to another spot.When I walked in everyone looked and stared not because they cared about checking out my style or anything but because I made an actual loud noise and it startled them.Not the largest coffee shop but seating inside for probably 30 at max capacity?  Chairs and tables not the comfiest nor the biggest. After I got my coffee from the huffy barista (more on that in the next section because I should really review the product & service I got) I chose a spot to read my new cookbook and just tried to enjoy the stillness.  That was great until the guy behind the counter started a very loud and very angry and very loooooong conversation with someone on his cell phone.  In a space that had up until that moment been as quiet as a church, his voice seemed like it was coming out of a loudspeaker.  Look, I'm nosy but I try to make it look like I'm not obviously nosy but it wouldn't have mattered here.  This guy really got into it and wouldn't have noticed if the roof fell in.  He certainly didn't notice the customers standing at the counter waiting long minutes for him to finish what was very obviously a VERY PERSONAL phone call.  After a few minutes I gave up pretending I wasn't watching and took in the show.  After ignoring the customers for a few minutes he finally ended his call, heaved numerous sighs and 'helped' them with the same care he'd given me.  Spoiler alert: it wasn't indifferent but rather seemingly downright rude.  I watched this play out with a steady stream of folks for the next 30 minutes or so and finally left because all of this was stressing me out a bit.  Not really relaxing, ya?Service:I asked for a large coffee and was trying to decide if I wanted medium, dark or chicory when it appeared in front of me.  If you don't know what you want in the first 2 seconds then they'll just make up your mind for you.  Okkkkkkk.  I watched this happened to a few of the customers after me too.  This guy wasn't really needing to be dealing with the public because there wasn't obviously other stuff going on that made it difficult for him to his job.  Everyone has a bad day but don't take it out out on the customer to the extreme.  I mean, you don't have to kiss my butt but don't be all huffy and DO NOT PICK MY COFFEE FOR ME WITHOUT ASKING.  Rude.Coffee:It was good.  Not great.  Not mind-blowing.  Good.  Not as hot as I prefer but more heat than tepid.  I ended up pouring about 1/4 out because I got some grounds in the finish.I couldn't find spoons and after waiting a moment at the counter to ask (remember, my first time here) and being ignored I just used a straw.  I hate to drink fair-trade coffee that wasn't my choice poured by an angry barista and then throw away plastic when I don't have to.Other:I didn't eat so no word on that.Bathrooms were clean enough.Great restaurants nearby.I really should give the spot 1 star but the cleanliness of the main room, the overall neighborhood area and the outdoor seating bumps it up a notch.  Just know your fair trade coffee can be served with a buttload of snark.",0
5,"A little too ""pretty"", and not an outdoor range are my only negatives.Huge selection, helpful staff, decent prices, training classes, full auto rental guns.Updated 2018 : They made it even better. Moved the rental guns to an easy to see case away from the cashier, decreasing clutter and wait time. Definitely the best range/shop I've ever been to.",2
1,"I gave this restaurant 5 stars 3 years ago. Since then I have had several dinners and parties there and recommend them to multiple friends. But after the second horrible experience there I have to speak out. (Last year I was racially profiled. The waitress would not let us in and asked me if I was able to pay the restaurant minimum. Her attitude changed immediately after my Chinese husband showed up.) I let the first incident slide but this one sent me through the roof. I just helped my friend's family plan a 40th birthday party for her and the night manager was one of the rudest people I've ever met. Let me preface that my husband and his family know him from many years of working in Chinatown and we've always helped support his business. To make a long story short: I booked a birthday party for 7:00. The family came early to set up, as he said it was allowed. At 6:30 he came in yelling that we have to leave at 9:00 because he has someone coming in and we can't stay there all night. I reminded him that we have a 7:00 reservation and that we spoke several times to confirm and he said ""So what I don't care, it doesn't matter be out by 9."" He was yelling at me across the restaurant. He was so unprofessional and hurtful, especially since we've always supported this business. At 8:55 he came in and said we could stay longer, but I couldn't even look at him and everyone was ready to leave anyway. His verbal abuse practically ruined my night. I love the food and the karaoke room, but tonight was my last visit there. I STRONGLY recommend another restaurant. There are so many other restaurants that will give you the Chinatown experience and not treat you and your guests like crap. So, so, disappointed!",0
5,"This is hands down THE best Thai Restaurant in the area and quite frankly,  anywhere.  The food is delicious and has become our go-to comfort food. Try the Red Curry and Drunken Noodles.  By far the tastiest anywhere!  The owners and staff are so kind and friendly and make everyone feel like family. I'd give them 10 stars if I could!",2
4,"I've been to 3 nights markets so far: Chinatown 2011, Mt. Airy 2012, Chinatown 2012 and can't wait for it to return this summer. The experience is awesome. Crowds of people, lines of food trucks, live music. Always a great time.My favorite experience was my first in Chinatown, mainly based on the food that I had. I have no idea which truck I got this from, but I have been dreaming about the butternut squash and sweet potato lasagna I had almost 2 years ago. Heavenly. Other standouts were a variety of tacos from Guapos Tacos...despite the long ass line, and corn on the cob straight from the grill.Mt. Airy was also great. Great, hilly street with food trucks going on forever. Standouts included Margherita pizza from Nomad and korean tacos.Can't wait to go this coming season, hopefully in a spot I haven't been before.",2
2,"Not so impressed.Seared tuna was good, but just a bit weird atmosphere.",0
5,"Had a great time here. The food was fantastic, and the view was superb. The waitress seemed genuinely happy to be working here and was extremely friendly. No complaints.",2
3,"If I based my review only on my meal, I'd have to give it one star.  But everyone else in my party of 10 enjoyed their meal, and we had a great time.  I ordered the vegetarian meal, and it was the WORST veggie meal I've ever had :(  My meal came with soup and rice, just like everyone else, but when the others got their choice of meat I got a plateful of sliced red peppers.  That's all.  Sliced red peppers.  Uh,   how about some mushrooms or zuchini or squash or about a million other veggie options.  Fortunately, I'd had enough sake bombs not to get too upset about it!",1
4,"Excellent tasting Po-Boys but it could have had mire catfish, pretty skimpy.Service, very good.",2
5,"Some of the finest Mexican food I've had. The fried fish taco is WONDERFUL, as is all of the other food. My biggest regret is not buying their red sauce and birria to take home. Also-there is no air conditioning. They do have ceiling fans, but we all know those aren't necessarily helpful in the monsoon season. The food is definitely worth the trip though!",2
5,I used to visit the Italian Kitchen every day on my way to work. The staff was always friendly and the food is incredibly good. I have lived in California since 2007 and we still talk about the Italian Kitchen and do our best to pop in when we visit South Jersey. Don't miss their pizza or their hot and cold sandwiches. And don't get me started on the desserts!,2
5,"I very rarely eat fast food but when I need that fix, Chick-fil-A is it.  I just had their chicken biscuit and was very happy, the Chick-fil-A standard for being clean, prompt, tasty and courteous is well met here, the staff is doing an awesome job and I really appreciate it because it is so far the opposite of what I find at many other places.",2
5,Such a great place to meet and catch-up with friends and colleagues.  Steven is an amazing bartender!  Such great company!,2
1,Dean's Service was not professional or reliable at all.  I called to get a diagnosis and they got to my rental property and gave me misinformation.  I left messages for Jenny to call me back to get an estimate and a good time to complete the repair and I am still waiting for her to call me back.I had to call another company to do what Dean's Service was unable to do.  I will never call them back again nor would I refer them to anyone.,0
5,"Immaculate work. They fixed issues that didnt even relate to  the damage from my accident. the rubber lining on my rear window, my arm rest in the car was broken, all the scratches on the door handles were gone. 5 star would come back.",2
4,Great service and people here! Got my nails done here for the first time and had a great first impression. Would go again for sure.,2
2,"I loved coming here when it was in the old location with my mother. Delicious food. The manicotti is creamy, not dry and flaky cheese like most places these days. Since they moved I have come whenever I was down to visit. This review is not about food, which is very good, but customer service. I came in a few minutes after closing, with people being served plates, just starting to dig in, not looking like they would leave any time soon. They wouldn't seat me. They wouldn't even do take out. I had wanted the special. They probably could have scooped it from the tray. No fuss no muss. I only get here twice a year now. Not even take out? Really? Guess business is great.",0
4,"Great food but it is a little touristy. I am spoiled because I am a local and go to the spongedocks a lot. If this is your first time in the area, Hella's is a must. Even if only for their bakery. If i could write a separate review for bakery, it would be 5 star",2
4,"We stayed at the Sheraton and they recommend this place. It was really great. I had the sampler and it was amazing, especially the crawfish ettouffe ! My husband had the shrimp and grits and he loved it. The staff was very friendly, I will definitely come again.",2
5,"Moved down to St. Pete about two months ago from CT and saw the reviews on Yelp so I had to check it out and I was not disappointed,  have gone back twice now and will keep going back..Awesome place, neat and clean and they know how to cut hair..",2
5,"As avid brewery connoisseurs and current Nashville locals, we were extremely and pleasantly surprised with our experience at Tennessee Brew Works this evening. It was a dreary, rainy night and as we pulled up we were fairly apprehensive about the string of dark warehouses and quiet alleys. It all changed quickly as we walked into the ""Tennessee Fill Station"" (or some name similar) portion of the building. The fellas working there directed us to the ""Tennessee Tap Room"" (or some name similar) portion of the building that overlooked 2 stories into the ""Tennessee Brew Works"" (or some name similar) portion of the building where the brewing takes place. I've added the specifics because this is the first group audacious and clever enough to pull off all three portions under one roof.... and to still comply with Tennessee's archaic liquor laws! If sticking it to the man isn't enough reason for you to check it out.... keep reading. The tap room is super neat and cleverly laid out with patios, long & community-oriented tables, a flying bridge or ""catwalk"" and a steady stream of live, local music. It's largely non-smoking (which is enough to convince me to cross the bridge from East Nashville) and has a few TVs to cater to the football crowds. Biggest fortes:- The staff is amazing. The smiles and enthusiasm when they start talking about their beer are a sweet relief. They're excited! They're adventurous! They aren't pretentious. Real People.- The beers are fresh & different. They keep it local. They aren't afraid to venture from the norm. They add their own zing and flair.... and for that, I respect them.- They appreciate the food & beer pairing concept. They're bringing in great food to compliment their brews. It's a movement.If you've managed to read all of that rambling- you can ignore any other reviews and just go ahead and get there.",2
1,"Wow let's start at the top. Walk in to put name down. I can see it's a wait. Get zero eye contact from the hostess with 4 other younger girls doing all the work I ask to put my name down. And was told it's 35 minutes. We wait and Get seated and order drinks. Get 1/2 of the drinks (water) waited 15 minutes for the milk and lemonade. Order right away. Took over 45 minutes for that to come out. Cold,soggy, waited to get refill of water and asked 2 times before my wife asked again. Then brings the water with old food stuck to the inside off the glass. Just about turns my stomach. Rethink going here.",0
3,"They got me in fast, but a little careless on scratching my brand new Shimano 105 crankset.  No apologies or offers to fix.  Just let it go.",1
1,"This has been an awful experience. We walked in around 1:30 pm and we waited for our drinks for 40 minutes and had to remind the waiter three times. Half of our table received their meals while the other half had to wait an extra 20 minutes. There were two tables here and a few at the bar, not busy at all. The table behind us walked out due to the awful service, and I'm currently wondering why I didn't. never going back",0
5,The cinnamon roll is to die for. Seriously. Must get. Also loved the breakfast buns stuffed with sausage and bacon.,2
5,"Great service & nice, large rooms. Everyone was helpful, good for large groups & corporate groups with events - but, construction during the day (new restaurant opening February 2015, week after our stay) and only 1 of 2 elevators worked.",2
4,"P Chart:Place: 4Really good looking French country feel but not over done. They also have a great patio which is perfect on nice days. Good for a casual datePeople: 4Nice, quick and attentive. Waiter came through with a custom choice off the menu during a busy breakfast rushProvisions: 5Food was terrific. Very fresh and flavorful eggs bene was killer and was the grass fed  silver burger. Nothing here disappoints. Price: 5Great food at a reasonable rate. Tough to find this quality at this price. Performance: 5 Get the bacon!  With so little choice for great food on the main line this one ranks among the best for great semi casual food. You will be very pleased and will return",2
2,"Is there actually a good place to find breakfast in Nashville? My wife and I tried two places, and they were both marginal. Prime 108 was one of them.Looking at the ratings from dinner-goes, I'm sure Prime 108 is a fine place to have a steak, but for breakfast it left a lot to be desired. Let's start with having to stand in line in the lobby for about twenty minutes while the hostess takes her sweet time escorting people to their tables, then going to chat with some of the waiters for far too long before coming back for the next guest. Mind you, that's tolerable when the restaurant is packed, but when I can clearly see that there are at least 10 empty tables from my place in line behind four other groups (with two other groups behind us), that kind of lethargy in seating guests is unacceptable.The food and service from the waiter were also nothing spectacular. Our waiter was nearly as slow as the hostess and every time he approached our table he looked like he'd rather be anywhere else than working in that restaurant. Beyond that, the quality of the food was average at best. Particularly disappointing was the tartness of the fruit in the compote. Probably should have been checked before serving it to guests.",0
5,I have been a fan of Chateau La Vin for a few years. It has been fun to watch the place evolve. At first it was more of a wine store with only a few tables. Now it has been transformed into a wine bar. He offers cheese and crackers and people order from the local restaurants and some of them even deliver. He had two guys playing music. He offers so many different wines and is willing to share his knowledge. My friend is a beer drinker and he has a nice variety for them as well. He does have a few tables out in front. This is a great place.....,2
4,"I had a most-delicious bagel sandwich this morning - pork roll, egg and cheese on an everything bagel. The price was very fair - $4.23 - and the bagels are made on site each day. They seem understaffed so hopefully they get some more staff to keep up with the crowds.",2
4,Delicious! I had the famous cream cheese ice cream topped with fresh strawberries and whipped cream. Definitely worth a visit.,2
5,Awesome spot and off the beaten touristy path in Nashville. Will be my first stop when I come back to visit,2
4,"I'm in town for an OB/GYN conference and really wanted to explore the local gems - oh Yelp you make travel so much better.  I was on my way to grab lunch and passed by a cute window display and decided I would come their for dessert and coffee.  I'm a coffee snob - Peet's in the Bay Area, Intelligencia in Chicago, Dunn Bros. etc.. and the coffee here was pretty good - just a shade lighter roast than Peets.  I also picked up some Amaretti cookies to share but once I tried them decided to keep them - light airy buttery almond flavored little circles of joy.  I plan to go back before I leave and get some delicious treats to take home!",2
5,"After living in the STL area for way over 10 years now, I am both ashamed and remorseful to admit that I ate here for the FIRST time just a few weeks ago. I am ashamed because it's a St. Louis tradition and remorseful because I missed out on it for so..many...years! This place is amazing. What is not to love! It's a factory where you can get a tour (Friday-Sunday, noon-5pm on the hour), there's a shop, bar, and dining area. They also host many event with live music on the weekends. It's fun to just kind of wander and look around - don't worry, you'll get a chance because there will likely be a wait before you dine. The beer is, of course, amazing. The Hefeweizen is my personal favorite and a great start for anyone who is not a huge beer drinker (like myself). Additionally, the food is homegrown and damn good. I had the pizza (recommendation from my server) and it was really spectacular, though I'm admittedly a pizza connoisseur so I enjoy a good pizza pie more than most probably ;P My date had a bison burger which was also really good. More fun info: the service is great! I think they tend to hire more funky and alternative people (like tattoo parlor staff) which I support. The quality is what makes this place stand out along with the emphasis on local food and brewery. It is a little on the pricier side but for all the experience you get and the quality, it is worth it. I will go again and again and you probably should, too!",2
1,"The owner of Popeyes used to send his mother to the drive thru once a week and report irregularities.  This bk must be a corporate store because of corporate like employees serving a human population.Soggy (or oil tainted) tater tots, but everything else is made fresh.  That means EVERY customer has to ""please pull around because they are so fresh they are just coming out of the oven"".   Then they forget caramel in a specialty coffee, or a drink that goes with the combo they are holding.  Breakfast is a disorganized mess.  Definitely not a place you want to go when you are in a hurry.  It's a slow food, or pull around & wait establishment....would not recommend to anyone for breakfast.  Maybe it was due to the Monday's????",0
4,"Located right at the Union Station Metro stop (walking distance to all of downtown but metro-able too), this place was a good deal on the weekend.  Prices spike during the week when business-peeps fly in and their companies are paying the bill.  The room was clean, the bed was super comfy with TONS of pillows (one sure way to my heart).  The bathroom was large with a tub and too many white towels for two people.  Subtracted one star cause the coffee machine in our room sucked and the door was thin so you could hear people/children in the hall at WAY too early in the morning.  The main lobby is really a cool place tho.  Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area.",2
4,"Arrived late in town and this was the perfect spot for a reasonably priced, quick meal. My husband had a double burger with a grilled cheese in the middle! I had a zydeco dog, both we good. It was quite loud, but the NCAA games were on. Definitely worth a stop in if you are looking for a good, decent priced burger.",2
5,Fun place to dance and get drinks. Bands are good. The DJ is awesome. Drinks are reasonably priced. Good place to check out on a Friday night.,2
3,"The service was not bad, it did however have a line that went out the door. I suggest going here for your morning coffee and cookie fix.",1
4,"Chilis has pretty good food , consistently decent food at a fair price . Happy hour is not bad . Try the chili .",2
4,"Tired of eating junk for lunch? When you crave something healthy this is a good choice. Great salads, cold wraps and hot burritos. Yummy tomato basil soup. Plenty of  fresh juice choices.",2
1,"I came here with my family today with total of 5 people.  Service was decent and food was okay. When the bill came I noticed there was 18% gratuity already added to the bill. I questioned the server where this automatic gratuity info was posted since it was no where to be found inside the restaurant or on the menu.  She told me the gratuity info was posted on their website.  I told her people don't go on to the website to look for this info and I felt cheated.  After I left I went to their website and looked for the info, well it was no where to be found!  I called back and asked her to direct me to this info on their website and she then says it's posted on Yelp!  I told her  Yelp is not your website and I am going to call my credit card company for dishonest business practice.She said if you come back now I will refund your tip, I told her I already left and can't and will not turn around.  She said well then we can't do any refund.  After going back and forth, another lady came to the phone and I told her I will give my cc number and she will run the refund.  Look on Yelp and there is no info on the gratuity!  What a dishonest restaurant!I normally tip at least 15% and I just do not appreciate this kind no of practice!  When did it become automatically adding 18% for 5 or more?  Isn't the norm for party of 8?",0

4,"Great miso soup, sushi was fresh, food was fast, Nothing mind blowing, but good quality. I ordered take out, so I cannot comment on the service but to say that everyone was exceptionally polite.",2
3,"It's more of a solid 3.5 stars.  This was our first time at the jersey location.  It was very spacious, clean, and empty.  Well, it was a Tuesday night and there were only about 4 other patrons there; we had the whole back room to ourselves.  We ordered quite a bit for two.  We started with scallion pancakes, meh i've had better.  It was nothing special.  The guy had the spicy beef noodle soup, beef was braised as well.  The broth was delicious and spiciness level was a 5.  When he asked the waiter if the size was comparable to pho the waiter did not have a clue to what pho was.  You work in an asian resto my dude!  Granted this is not a viet joint, but you should be well rounded about asian cuisine overall.  Anyway, the dan dan noodle is a staple when dining at Han's, the spiciness level was a 6 and they accommodated me by not adding meat to it.  I also ordered the spicy cucumber, spiciness level was a 6.  After one helping i was over it.  The garlic overpowered the rest of the flavosr as i kept munching on it.  My eyes locked in on the salt and pepper shrimp entree so i had to order it.  I love this dish.  The minced pepper and onion just heightens the flavor of the shrimp.  Shame that it was on the pricey side, $19.95.  I think there were only about 10 pieces of shrimps.  The guy had a chicken entree that he liked, nothing special.  We ended up having leftovers cause we wanted to try different things.  I think next time i'll just stick to the lunch menu or take out.",1
5,"These guys rock! I originally try to book with aqua sports, but they were booked solid. They referred me to Santa Barbara Adventure Company and I could not have been more satisfied. Our guide Adam was professional and extraordinarily informative. You could tell he had a real passion for his job and shared his knowledge of the history of the island and its local inhabitants. I seriously considered bringing my own kayak and going it alone but I'm so glad I didn't. I went in areas that I never would have considered, but never felt forced to do so. Our group had approximately's five kayaks and all of us were novices. I consider myself an intermediate just because I'd been in kayaks before but after the trip I realized how much I really didn't know! Adam was very patient and never forced anyone to do anything they weren't comfortable doing, and I never felt rushed. These guys deserve six stars. I give Santa Barbara Adventure Company my highest rating!",2
5,"Everytime I'm in Santa Barbara, this place is the best for good food and a great view.... Nothing like enjoying a good meal while listening to the ocean!",2
3,Horrible for the most part. I ordered $50 worth of food and 27 was eatableThe fried rice was soapy The duck bun that was $8 alone was gross and I love duck The sushi was $5 for two pieces I ordered $15 worth 6 pieces it had next to no rice but the fish was awesome very fresh that alone gave them the two stars I would give half a star for the miso He ordered a sushi roll he said it was pretty good again the fish was great 1star for this review I won't go back because I would rather drive to Tampa and go to I ai sushi for cheaper higher quality food.,1
5,"These are the best acai bowls maybe on earth. Where does acai come from? Maybe it's better there, but you probably can't get them as beautiful. And you can get anything off this menu (even the spinach one!) and it is reliably fantastic. No stray seeds (a smooth blend), no weird chalky flavor (tempered properly with honey), and fresh fruit. I wish they didn't close early but I get it.Plus they do stamp cards!",2
4,"It doesn't strike me as very authentic but you get a ton of (tasty) food for very little money. I ordered a Horchata and it was insanely huge, maybe 1/4 a gallon.",2
4,"We were on the top floor - 14th. Large, spacious, clean rooms. I would definitely return and stay here again. I liked that you needed to use the room key to use the elevators and to get through the front doors after 11pm. It was a more secure feeling.Breakfast was pretty good, loved the waffle maker!Also, free computer/printer access dedicated to printing boarding passes. Very handy!Free room wifi, and front desk called to make sure we were happy with our room a couple hours after we checked in. The door attendant was helpful too.. holding our bags in a closet while we went to a museum.. and hailing a cab in the rain for us.Price was good too. Highly recommended!",2
3,"I had dinner about a week or so with a few colleagues. Going to any steakhouse, you have to expect to drop a good bit of money. I got the porterhouse, and it was cooked perfectly at medium temperature. This gets a 3 star - only relative to the other steakhouses in Philly. Philly is all about restaurants with personality and Morton's just lacks that, though I know this is a chain. Morton's should consider restyling their layout. When we got there, it was just a huge empty room with a bunch of tables. There were probably 4 tables full max, which makes the restaurant look empty and somewhat undesirable. All in all, you will get a good steak here, but for the price you're paying, you could get a good steak AND better ambiance elsewhere.",1
5,Noting in Central Jersey can compare to the bagels coming out of Rolings. Real NY style that is hard to find even in NY these days.  Luck me that my in-laws live a few blocks away.  Come early and get them hot.  No two look the same.,2
3,"I have a few issues with this place regarding the quality of food for the high price. I would/should be giving it 2 stars based on the food alone, however, the service was so good to warrant a full star on that alone- & I evaluate a place based not only on the food but on the entire experience.So, the food: if you have it on the menu, you better have it in the kitchen. They were missing a few things which was very disapponting. We shared the scallops which were the best part of the meal- but for $3.33/scallop it better be good. I settled for the salman which was nothing special (salmon is usually a fail safe for me, I always get it if nothing else jumps out at me on the menu- so I've had a lot of salmon throughtout my life.) It was accompanied by heavily peppered carrots & green beans and a ""root puree"" which was just a fancy way of saying mashed potatoes.... which was a tease because I was expecting sweet potato, parsnips or SOMETHING better than a root vegetable I am already fully aware of. Drinks were decent: my bf had a bourbon/cherry martini & I had my favorite- a dry, dirty grey goose martini. Hard to mess those up , though. Desserts were a puffed pastry that lacked any real flavor & a coconut creme brulee that was actually quite good- but just like a baked potato- is pretty hard to mess up. Like I said before- the one waitress that was manning the entire floor & bar did an exceptional job. She was friendly, thorough & attentive- she deserves a shout out.",1
1,"I stopped going this BK and usually avoid all BK. I don't know if all BK are like this one or is this location uniquely bad. Whenever you pass by you never see many cars so you get tricked into thinking that you could get in and out fast. When they do answer to take your order, its never friendly or welcoming. Once i thought i heard someone say ""Yea, what u want"" but i will give the benefit of the doubt i miss heard. Nothing i order is complicated or special request so you would think it wouldn't take long. It seems as if they don't start until you have paid, because they ask for me to pull around. I understand if they were busy or off hours or something reasonable, but no. You can hear them holding conversations, that if were management they would be fired on the spot. You get a sense of not being welcomed as if your inconveniencing them. Then after waiting, they bring your order to your car and say nothing. No sorry for the wait, or bla bla.I have learned the hard way to not leave until you check your food to make sure its 100%. 9 out of 10 times my order is wrong in some way. Either something is missing or they ignored my request all together. You then decide is it worth the possible wait time and rude service or just take it and leave. The last time i left i swore to never go back.If someone from management reads this, if you want to know why your store is dying. Look at your employees first, then quality control.",0
4,"Came here to fill a Mexican food craving and boy did they fill it. Although we went later in the evening, the chips and Salas's came out fresh, chips still warm. The waitress was patient while we reviewed their large menu. Ended up getting chicken and shrimp fajita and a beef enchilada of some kind. Show them the picture and they'll know which one I am talking about. The chicken and shrimp fajita was super good. The shrimp were large and delicious. The enchilada thing was also delicious. Just enough cheese on top to satisfy you!",2

5,"I may be jumping the gun by giving 5 stars for a drink, but I have to. I have been to NOLA many times and I can't believe I have never stumbled in to the bar at Muriel's.  This was my lucky day. I met a group of friends at the bar for my first taste of the sweet nectar of life called brandy milk punch.  How did I not know about this before?When in NOLA, do yourself a favor and get one. Or three.  The next time I am in the city I will definitely stop by for a meal and update my review.",2

5,"It was our last night in NOLA and I made dinner reservations for 7:30 pm. I was impressed with the decor and design of the interior which use to be a church many years ago. The building had it's 100th birthday in March and is located  Mid City in the midst of cemeteries, funeral homes and some residential.Our waiter Gregory N who formerly worked for a well known restaurant in town was humorous, professional and a native of NOLA. We started off with a bottle of Merlot and ordered the smoked deep fried soft shell crab and a cup of seafood gumbo. When the soft shell arrived I was taken back how large it was and tasted divine. The gumbo was also yummy and contained generous amounts of seafood.For dinner I selected the Flounder, fried green tomato, and stuffed mirliton. OMG this entree was so delish. The fish was superb and the stuffed mirliton which was my first time experiencing and was delish. I can honestly say I experienced authentic Cajun food at Redemption. I sampled the stuffed gulf shrimp with crab stuffing and the taste was also outstanding. We ended our magnificent meal with the Crepes with Louisiana strawberriesWhat's funny is how I stumbled onto Redemption's by dinning at their casual sister restaurant earlier in the week which is located in Prairieville - Tommy's Fish house. Christian who runs Tommy's recommended Redemption. We had the pleasure to meet the owner of Redemption Marie and head chef Greg Picolo who were gracious to spend some time with us and make us feel welcomed. I must say that the seafood was the freshest quality and reasonably priced compared to several other high end restaurants we dined at NOLA.Redemption exceeded my expectations and I would definitely return here next time I'm in NOLA.",2
5,Food was pretty good. We had a long day and it was good to have delicious indo-chinese food.,2
5,"Just recently found this restaurant. Tastefully decorated, quick polite service. One of the best Chinese meals we've  ever had. If you do Chinese take out or eat in, don't miss this place. Quality all the way. The sushi is outstanding also .",2
4,"It was only my first time here. It was an okay experience. The scallops I had were a bit more salty than I expected though. Otherwise, the deals are great. I happen to have come here on a Friday where they had $2-$3 specials on drinks. This used to be Mangroves, but now under this new ownership, the scene is a lot more casual and beachy than before. I liked it for its laid-back environment. They offer you free bacon at your table the way most restaurants offer free bread!",2
4,"This was mine and my fiancé's first time eating here because it not only just opened up, but I got a coupon for a free pizza, so why not right?We weren't blown away with the experience or the pizza, but liked that it was fast and efficient. The staff that made that pizza was very friendly, but the cashier wasn't sharing that same enthusiasm. Wouldn't drive out of my way to go here, but if we are in the neighborhood and feel like some pizza, we may go back.",2
5,Our first time here thanks to Groupon and everything was A okay! All the employees were friendly and polite! The guys were really quick in diagnosing and repairing my husbands AC in his truck! I will be returning and recommending all my friends to this place! You guys were awesome!,2
5,"Great wings and atmosphere!! Gone quite a few times and have received consistently great service, beer, and food.",2
5,"If I could add a star, this one would get more. We set outside overlooking the gulch. Food was excellent, and service was excellent.A little on the expensive side, but well worth it.",2
5,"This restaurant could NOT get any more delicious!!!! We had a party of 4 and were able to walk in at 7pm on a Wednesday - but by about 7:30pm it was PACKED!  Our waitress was an absolute delight and she explained everything from cocktails to dessert so effectively, we were excited to start! We ordered IPAs and an imaginary friend which were both excellent and the perfect drinks to begin the meal.We ordered the 3 cheeses, all paired with their own jam.  The cheddar cheese with the apple butter is to die for.  We also ordered the bacon fat cornbread for an appetizer and let me tell you, this thing was simply delicious.  We basically licked the skilled clean.  We also all shared a beet salad and the roasted cauliflower - excellent even after the gluttonous cornbread!The main dishes we had were the pork with bacon fried rice, the pork steak and the burger.  Every single bite we took was followed by a ""MMMMMM!"" or a ""OMG how can all these taste this good!"".  I loved the flavor of the burger with the peppers and cheddar cheese and the french fries with homemade ketchup/mayonnaise and my husband could not stop eating the bacon fried rice! The dessert we got for a birthday at our table was the apple crumble with ginger ice cream.....holy delicious!!! The ginger ice cream is the star with delicious salty, sugary apple and crumbles!I am so happy to welcome Reeds to Maplewood! We will absolutely be returning and telling all of our foodie friends to check them out!",2
4,"This restaurant gets its name from the fresh olive bread they serve - which is wonderful! The menu is rooted in old world Mediterranean fare, but has a slight modern flair, too. The weather was wonderful, so even though the outside eating area overlooks the parking area, we opted to sit outside. The grape vines on the trellises were beautiful and healthy and just about to burst into fruit! Our entrees included the walnut encrusted trout, seafood linguine - clams, shrimp, white fish, mussels, over bed of linguine, and a lamb kofte special.  The trout was a healthy serving and perfectly prepared. Clams, mussels and shrimp over a bed of linguine was another healthy portion and half ended up in a to-go box! Again, delicious, attractively presented and perfectly prepared.  Lamb is a personal favorite, but if I had it to do over again, I would've opted for something else. It tasted ok (meat was a bit dry)  but less than appealing appearance-wise: looked like two crisscrossed sausages. It came with a very thin (runny) yogurt cucumber sauce - not the standard tzatziki one would expect. Entrees will run you about $22, pastas around $16-18, so it's not overly pricey, but the addition of a couple adult beverages or bottle of wine can change that in a heartbeat.All in all, it's a nice place with good food and attentive service. We all voted we would be back.",2
2,"A great place to stop by if you're about to buy beer next door.  More popular with the locals due to it's location, if you want really nice desserts try Isgro's Pastries, if you want inspirational pizza try Di Bruno Bros.  The pizza tastes okay and the baked goods are so-so.  If you like really slowly and carefully made home-style cookies, this is your place but don't get your hopes up.  Something was very off about their alleged ""Vietnamese Ice Coffee"" which actually made me physically ill after my first sip.  Maybe I am misinformed but I also thought Nutella was recently classified as a neurotoxin, in any case I wouldn't try their Nutella cookies unless you're aware of the side-effects.  The parfaits are stingy on fruits and over-priced and a lot of other items seem to be asking for too much price-wise given the low-quality and small amount served.  The mural on the outside is nice to look at and the whimsical nature of the inside makes it seem like it's more than it really is.  It's just an industrial bake shoppe that puts out thoroughly average products.  They do a lot inside the shoppe, so many workers behind the cashier making things but usually have many things unavailable yet they have a wide selection of other things to get like ""Hot Pockets"" and ""Ice Cream Sandwiches"" both of which are very unusual interpretations of the traditional items.  Thing is everything here tastes like imitation, since the store is named after a pet cat I suppose being a copy-cat is part of the business model.  Great food to get for your kids, in fact this place caters mostly to children.    If you want to experience listening to probably the most annoying and redundant Pandora stations feel free to stop in and bob your head to the old school jock jams, otherwise bring ear plugs.          All in all, it's kinda gross but you might be into that kind of thing.  It's Philly after all.",0
2,What the heck has happened to Claim Jumper?? The food used to be very good. My girlfriend and I went there for lunch and it was terrible! It used to be one of my favorite restaurants but the food is no longer worth eating. I can only assume they will be going out of business soon. Very sad.,0
5,Really nice  hair salon with caring and professional staffs. My husband and my son all come here for their hair cuts and color.   Best hair salon in the area.,2
4,"I enjoyed my stay here, despite the horrifically slow elevators. Come to think of it, I think only one (of three) was working!Now I know why people have weddings here-- I love the decor/look. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. Free internet and printing in the lobby (sure beats paying for it in your hotel room). Huge beds and a flat-screen TV make for a comfortable stay. Conveniently located within a mall, near the metro. Easy access to Einstein's Bagels, a bar, and the HardRock Cafe.",2
4,"Better than Hooters for both food and scenery.  The servers here are certainly friendlier.The food is okay, basically pub food.  The menu is small, but who comes to a restaurant like this looking for an expansive menu?We've been in a couple of times for lunch.  They usually are seating immediately.The biggest downside is the parking lot.  Some of those potholes could swallow a car.",2
3,"Silver in the City has some really nice jewelry.  They also have a lot of fun trinkets that would make good gifts--things like Better-Than-A-Boyfriend soap, snarky fridge magnets, and bacon flavored gum.  They also sell some locally made goods, such as purses made from the roof of the old RCA dome.  Somewhat surprisingly, they sell furniture as well.  The location is nice, right next to Starbucks on Mass Ave.The reason I give it 3 stars is that it seems really overpriced.  I'm not a jewelry expert, so I can't comment on those prices.  They may be quite legitimate.  A lot of the jewelry is really beautiful, and made by artists.  But all of the gifty items cost at least twice what I would have expected.  There may be a reason for this that I'm not aware of--I do know that some items are printed on recycled paper and reused materials.  I respect that.  But other items really seem unreasonable, like the $8 bar of soap or the $20 bento box.  As someone who has to live on a budget, this is a bit of a turn off.  But the place was full of people on a Sunday morning, so maybe I'm just getting old and cranky.  It is obviously a very popular store in Indianapolis.  To each their own, I guess!",1
5,"This place was exactly as advertised.  Showed up at about noon on a Saturday, the place was busy but we were able to grab the last two seats at the bar.  Village burger was incredible, so was all the whiskey we tried.  Highly recommend the Manhattan, one of the best I've had anywhere.",2
5,I absolutely love this restaurant.  Having been to many Indian restaurants in New England this was definetly a cut above.  Doing the tourist thing at Valley Forge and Philadelphia we came upon this restaurant by chance.  Our entrees were great and the Indian bread sampler was delicious.  We had enough left over for breakfast the next morning and had leftover bread for lunch that day.  We were so impressed we made a special trip back out to King of Prussia to eat again that night.  The owner of the restaurant was extremely nice and took a genuine interest in his customers.,2
3,"I tried a dog with bacon wrapped around it, all the toppings.  It was tasty.  Next time I think I'd like to try the bacon dog without all the extra-stuff on top.  The restaurant has the feel of a college bar.  It's dark with loud music video's playing on several TV's hung from the ceiling.  The staff was friendly.  The flan was superb but needed more sauce.  The parking lot is smallish and a little hard to turn into if someone is on the way out at the same time.  The handicapped parking spots are poorly positioned and should be moved closer to the entrance.",1
4,"MIMOSAS!I've had brunch here twice and I love it! Yes, I love mimosas! I've had blood orange and orange. My first time there I had their Eggs Benedict Lorraine and it was tasty. Second time, I had their Slate Stuffed Burger with truffle fries. I love truffle fries! The burger was big and juicy... I was stuffed!Their food is so good, inexpensive and the service is great! The seating inside is pretty dark but there are 2 tables outside and seats by the window. Whenever I was here for brunch, there was never a wait and not that many guests. Parking is street but easy to find if you're there for Sunday brunch. Just be mindful of the meters and time limits!",2
2,"So lets just start with the good stuff: classy environment, great company, extremely friendly staff (from bouncers to bartenders), and coat check was pretty cheap.However, they do a lot of false advertising! We paid $100+ for tickets that included complementary champagne toast, open PREMIUM bar, and food.1) There was no champagne toast2) They missed the countdown (like ... how?)3) There was no premium liquor being used, and every drink tasted like soda (unless you tipped the bartender every time, and we noticed one telling the other not to use so much liquor but she said we tipped so its fine... lol)4) There was no food whatsoever.",0
2,"SHARKS!  Buyer beware.  I got 2K on my trade in and I was willing to put 3000 down as my down payment on a BASIC, No FRILS model car priced at 20K. Wanted to get my monthly payments around $320 at most.They had little to no wiggle room, and weren't able to work with me on anything.  In fact they kept coming back to me with 4% and 5% interest rates and monthly payments of $412? and $386? a month, even though my credit rating is very good. They told me I wasn't going to get a better deal anywhere. They smiled and lied through their teeth the whole time. They kept reiterating that they barely make any money off of selling cars, as if I was supposed to feel sorry for them? but what about all the incentives they receive at the end of the year for pushing volume!?  I left. Two days later I went to Mainline Honda and they got me what i wanted at price I wanted at .9% rate. I don""t work for Mainline Honda. I'm not friends with anyone at Mainline Honda. I just wanted people to know there is a major difference between the two dealers. Conicelli will not respect your needs as a customer.",0
5,Great pizza! Amazing salads! Quick and friendly service at any of their locations! I highly recommend their chopped salad!,2
5,"Delicious! I had a burger and my wife got the eggs with short ribs, both of which we loved. For dessert we had an orange float, which we also quite enjoyed. The service was excellent, and the food was really quite cheap. Definitely worth a visit!",2
2,Three from my office had lunch delivered from San Antonio Taco today.  It was our first time from there.  The food did not live up to the reviews.  Three of us ordered sides of refried beans and rice.  All 3 thought the beans were much too salty and the rice was clumpy.  I had beef enchiladas.  The beef was cut with the grain instead if against it so it was stringy and inedible.  I will generally give a restaurant a second try but not sure I will this time.,0
4,Great little spot for having done local beers. It's a bit small. Not some place I'd go extremely often but good to mark off the list. Nothing super unique but they know what they are and they do it well. Very nice staff.,2
5,"Popped in for dinner after our ""Mall Santa"" experience and we were not disappointed. Hubby ordered the Ciopinno, I ordered the steamers and we got a Margarita Pizza for the tiny human. Ciopinno and Steamers were spot on! The pizza was good, but they do serve it on a different type of crust (I apologize for not knowing, but I was not concerned with the crust when ordering) that I was not used to, but mini me didn't mind one bit. You could tell the ingredients were fresh and as we ate the place continued to fill up.    Our server was a very pleasant man with a sense of humor we understood. Charlotte, the other server who came on the floor about mid way through our meal, was absolutely amazing! She might have a great thing for little humans, and that's ok with us. Charlotte cartered to our little peanut and made her (and us) feel special.   We shall return again soon M3. We'll done.",2
5,"Dave was very nice and explained the menu, the dogs were whipped up fast and were delicious, hit the spot. Dave's special, pizza dog and a custom creation were all excellent and he threw in some grilled jalapeños too. Santa Barbara desperately needs more late night food carts like this.",2
5,"I cannot say enough how much I loved this place!! It has a great old school diner vibe. The workers there were so so nice. I had never had gumbo and they make it to order but they made us 2 little tasters, and I usually don't even like shrimp but I ate every last bite!!! We also had the grits, fried chicken and the split pea soup was the best freaking split pea soup I have ever had in my life and I am not kidding. And the prices are insanely affordable, between the 2 of us we ordered a lot of food and beers for only $25. Great deal!",2
5,"I ate here with a work group, table of seven, and it was beyond fabulous. From service to apps to mains to desserts. The only thing wrong was stomach size!!! We had two very attentive servers. All of our orders were recommended. We ordered three different shareable apps for the table and I honestly can't recall which three because they were gobbled up. One guy ordered shrimp and grits, I ordered the diver sea scallop app, and the others all ordered barbecue shrimp. My scallops practically melted off my fork. Devine! We all got a spoonful of grits which were beyond fab. And I ate at least 1/3 of my neighbor's shrimp. We had to get extra bread to sop up the goodness left over.  Ordered three absolutely fabulous desserts to share as well. I mean I'm glad I had a small plate so I could help others clean theirs!!! When in NOLA, do it in style.",2
1,"Gaetano's used to be one of the better spots in the area (not saying much) to grab a good quick lunch. I'd stop in here roughly once a week to grab a sandwich off of their lunch special menu that rotated daily.Well they completely ruined that. Gone is the rotating, reasonably priced lunch menu. They've since replaced it with a menu that isn't even worth ordering off of. They regularly had specials of sandwiches, wraps, and salads on the lunch menu for under $7 that came with chips/fries and a drink. All but one item on the menu includes a drink now and I just paid $9.01 for a buffalo chicken wrap, tiny bag of chips, and soda I had to buy separately. Whoever made it must have missed the memo on how to assemble it because it didn't have the crisp lettuce and tomato inside of mine that was stated on the menu. I got a $9 wheat wrap stuffed with a pathetic amount of chicken and nothing else. It was smaller than the premade Wawa wraps. Huge change in what Gaetano's used to be, their portion sizes were always their strong point.I posted a picture a while ago of a meatball sandwich lunch special I got before they started cheaping out on their offerings. I wish I took a picture of my pathetic wrap today, they couldn't look more different. I didn't have time however because it took about 12 minutes to come out and some of us don't have all day.I'll be looking elsewhere during my lunch break.",0
1,"Horrible experience all the way around. 3 hostesses standing around looking bored, told us 10 min or less to seat us, then 30 some odd minutes later ( because my husband complained there were numerous tables empty and we were the only people at the time waiting) we were seated and treated as if it were a chore for one of them to seat us, talk about being unwelcomed. We also asked about a table for 6 that was empty, as there were 5 of us, and were told that this table was reserved. When I pointed out that I had called prior the day before and was told that there are no reservations, the hostess just starred at me blankly. Once seated, there was a mix up with the wait staff regarding which waiter was to serve us, no big deal. We ordered drinks, an appetizer, and dinner as soon as that was ironed out, and the waiter was pleasant and apologetic. We asked for bread and got it, drinks came soon and we were off to a better start until 30 min later they brought out clams when we ordered raw oysters, when we explained to the food runner that we didn't order clams, he said that they ran out of oysters and clams was all they had. This was an odd explanation, and we sent the clams back of course. My daughter's Caesar salad was overdressed and had large bits of anchovy, so she didn't eat much of it. After waiting for over an hour for dinner (after we had ordered), my grilled shrimp, and rice on the plate arrived to the table cold and half of the shrimp were burnt. I was hungry and tired, it was late, so I just ate the shrimp and rice. The waiter was apologetic for the wait and seemed to be trying very hard. There were two tables that needed to be cleared nearby almost the entire 2 1/2 hours we were sitting there with food all over the floor, it was disgusting. I thought to myself that one of the 3 hostesses should have stepped in to help instead of standing around an empty lobby with a sour look on their faces. It's apparently a training issue for the staff and the kitchen. Everyone else's meal was served warm or hot, so mine must have been prepared an hour or so before everyone else's. My daughter's crab cakes had so much red bell pepper, it was almost as if it was red bell pepper she ordered with a garnish of crab. So, she ate 2 bites and came home hungry. My mom was promised her own small birthday cake (since we were there to celebrate her birthday), but that never arrived, and neither did the manager. We ordered dessert since it was her birthday, but I have to say that the key lime pie was so sour most of us couldn't eat more than just the one bite. Bonefish is so much better, as well as the Shrimp Boat. Brandon could really use another good Seafood restaurant however, but this is not one of them. I can understand that in 6 months or so, they will have their routine down and the staff will be trained with all of the kinks out, but for the high price and low quality of the food we won't be coming back. I have to say that if the food was good, we'd give it another try, but it just wasn't.",0
5,"Went here for Valentines Day with my boyfriend and we both loved it. The food was great and the wait staff were wonderful. I had never eaten Indian before (unlike my boyfriend) but our waiter was very helpful and even got me a more mild Chicken Tikka Masala and helped my boyfriend out with his order. Both were very delicious. The waiter even gave us some fresh nan on the house which was also very good. Overall I think this place needs more recognition, it seemed very un-busy for a Saturday holiday. Will definitely go again, 5 stars.",2
5,"After searching for the best beignets in New Orleans, we finally found it at Morning Call.   The beignets were absolute perfection.  Flaky, poofy and beautifully golden brown.  We asked our waitress what was special about theirs and she said that it's the sourdough in the dough.  She also said that they had just changed their frying oil which made them extra delicious, I'm sure. And my husband said the cafe au lait was to die for as well. Please don't waste your time going to the other beignet places unless what you really want is a crispy fried funnel cake (no lie!). Stop by Morning Call on your way in or out of New Orleans and you won't be disappointed.  Open 24/7.",2
5,"We had the house specialty fish tacos made with Atlantic Mahi Mahi and a side of black beans. Since this was my first time eating fish tacos, I've nothing to compare them to. They were really good, but I think I liked the side of black beans better! The service was great. Clean establishment.",2
4,"We were shopping in Indianapolis on recent trip and craving something sweet. We saw The Flying Cupcake and stopped by on the way back from the mall. It was around 6 or 7 on a Saturday afternoon and there was not many cupcakes left choose from. I think they had wedding cake cupcake, lemon, blueberry, raspberry and birthday cake cupcake but only about four of each. I saw the lemon filled lemon cupcake and went for that. My girlfriend got the blueberry cream cheese cupcake. When we got out to the car I took one bite of this cupcake and my taste buds exploded, it was so good. I hadn't had dinner yet so I vowed to eat the rest after dinner. I couldn't stop eating this cupcake. It was gone before we even got over to Chick-Fil-A for dinner. My girlfriend was driving so she couldn't shove her face quite as quick as I could, but she had half of hers gone by the time we got over to Chick-Fil-A. She was a good girl and saved the other half of hers for after dinner. If I'm ever in the area again I'll trying stopping by earlier in the day. The man working the counter said they had a bigger selection in the morning.",2
4,"There are a ton of good sushi places in Reno and I have tried them all, but it always seems like Rickshaw has the freshest fish. I'm not a big fan of rolls and sauces, and opt mainly for Nigiri or sashimi. You can get some dressed up roll anywhere, hell you can buy them in the store, but if you are a true fan of sushi, just fish is where its at and Rickshaw has some of the freshest in town.",2
5,"BEST Indian food I have ever had. Their tikka masala is crazy good. Very cute little place in kind of a sketchy location, but definitely worth it!!",2
1,"The absolute worst! Sat for 20 min's at the counter waiting for a tuna sandwich. Staff isn't friendly, place is old and dirty. It's insane how good this location could do if they got their act together. HORRIBLE.I miss Billy G's.",0
3,"I had high expectations when I went to this place recently after some recommendations from friends.  We visited on a night when there weren't very crowded so it was nice to be able to have such an attentive waitress and service.  I was a bit disappointed when I didn't find as much on the menu as I would have liked to have seen that would appeal to me.  I guess I have become very picky with my Yelp addiction in terms of scrutinizing every establishment I go to pretty thoroughly.  I ordered the hummus appetizer for the table and was very pleased at the quality of the dish.  For my entree I ordered their Bricks Salad which had plenty of fresh produce packed in.  I ordered a double portion of chicken for it, which still seemed pretty skimpy especially since I was charged for that request.  Overall, I'd say this is probably one of Ybor's lesser known spots as its more on the western edge of the main strip, yet it seems very lively and upbeat.  I did like that they had featured lots of artwork by various local artists that were on display and offerred for sale.  Not a bad place to hang out and have a drink if you're looking for a lower key outing in the Ybor area.",1
5,"Once again you arent coming here for anything but the food. It is a place most people will look at and drive by.However it is another hidden gem of epic proportions. They have a different way of making their food with a slight charred taste that is noticeable if you are any sort of regular at eating asian food.I recommend the shanghai noodles, the flat noodle and beef with black bean, shredded pork crunchy noodle, and a dumpling soup similar to a wonton soup. This is another place that you will not regret if you try it. They really shine at the fried noodle dishes, so try keep it close to that if possible. Also try milk tea if you never have before.",2
5,"Everything they say about this deli is true - best lunch in town.  Check out their website and you will get an idea of their extensive menu.  The lines are long at lunchtime, but move quickly.  Customer service is the best in town - all nice people and smiling faces.  Unless you have a gnourmous appetite, get the 1/2 sandwich which is really a regular sandwich with less filling and it is more than enough including a side and pickles.  Only bad thing is my job moved from center city to the suburb and I miss the Coventry Deli - always am sure to stop in when I'm occasionally in town.  This is a don't miss place - you won't be sorry.  As for recommending what to order - everything they serve is great!",2
3,"Walking down Chestnut street, this place is easy to pass by so- just don't. Go on in (if there's a place to sit) and find a cute upholstered chair or spot on an old leather chair, or snag a spot on a vintage velvet seat next to the window.  Share a couch or sit at the bar and enjoy all that Tippling has to offer. Overall, I like and enjoy this place, like the decor, like the drinks and like the bartenders. However, the cocktail list can get a bit pricey.  Two drinks for $34.00? What did we order? The menu is quite fancy and there are a lot of offerings.  I only threw back one egg white whiskey sour (which was delightful) so I need to be sure to come back to check out the rest of the spirits. Service took a bit of time, which was odd, since when I was here it wasn't crowded. The speakeasy feel is a bit overthrown by the open windows, well lit space and open floor plan but this isn't the 1920's/1930's- prohibition era has ended at last!  Comfortable and perfect for a smaller group.  Overall, decent place but nothing that left a lasting impression on me",1
5,"Great tour offering a lot of facts about importing our table sugar, salt, coal, etc. Saw many goats used in shrimping and fishing. Enjoyed every bit of this steam boat tour! I didn't see the other steam boat until the next day and so glad we booked a tour for this steam boat. This boat offers great seats and great views. The other boat looked more like a tourist boat with benches lined up. The oh not so comfortable feeling. Steam boat Natchez is the way to go!",2
3,Great ribs-chicken-pork.  Corn was dish was excellent.  Praline cheesecake was not what I expected but fit the bill.  Great atmosphere.  Best seats are in the window where you can watch the street cars go by.,1
5,"The food was amazing and the service was great.  We went early on a Saturday night and it was already busy.  We had the guacamole and the spicy beets as appetizers.  The guacamole was pleasantly spicy.  I personally had the salmon and while it was good, the vegetable flan side was the best part of the dish.  My husband had a seafood dish that was great, and one of my sons had the empanadas which were very flavorful and the pastry was light and flaky.  It started to get a bit noisy, so it's not the best place to hold a conversation, but the decor is very trendy and does not match the outside at all.  We all agreed we would be coming back again!",2
2,"I really wanted to give these people the benefit of the doubt. The grooming cut has always been so cute (only reason for 2 stars), but I just can't deal with their stupidity. I've been taking my dogs, Cleo and Chloe, for over a year and every single time I go it's PAINFUL checking them in. They spell Chloe, Chole. I've reminded them for the last year to please change it because every time I set up an appointment it confuses them. They had my phone number is backwards also. I've asked them EVERY visit to correct this, not just at the grant and swan location either. I went in today for Chloe's 4 week cut and now she's not even in their system. It's like a bunch of brainless high school drop outs are running the place. Won't return for my own sanity.",0
4,"Just a regular Panera Bread but not quite as comfortable as some others I've been to. I love their pasties, bagels, and their Thai salad.",2
4,"A short jaunt from the transit center, this place is a really convenient stop on the way home from work/school. Yummy, cheesy, meaty tacos, and they're CHEAP! They also have tortas, liquados, AND vegetarian options. It's also a really cute, warm atmosphere. Tacos al pastor is a winner (love the added fresh pineapple!), so are their potato tacos (a lot of places don't seem to make these, but so glad these guys do!) The place is small and can get really crowded around lunchtime, but it's also a very nice and warmly decorated dining room for a little taco place. I'd go here over Lily's any day.",2
5,"When my glasses broke, these folks were incredibly helpful.  They worked to get my prescription from my doctor in California.  They called me to let me know what was happening.  They told me about cheaper options.  They were friendly.  Can't say enough good things about them.",2
2,"Average food with a really good location. I went for breakfast once and lunch another time. Breakfast was average, same with lunch, which was a choice because the first two places we picked were closed for lunch hours. For the lunch visit, we split a patty melt and a corned beef sandwich. The menu made it sound like the corned beef was a hot open faced sandwich, but it was nothing more than cold lunchmeat and dressing. Everything was bland and under seasoned. Wait staff hung out by the counter a lot to talk, but seemed friendly when they approached our table. Food wasn't 'bad', but the only reason I'd really go back is because of the location and if I was in a hurry, no other reason to really go back, and I live in the immediate area.",0
4,"Had my first taste of Rolling Feast's Southwest-inspired fare (using local ingredients) at a bank promotion. Surprisingly prompt service. Super-savory flavors in a Vegetarian Enchilada loaded with black beans, corn, eggplant, squash, tomatoes, and topped with fresh pico de gallo. Bursting with flavor but almost too heavy a meal for lunch. Also tasted the Quesadilla made with Goat Cheese, Mozzarella, Prosciutto, lightly toasted and served with a sour cream-based sauce on the side. Would love to try some of their other creations (seen other website)...but today was a limited offering. The locally sourced fresh veggies and made-in-truck rolls and dishes are just what a lot of us foodies are looking for. (Surprising that I haven't seen any other reviews of this truck--especially since they've been open since 2013.) In any event...check them out via twitter or Nashville Food Truck App.",2
1,"Been to this location twice and will never go back again!!!!First time was mediocre, the second time was so very disappointing it beggars belief. I ordered some ribs and had to send them back because one half was warm and the other half was refrigerator cold. They came back and one side was really hot and the other side was still cold, third time it was edible. The manager came over the third time to apologize, never once offered to comp anything. I'm not the kind of guy to cause a fuss to get something comped, but to send something back three times to get it cooked properly and only get an insincere apology really pisses me off, enough for me to write this review.",0
5,"Yum and yum.   What a cute place w great food!  Have been twice and will be back again soon.   The burger, the crème brûlée pork belly special, are two instant faves.   I almost don't want people to know about this place so it doesn't get over crowded!",2
5,"Nice little place in Carp with vegan and vegetarian options. Self serve salad bar with fresh local organic produce. The soup is usually vegan. The butternut squash is my favorite so far. They also have vegan options for their salads on the menu, as well as a quinoa bowl. Everything I've tried so far has been fresh and tasty. You order at the counter and they bring it out to you. They have lots of desserts but not too sure if any of them are vegan.",2
4,"Did you know canned goods here are often cheaper than in chain grocery stores in Edmonton? I like to buy Amy's products because their can linings do not contain BPE and all the other toxic stuff, and the prices here are less than the chain store ON SALE!!The deli regularly serves gluten free options for lunch!Organic produce - no, it might not be local, but it's usually affordable.  Organic mandarins! I got a case for a great price - they were ripe and ready to eat.  Not like the ones from the chain store that are a real hit or miss.It is a smaller location than the main store on Whyte Ave, but I generally find pretty much everything I shop for here - dishwasher detergent pucks, gluten free flour, heck I even got a straw cleaning brush!  If you can't find something (or in a hurry like me) staff can point you to where you should find it. Sometimes I come between shipments and they're out of stock, but it's never something so critical I can't come back another time.Bring your own bag - it's the best thing to do.  They can provide you with a bag if you really want one.Bicycle parking - yes, yes there is!  Street parking... well, it can be hit or miss depending if you have to pay because of the Arena events.  Check the meter before you walk away - it will tell you if you need to pay.  It's tough enough in the core, and unfortunate that the city can't give them a couple of free 15 minute express stopping spots during event nights.Oh, and free wifi - ask the staff for the password.",2
1,"Sorry, I have to say this is the poorest excuse of a restaurant ever.  What is up with the girls wearing stockings under those shorts.  That's nasty.  And do you guys really like when they sit next to you and act like they want to talk.  Oh yeah, I forgot it's every girls dream to sit at a table of fat, chicken wing grease covered, over 40, balding, married guys who may or may not have a pot to piss in.  But you're the same dude that goes to a strip club and thinks the stripper really likes you (dumb ass!!).  This is a joke of a theme restaurant and I am embarrassed to be a human when I see them do that hula hoop act in the middle of the bar.  I've been to Hooters twice and I don't plan on ever going again.  I guess it's okay if you just want some beer and wings but aren't there plenty of local bars that do that part better and with more dignity?  Even strip bars have more dignity.  But like Grandma used to say, ""...there's an ass for every seat"".  Grandma was always right.",0
1,"I normally LOVE Bailey's Range, but tonight was extremely disappointing. Our server seemed really nice at first to our table of four, but as the night went on, we saw her paying more attention to the table of four behind us. She was attentive to them, and checking in on them regularly. At one point we were out of water. Someone else had stopped to bring us more water. We had to flag down our server to get another drink for my friend, but she left so quickly after that, that we were not able to order for the rest of the table. While we waited, we noticed the table on the other side of us got all of their food...they were seated about 20 minutes after us. Our server could not be found for awhile, so my friend got the attention of another worker to see if she could check in on our order...this was over an hour after we were seated. We were seated at 7:33, but did not get our food until 8:45. She did not ask if we needed anything else. Our server never checked in and asked us how our food was. She never apologized that it was busy and that our food took so long. She did ask the four guys behind us many times, and I even heard her say they were getting 16 oz beers for the price of a 9 oz. Wow...how did they get that deal? One of my friends was getting tired, so we decided to ask for the check shortly after we ate our burgers. Our server flew right past our table to the table behind us to ask if they needed anything, then she started to walk away. My friend yelled her name 3 times to get her to come back so we could ask for the check. Still no apologies, no asking how our food or experience was. Personally, I was ready to walk out. But my friends were kind and still left a tip and did not make a ruckus. I completely understand that you folks were slammed with the Halloween convention in town, but it's no excuse for poor customer service, especially to those that live downtown and frequent your restaurant and recommend it to others. It's going to take me a long time to go back, if I ever do. I certainly will not be recommending it anytime soon. Sad and disappointed on many levels.",0
4,"Beautiful desserts, and a beautiful atmosphere. I love the rushing of the tourists and the beautiful lighting in the bakery.   The desserts are the kind that make children press their noses to the glass. I had my first cannoli here and loved it. You must try this place!",2
2,"Plain, bland, not good sushi restaurant.  3-4 younger Chinese boys were the sushi chefs.  None of the staff was friendly or concerned about my experience.  I had a dragon roll which was mushy, a spider roll which wasn't soft shell crab, and a spicy tuna roll that had a bunch of sesame seeds rolled into the rice.  Normally at a sushi restaurant I would order nigiri only but the fish in the hoshizaki refrigerator at the sushi bar looked unappetizing and not properly stored.Will not come here again. Stay away.",0
5,Adorable! Met a client here and she made me try the Fried Green Tomatoes.  I'd never had any before. They were DELICIOUS! So I came back with my kiddos to try their breakfast. Yummy down to the details - a frosty cold glass of cranberry juice.,2
4,"Good hoagies, which I have never been disapointed with.  It is always busy when I try them and they are very efficient in how the operation works and keep the wait short.  I have tried other locations as well and for a franchise, the standards are met across the board.",2
4,"We tried this place for the first time last night. Being a Saturday night during March Madness the service was a bit slow. The complimentary chips took longer to get to the table than my husband's salad did. Thankfully they had one of the nearby televisions playing a kid's movie to keep my 3 year old happy. Back to the chips, they are home made and were fantastic. I went the safe route and ordered a burger with seasoned fries. It was wonderful. My husband ordered the blackened chicken and while it was good it was a little over seasoned making it a tad too spicy. My daughter had the kid's macaroni and cheese. It looked wonderful but she couldn't stop eating the chips, LoL. The seating inside was a bit weird. There is a table about 2ft from the door to the women's bathroom. Maybe I'm weird for thinking it's weird but I ended up waiting until I got home to go. They offer a 15% military discount which was great. Overall I'd definitely recommend this place. I would have given it 5 stars if the service had been a little better.",2
1,"I was excited to try this restaurant. I was in from Los Angeles visiting family and Yelp had such great things to say. Then I asked to use the restroom. I poked my head in the kitchen and asked the brothers where it was. The chef brother told me I was interrupting him and his brother and that the only place I was allowed to talk to my server was on the floor. I thought he was kidding and the server brother sent me to the restroom. I came back from the restroom and the chef brother stopped me as I passed the kitchen to tell me that I was never allowed to come near his kitchen and that I needed to get the hell out of his restaurant. I told him I would be happy to leave since he was obviously insane. The server brother came back to ask to the kitchen to investigate why the chef brother was yelling at a customer. As we left I heard the brothers going at it again. The service was terrible. Because the brothers were having a bad day it was literally impossible for our table to complete placing an order without our server walking away while someone was speaking. We waited at least 15 minutes to place an order while watching the brothers argue in the door to the kitchen. The food we got, bread and either whipped butter in a dish of oil, was revolting. Primarily because none of us could figure out if it was whipped butter or some sort of soft cheese. It's obvious this is not the first time there two have had these kinds of arguments in their restaurant with customers present based on how easily they engaged in their unprofessional behavior. It's also obvious by how the chef brother treated me that I am not the first customer he has blown up at for no reason. The relationship between these brothers and their inability to maintain professionalism is going to bring this restaurant down. You simply can't treat customers, or co-workers, the way they treat them.",0
5,"One day after a really long 2 hour class, I was incredibly hungry. I am not a big food truck eater and after walking by I decided, eh why not?  I figured I would order and go home. I ordered the Mexican Chicken Platter and headed to my car. The aroma of the of the warm food had me wanting just a small bite. I figured one small bite and go home and enjoy the rest. Well see, sometimes things do not go according to plan! I couldn't stop eating. One bite just wasn't enough! You see I was so incredibly hungry and this was so incredibly awesome. I finished eating most of the dish and the feel good relaxed chemicals in my brain started flowing.",2
3,Katie's is a neighborhood restaurant that has existed in one form or another for a few generation.  It's classic New Orleans fare with an Italian-American slant.  Great meatballs.  You'll see all types of classic New Orleans old people dinging before 8pm.   You won't be disappointed if your expectations aren't too high.,1
4,"Awesome brunch place. I think they must have put crack in their white trash hash. I'm still dreaming about it every now and then. I couldn't remember what I had. The white trash hash blew my mind and it's the only thing I remember. They also have 2-1 special drink during brunch. The only 2 things that prevent me from going there all the times, are my student loan and a long wait. We end up sitting at a bar.",2
5,"Just got in from my 1st visit to Oriental Pearl and I loved it ! I wanted to try the Pho but my mouth was watering after looking at the menu. They have so much to choose from ! To start off, we ordered Vietnamese spring rolls which were delicious ! Light and flaky, with a wonderful side sauce. I ordered Beef with crunchy noodles as my entree. So good ! The beef was tender, green pepper and onion were cooked so that they weren't too soggy. Just right. And the noodles were crisp with added flavor from the curry sauce. Wonderful !! My sister ordered the Triple Delight , with shrimp, scallops and chicken. And she loved it ! ( She doesn't like spicy food, either. But said this was perfect.  Not spicy hot. We couldn't finish our platters. But found room for ice cream with fried bananas.  Perfect end to a great meal. The service was great, too. Food arrived quickly and the waiter and the mgr stopped by to ask us how everything was. They offer additional sauces on the table. One I fell in love with was Plum sauce. It's kind of like a sweet soy sauce. OMG.. So good. And the Owner was nice enough to give me a container to take some home, too ! Add this to your list of places to go. It's casual and quiet.  Nice place to eat and relax. Will definitely be back !",2
5,"Best wings ever! On vacation in Tucson and had a recommendation to try the wings here. They are so good, I can't wait to go back. The sauces were unique and awesome.",2
3,"I cannot comment on the food as I had only a couple beers. I did have the white IPA and a red ale which were good but not blow me away. I might be spoiled having 2 friends who brew professionally but the beers were good, not outstanding. The location is kind of far from other stuff which normally wouldn't bother me but everything around is seriously industrial and scenery does make a better place. They do discount the beer $1 when a train comes by and maybe that's the best they can make of a meh location. Probably give it more like a 3.5 stars. It does say something that there was a loyal following at 4pm on a Sunday.",1
5,"We have used Reno Vulcanizing for several years now and will not take a vehicles to anyone else. Ken, Bruce and all the other staff I have dealt with are always honest, courteous and helpful.",2
4,"A lot of really cute stuff, though a lot of polyester. Bought a rayon summer dress that I love for $18 (all items, pants, shirts, dresses, are $18 & I didn't see a sale rack) which makes the place definitely worth a stop whenever I'm in the neighborhood. Small place, so hit or miss as all thrift stores are, but cute and well-curated.",2
5,"First off we got a jacuzzi suit (large jacuzzi seats 3) on a holiday weekend, with breakfast (not continental) the day before for 119, customer service was amazing. Right across the street from every shopping center you could want.  Rooms were clean and updated, they are very accommodating about late check out, very hospitable.  sure you can spend 250 to stay on the strip and have a smoke filled/Packed  hotel, but if you don't mind being a few miles out, this place is perfect,  cheap cab ride to the strip. Only take sparks cab, we took a few, not only are they 33% cheaper (on average) but they are far more personable and faster upon arrival.",2
3,"My first time to Let them eat cake.I myself love cakes anyway it's wasnt busy at all, the service I have ever experienced. Granted it was friendly service, after we ordered, it was a few minutes before our everything arrived which was cool. I went from hungry to moving past the pangs of wanting to eat.I must say my cake was good though. The cake we had were ordinary to be honest i  have had better period with a much shorter wait.But its not that bad for me to stay away completey.",1
2,"Eek.  I'm going to have to disagree with James on this one.  I just went to Limoncello for the first time this weekend and am at a loss as to why it's so popular.  Despite our reservations, we waited 20 minutes for a table.  Another group that showed up after us without reservations was offered an outside table -- not sure why this wasn't offered to us as an option?  I guess because it was cold out they just made an assumption that we wouldn't want it?Once inside (which was deafening!) they gave us two small slices of bruschetta.  I thought this was to make up for the wait, but maybe not, because we never got a basket of bread like all of the other tables.  The waitress took our order and disappeared until she came back with our food.  The prices here are *high*!  A basic plate of pasta (we're talking ravioli with marinara sauce) set me back $18.  I guess they can get away with charging so much because they're BYO, but still...and then, when said ravioli actually arrived, it was cold.  That hasn't happened to me in a restaurant in ages, but since I accurately guessed that our waitress wouldn't be back to the table anytime soon, I ate it anyway.  We did order dessert - key lime cheesecake - which was pretty good and saved this from being a one star review.One thing Limoncello is famous for is providing a complimentary shot of limoncello to each diner after the meal.  Nice touch, right?  Too bad they ran out of limoncello (their namesake item!!!) before we finished our meal.  I have to say that, unfortunately, I wasn't in the least bit surprised.  I won't be back.",0
4,"Had a wonderful time! Our guide was hilarious! Made the tour that much more pleasant. Just sad that we didnt' get too see any alligators :( We went in February for Mardi Gras, and apparently it's too cold, so alligators don't come out. Wish this was mentioned on the site before booking. But seeing the wild boars was fun, so still got to get a Nawlins experience.",2
2,"We gave this place a second try, at the request of a family member. We went to dinner on a Sunday night, as  a party of 6. This time the appetizers were all in stock, and the only thing they were out of was sweet potato fries - not a big deal. We ordered the charcuterie plate and the brussels sprouts for appetizers and they were both great. The only critique I had is that the charcuterie plate came with three cheeses, two meats, and only five small pieces of bread. We immediately asked for more bread, but didn't receive it until our group had eaten 95% of the platter.I was again disappointed in the dinner. Of the 6 entrees on the menu, four were seafood, one was lamb, and one was beef. Two of us ordered the exact same thing - the 6 ounce beef filet, done medium. One of us received medium, while I received well done. This is twice I've received well done when ordering medium. Another member of our party ordered the Depot burger, and didn't receive it until 20 minutes after the rest of our food was brought out, despite everyone ordering at the same time. We made it known that it was unacceptable for him to have to sit there for twenty minutes, while the rest of us had been served. We were finished with our meals by the time his food arrived. I don't know if this was an issue with the kitchen, or with our order not being put in correctly, but I will note that our server wrote nothing down. The only saving grace for this place is their bar, with their refreshing and delicious cocktails. Everyone was pleased with their selections, and multiple rounds were ordered. I wish the dining experience lived up to the bar experience, but I don't think we will be giving this place a third chance.",0
5,"This is an awesome addition to the dessert options in Nashville! I love ice cream in a cone, but this absolutely knocks that out of the park (pun intended being next to Centennial Park)Service: The person working was a sweet older lady that was very patient, and even let us try several flavors which was nice. Food: I had the Monster (blue dough with M&Ms and peanut butter chips) and the Red Velvet in a French vanilla cone with caramel. Talk about treating yourself....so rich, delicious, and heavy if im honest. Next time I will have to split two scoops in a cone as the portions are outrageously large (not a bad thing)Overall, this place is a huge treat for your significant other or your kids. I highly recommend trying NoBaked at least once!",2
5,"I've used Merrigans several times for work on both a 2012 RV and a vintage 1984 Dolphin. They aren't the best at always answering the phones or calling back but they are the best at fixing what's wrong at a fair price. Your patience will be rewarded with a quality repair at a fair price. It's an honest mom and pop shop that has an eclectic collection of parts for older RV's along with the know-how and experience to fix anything. Definitely the place in Tucson where you won't get ripped off for work on your RV. If you want it done right and still have money left in your travel fund, go to Merrigans. They also have a FREE 24 hr. dump station WITH water.",2
3,The service was a bit slow at first but improved once we ordered drinks. The food was excellent and there was a lot to choose from. It is very reasonably priced with large portions. Only major negative was the bathroom. The Bathrooms was disgusting! Which is never good at a Mexican restaurant.,1
5,"I love the atmosphere here, and the food is toothsome. All ingredients are incredibly fresh and the dishes are thoughtfully prepared. Their coffee is also excellent.",2

4,"Came here for my 21st birthday dinner with my family and had a great experience! The food and drinks were to die for, but they were extremely overpriced. Even though the quality of food was good, I still don't think it was worth what we paid for. I recommend getting the lobster mac and cheese as an appetizer, it was probably the best mac and cheese I've ever eaten. At the end of the meal, they gave us some small complimentary desserts, even though we ordered a bunch of desserts to top off our meal. Had a great time, but definitely overpriced.",2
3,"One of the best places on Washington Avenue to sit outside and relax.  A very relaxing atmosphere both inside and out, with service to match.  We enjoyed both outside for people watching and inside for the fireplace and black and white movies on the televisions.   One of the best features of Blondie's is that while the rest of the block is loud and raucous, Blondie's is a nice oasis away from all of this. Food and drink:Blondie's offers an above average list of wines by the glass, and some very nice beer selections.  I enjoyed several red wines, a cava, and a few glasses of beer over several recent visits.  They also offer a limited menu of smaller plates, charcuterie and the likes, from which I have not ordered.  Given their offerings, I'm sure these are quite nice.  Also a very nice feature is their $4 wine nights on Wednesdays, which is always a plus.We will definitely be back in the future...",1
5,"Slice of Life in New Port Richey:I'm in heaven! Real NY-style pizza!!! The thin crust is delicious; the sauce has that unique flavor I've been missing since moving to California; the topping choices are interesting and well prepared. Yesterday we went the slice route instead of ordering a whole pie because it gave us a chance to sample different pies. Ted really enjoyed the ""ranch"" slice and I thought the ""white"" cheese slice was delicious. We both love the everything pie We tried the meat-lovers but felt the pancetta made it a bit too salty. next up: the FlorentineWe love this place!!! Mario is a pizza master chef IMHO!!! Ted thought I didn't like pizza because I rarely order it. Now he knows why: growing up with real NY pizza like this spoils you for eating the junk other places serve!!!There are 3 pizza places with the same name but completely different owners and staff. When I read the negative reviews I can't believe they are at the same Slice of Life in New Port Richey off Embassy and Little Rd. This review is for the Slice of Life Pizza restaurant in the Winn-Dixie shopping center on Little Rd.",2
1,"I find it hard to believe there are so many people with such low standards when it comes to the Daily Bread.It is a ripoff of St. Louis Bread Co/Panera Bread, which in of itself I don't mind at all.  I have eaten multiple times at the Daily Bread and have yet to have an enjoyable experience.  The food is so-so at best.  Their sandwiches are basic and lack any real flavor.  I also tried the BBQ Chicken pizza and it was okay.  I certainly wouldn't steer anyone away from this place based on the food.  The food is basic and simple, not bad but also nothing great.My biggest qualm with the Daily Bread is the service.  The majority of the workers seem utterly uninterested in helping out.  There was a line of about 6 people and one person at the register.  There was no sense of urgency to help any of the customers in line.  We waited for a good 5-6 minutes to put an order in.  After receiving our cups to get our drinks we looked for a clean place to sit and eventually settled on a table top that was the least dirty of the tables available.  There were plenty of open spots but it just appeared as though there was lots of trash left behind.  Does anyone bus these tables?I anticipate that people are responsible for cleaning up after themselves, but it appeared as though the tables hadn't been effectively cleaned in a while.  There was also some trash on the floor that hadn't been addressed as well.The order number was called and the order was only halfway completed.  When we asked which sandwich was ours, we were basically ignored as the girl put up two more orders.   After another few minutes the rest of the order came up and we began to eat.  I tried both items and as I stated before, both were okay.  The problem is that the food was just unable to make up for the lack of organization, the slow speed at which we were served, or the cleanliness of the restaurant.After 3 attempts, I'm writing the Daily Bread off and won't return.  I'd rather go to St. Louis Bread Co, get the same level of food, but in a clean environment and a timely setting.",0
1,"Has anyone made the joke about panning Pan D'Olive yet? Because, wow, this place is super terrible. Our server was mostly absent and left us waiting for our check for over ten minutes after we'd given up on trying to eat the food. My partner's Pepsi glass came with bright pink lipstick on it, and when we pointed it out to a server the guy laughed and asked if he had tasted it, LITERALLY IF MY PARTNER HAD FELT THE LIPSTICK ON HIS MOUTH. He also apologized, but we were still charged for the Pepsi my partner didn't drink. But not for the bonus lipstick, so, yay? I ordered a vegetarian pasta dish that left a gross greasy film in my mouth but was otherwise tasteless. My partner got the pork chop and garlic mashed potatoes, both of which tasted more like burnt and neither of which tasted like garlic. The mashed potatoes were watery and the meat was a poor quality chop with a weird texture. We did love the salads and the olive bread.",0
5,"Favorite salon in Nashville. Even though I have moved a little further away, I still go back. I've had haircuts, color, perm, and eyebrow waxing at the salon and have never had a complaint. My favorite stylist is Michelle Stone, who always makes me feel beautiful and fashionable when I leave, while also being honest and helping me find styles that work with my hair and not against it.",2
1,"Incredibly unfriendly staff. The place a filthy disaster. Dirty dishes all over the place. Trash bags sitting out like someone attempted to change the trash. They were out of many things at the drink area (lids, napkins). Used the lack of a cook as an excuse for all their issues but positioned it as an inconvenience to them and not apologetic to customers at all.",0
5,"I've been practicing yoga for a while now and I still can't believe we have a Yoga Studio THIS amazing in Tucson.  So many things to love about Yoga Flow.  YF has a huge variety of led classes for moderate and advanced practitioners.  Keep in mind, they have classes that are appropriate for all levels, but I haven't found another studio that offers really challenging classes for people that have a daily practice. Also, we have a Mysore practice in Tucson and it's right here at Yoga Flow! Tucson is one of a handful of cities in the US lucky enough to have an instructor blessed to teach by Sri K Pattabhi Jois. I can say that I visited many studios when I first started doing yoga, but when I found Yoga Flow I stopped looking.",2

4,"We've been coming here since '07 & our favorite waitress Sandy is gone, however we still come. Our fav is the Chicago Oysters, try them! We've had alot of different things on the menu from the wings (delish) to fall off the bone ribs, to the grouper, to the garlic butter scallops (really yummy), whatever you order you won't be disappointed. The salad that comes with the dinner is so so, nothing great, but the veggies, baked potatoes, etc are really good. Very good beer & drink selection, try the banana daiquiri! It's a regular for us when here from Chicago!",2

Great quiet, clean place to catch a healthy bite to eat!!",2
5,"I don't get to eat Mexican very often and when I do I'm usually let down. After eating here, all I can say is WOW! The food was amazing. I had some sort of combo and it was a definite 5 stars. The restaurant it self is a 3. The booth and tables are a little old and it's not exactly spotless inside. Also extremely limited drink menu, they definitely need to get a liquor license. Again, 5 STAR FOOD!",2
4,"One of my favorite places to come to on a warm evening. The food is delicious, drinks are far from weak and the staff are some of the friendliest I've ever encountered. As I already said, I prefer sitting outside (good for people watching), however love sitting in the pub area as well. Looking forward to visiting again this summer!!",2
3,"The food was good and the staff was nice, but we arrives at the start of the breakfast rush and it took a long time to get food to the table.",1
4,I always am in favor of local businesses.  They have a big selection here and you get free popcorn.  Why go to the big boys and have to pay for popcorn when you can get it here for free?,2
4,"I heard of this place and meant to try it for a long time, but was too poor to go. But then I heard they have half-price (select) sushi on weekdays! So of course we had to go try it out. The only thing I'd complain about is that the wait for the sushi bar is really long. You can't sit at the Teppan Yaki tables if you're only getting sushi and the sushi bar seats only a couple of people. The sushi was pretty good, although some rolls could have been made better. They were obviously in a rush since they had so many customers and so the service wasn't that great. But for $19 (not including tax + gratuity) we got 4 rolls and 4 pieces of nigiri. Overall pretty good for my sushi cravings when I'm on a tight budget.",2
5,"In the last month I have taken both our vehicles to the Jiffy Lube on Los Altos in Sparks,NV. Both times I was met promptly at my vehicle by a friendly employee!

3,"A pho place that checks all the boxes but doesnt have the best of anything.  We went to Lily's the day before, so I guess this review is a compare and contrast.  Decor is simple, white wall with 7 frames of challenge winners and 2 laggy TVs.  The service is fine, not as personal, but nothing really to complain.  The food was the biggest difference between the places.  The pho was plain, no complexity, almost like it came from a dry seasoning pack.  They also recommended the chicken vermicelli as one of their best -- it wasn't.  First off, they call it vermicelli but they used pho noodle instead?  What!!?? It was thick, heavy, and full the stomach quick --- everything a vermicelli not suppose to be.  Anyway, we left unsatisfied.",1
5,"Say you decide that you need a new door...and you only have $35.  Where do you go?  the Green Project. Or you have a bunch of left over building supplies, random bits of lumber, some roofing materials, maybe even some paint?  Where can you bring it so it doesn't end up in a landfill?  Again, the Green Project.",2
5,"Taking over in the spot of the original Benton Park  Cafe is Cafe Piazza.  The atmosphere is really nice and super ST. LOUIS.  The mural on the ceiling is a very eclectic work of art. Ask them how they did it and look under the bar. Great food. Different from your standard breakfast food.  Kinda fancy, but not intimidating.  I would highly recommend this restaurant for three reasons: decor, location, and good, creative food for the price.",2
2,No dark beer in February???  Nice looking place and nice folks...  summer beer in February was a disappointment...,0
3,"Never had a chance to come here for the fabled lunch buffet, I've eaten here several times but only for dinner.First, it seems as if their seating policy revolves not around how long you've been there, but instead how many hot chicks you have with you and how much they have been drinking at the front bar.  Good thing I always travel in the company of attractive inebriated females.When you finally get in, they have a HUGE menu with a really overwhelming amount of menu options.  Their sushi has been various degrees of quality and freshness, nothing fantastic or terrible.  I have enjoyed their noodle soup bowls, but with that as well as most of their other menu options, the portion sizes are grotesquely large.Ultimately, you will never have a great sushi experience in Nashville or really any place that is not right next to the coast.  If you think that you are, you live a sad, sheltered life.  I highly encourage you to travel to the West Coast, Hawaii or Japan and see what you've been missing.",1
5,"Review for HOTEL onlyStayed here on a stop over on the way to Vegas. It's right off the I-80 east but not close enough to hear any freeway noise. The room was clean, quiet and everything worked. Hot water, water pressure, A/C and heat worked. The bed was comfortable. I was on the 3rd floor and couldn't hear my neighbors through the wall at all. The only noise came from under the door, standard for most hotels I suppose, but nothing too bad. The quality of the stay in terms of the price is unbeatable. The room was $47 on a Sunday night. I'm sure it might be slightly higher for the weekend. The room is dated in terms of furniture but if that is not a big deal(which it isn't for me) then the stay is well worth the price. Included are some photos and there was some patchwork in the shower but again, I don't think that's a big deal.I will stay here again",2
3,"Slow...not as amazing the last few times I have been.  The tomatoes are still excellent, the fruit still the same, and the ideas still fresh.  But sometimes there are a stale lettuce pieces in the salad, and it can be like sit-down-and-read-a-book times. Still a great choice, but I think the sheer traffic from the groupon or whatever with one or two staff only can lead me to not be quite as delighted as before.  Still good as a local coffee place.",1
4,A little pricey.  But very good.  The food is pretty spicy.   I would suggest the dan dan and the fish casserole.,2
4,"I was introduced to Yats down in Bloomington,IN while I was an undergrad at IU and I was psyched to see they had locations in Indianapolis once I moved up here.  They serve traditional creole/cajun food over rice with the most delicious buttery bread.  Some of my favorite options they have on a regular basis are the chili-cheese crawfish etouffe, white bean chicken chili, the jumbalaya, and the red beans with sausage and rice.  Make sure you order extra bread as it is absolutely to die for.One of the quirky aspects to this place is that they are a cash only business, and there is no ATM within walking site, making it kind of difficult for first timers who dont know the routine.  The best part about the whole thing is that they take IOU's!!! No joke, like dumb & dumber style, written on a piece of paper, IOU's.  Its hillarious when they offer it to you for the first time, i didnt believe them at first but sure enough they write your name down and just ask you to pay next time.  Its great for those times you dont have any cash in your pocket as a college student but you know you can hit them up next time.",2
5,Needed a new set of catalytic converters on an older vehicle-- these guys hooked it up at a great price.,2
5,"Hands down one of the best dining experiences ever, and this was with 10 people. Great pompano, great salad, great cocktails, great service.  The Pompano Broussards was seriously one of the best pieces of fish I've ever had, seasoned well, a light - not overpowering - sauce, flaky and not over done.  Outstanding service, beautifully appointed dining room.  What I expected dining in the French Quarter to be like.GO HERE.",2
1,"DONT EAT HERE EVER!!!!  First, Not sure why this place is called NY Pizza - a Florida restaurant not knowing what they are doing and making it nothing even remotely close to any Pizza! Second, don't ever eat here. Did I already say that? By far the worst food I have ever eaten, ten notches below middle school cafeteria food. Pizza tasted like cardboard. They claim to have ""Sicilian"" pizza but more looked like a oval cheese board. Freezer fries would taste better than what they served which were string fries. They don't include marinara sauce with mozz sticks. Only positive, friendly service on the phone from a young woman.",0
5,We stayed during the aftermath of Hurricane Irma.  Everybody working was upbeat and helpful.We enjoyed a few meals in the restaurant well prepared and good portions.,2
3,"I like this place. It's nothing too special in terms of froyo, but it sure does hit the spot.",1
5,"Fantastic service! As a woman I'm usually nervous going in car places because I'm afraid I'll seem like a ditz. The staff here listened to me, helped change my headlights, and even taught me how to do it myself for the future. Just moved to the city from Tennessee and it's so nice to meet such nice folks. I know where I'll be going for any car stuff from now on!",2
5,"Very good prices!! The pho is great, love the subs and the summer rolls... I really can't get over the prices for how great the food is! I'm not a coffee drinker but friends love the Vietnamese style coffee as well.",2
4,"Well I read the other reviews and I have to disagree, I found the store delightful and a welcome change from typical Goodwill. I talked to the young ladies working and said what a pleasant experience it was shopping there. They told me the items offered are taken from overstock that would typically be warehoused. They do not pull from existing merchandise at GWs but from items that would be warehoused because there is no room for them in the GW store. So for those who still wish to treasure hunt at GW this does not preempt that thrill.For me, though, I liked that the items were somewhat more selective than a typical GW. I found three shirts which on any given day I would look at 3 different GWs around town and not find one. My total cost on them was $19.25. An Old Navy, Lee Rider and Tommy Bahama ($10 of the $19). For me it was more akin to consignment shopping and priced accordingly. I definitely think it's worth a look on any given day. The store is very nice and it's a more pleasant shopping experience than most consignment shops.",2
5,"Place is top notch for the area - and so is the pricing.  If you want classy then you can't go wrong here.Been a few times and always had a good meal.  I can't say much that put its in a different class then the other local stake houses though.One thing to note is their 'happy hours'.  I've had several meetings at the bar during that time (5:00 to 6:30?) where the drinks are $6 and so are their 'Bar Bites' menu.  They have mini crab cake, burger and stake sandwiches - three of each for $6.  The burger and stake sandwiches are rib-eye I believe and really good.  They also have $2 oysters.All in all - You can get a $195 shot of Lewi and a $175 porterhouse or a decent $6 sandwich and all with the same great service.**Please do the rest of us a favor and don't bring your kids here.  Thank you!**",2
3,"No complaints as far as Taco Bells go. Terrible for you and terribly delicious. This place is my fast food kryptonite. The service here is quick & friendly and they've never screwed up my order, which is more than I can say for other Taco Bell locations.",1
5,The duke calzone was super tasty and by far the best calzone I have ever had! You won't regret your decision to eat at Sause On The Side.,2
5,"I did a lot of research for fence businesses to compare quality, honesty, and professionalism. I chose Prince's Fences to install a privacy fence. Chuck, the owner, is easy to work with. He leaves his contact number and is very quick to return calls. I was impressed with Chuck and his team. Each one knowledgable, professional, and friendly. Give Prince's Fences consideration when you want consider fencing. I appreciate, too, that he answered all my questions concerning different options and why one fence might be better over another. Good job, Prince's Fences! Thank you.",2
5,"Fantastic, I repeat fantastic place to go for breakfast or brunch. We were steered here by 2 different locals, a bar tender and a fellow working in a hot sauce shop. The grits, andouille sausage, bacon were all perfect. The grits in particular.....we came back a few days later and had their breakfast burrata. It was spectacular. Deconstructed to its individual parts then allowing you to put each bite together however you like. So unbelievably good.......we will definitely be back next time in town!!",2
2,"Well you get what you pay for I guess.  The front desk staff were actually very professional and helpful. But, it went downhill from there.  The first room smelled like smoke.   The front desk staffed man was nice enough to run the key up to a new room, which made it right, but then the new room TV malfunctioned.  They just cut corners.   One washcloth,  shampoo but no conditioner. The bed was pillows were decent so like I said you get what you pay for.",0
5,"Great food at a great value!My favorite items on the menu are the Pho, Pork Bun, Bahn Mi, and the pot stickers are delicious!The Bahn Mi comes on true French bread (I recommend the pork belly). As for Pho, I usually get the beef with extra bean sprouts. Pork Bun is my favorite menu item, it comes with vermicelli noodles, cucumber, carrots, and more. The best server there her name is Tim. Ask for her if you want to get the best service!",2
5,Hannah is wonderful! I have come to her several times for waxing and tinting.  She always remember me and we have great conversations while she works her magic! I highly recommend her.,2
1,Hated this place I went in to try an egg roll and get a sushi roll and both were bad the egg was horrible and the sushi was chewy so I wasnt surprised that I was the only one there,0
2,"I am searching for a decent Thai place in the city, and we had Basil Spice delivered a few months ago. However, if we try ordering again for delivery, the woman on the phone has said either they aren't offering delivery tonight or that the driver wasn't in our neighborhood (though we had not yet placed an order). Not reliable.",0
2,"Not really sure what all the hype is about...wasn't overly impressed with the food. I suppose if you are a beer snob, one may appreciate this place. However, most bars are catering to beer snobs now and nothing about this place truly stands out from the other local bars...",0
1,"I love the bacon cheese burger, but everytime I come here no matter how busy it is or even when it's dead I get crap service with crap attitudes from servers. The food and its location being really close to my house are the only reasons I come back.",0
2,"Satisfactory  service, but was disappointed that the food came out TOO quick.  Main dishes were good (stuffed peppers and ribs) but we were convinced that the sides were microwaved.  Mac and cheese was not cold and collard greens were not good.  But great BBQ sauce!",0
5,"If you're looking for dentists who are detail oriented and friendly, precise dental is the right place to go to. The technicians were very skillful, and the dentist, Dr. Tanner, is very kind. He will discuss with you any concerns that you may have, and will make good referrals to other orthodontists or surgeons if needed. I think I found my new general dentist; Dr.Tanner is one of the best dentists that I have seen.",2
5,"Had a great four-day stay here, obviously.  The Hollander may not be Hilton-perfect (there is one of those several blocks away), but it's beyond quaint - it works well.  Most importantly, it's not expensive. And it's a beautifully remodeled historic building with gorgeous hardwood floors, polished to perfection. In addition to the nicely appointed rooms, the stairwells are comfortably furnished, floored with the same gorgeous hardwood.  Which I might not have known if they did not have a slow cozy elevator.  The fun lobby hosts all sorts of entertainment from singing to trivia nights - not only free, but winners might earn some Hollander bucks. The staff, from the desk to the maids, are personable and competent. If you don't want to stroll the few blocks downtown, The Hollander offers a open-air shuttle cart to the downtown area or any nearby destination, such as Tropicana Field (and yes, also free).On Tuesday nights, the Tap Room there will pour a large frosty mug of any one of their many craft beers for only $3. And the next night you may choose a craft beer and gourmet burger for just $10. Speaking of $10, they have a chef-hosted Sunday brunch for that price, too. Beyond burgers, they have a variety of entrees, including a tasty vegetarian eggplant stack. The only negatives I can come up with are, at least while I was there, the techno-crap lobby music they played early in the evening (before the real entertainment started) was not only horrible, some of few lyrics one could hear might've been offensive to families - it was just strange and at odds with the classy BnB feel of the place.  Also, the wifi didn't work well for me, but that might've been my laptop.  Like elevators, if you're looking for luxury showers pouring out waterfalls of perfectly temp-controlled water, this might not be the place for you.  Being an older place, no central air, and that's needed in July, so the in-room units run all the time - not ideal, but they worked well and didn't bother me too much.  One lamp and a cold CFL bulb, the other a warm incandescent which I liked (not sure what to make of that mix;-).  Also, they appear to be dog friendly, as there were a few very well-behaved and nice-looking dogs in the lobby.  Even though I didn't have a dog, I liked that, but perhaps someone else wouldn't.  Oh, and there were folks smoking outside - not much one can do about that here in Florida, but fortunately they have a nice large patio area and was enough enough to find some clean breathing space.Wow, I wrote many negatives, but still feels like a 5 to me.",2
1,"Coming from a person who's whole family is from the bayous of Louisiana it's ok. The roux on the gumbo is a little to thick. Gumbo over jambalaya is almost insulting. Po boy wasn't a po boy it was more like a Hoagie with Cole slaw a semi blackened chicken. The flavor is kinda close (if you are a rookie to this food). If you have never had REAL creole/Cajun food you'll love it. I am of creole descent and I grew up on this food ,but like I said if you go to Louisiana (especially bayous were it started not new Orleans) you'll know what I'm talking about. For rookie creole/Cajun palates it's descent though.",0
1,Both times we have come to this location the service is remarkably slow during non peak hours. the employees don't seem to listen when we order. For example I had to tell one person my order 3 times and when I repeated myself they seemed like I was imposing on them. The food is standard for Wendy's but the customer service is terrible. I won't go back which is rather unfortunate because it's just down the street.,0
1,"Broadband wireless in Lockwood is almost non-existen for 3GB users.  I get ""Optimized"" about 75% of the time. ""Optimized,"" as in you're connected, but no data is being transmitted to you so you have no internet servece.  Verizon does this intentionally, I believe, to force 3GB users to upgrade to the more expensive 4GB service. Verizon told me that ""4GB service isn't optimized, so you get uninterrupted service.""  What the tech, in effect, was telling me is that Verizon is intentionally defrauding me of internet service to force me to buy a more expensive service.  After 20 or more complaints to the 611 tech support, I give up.  The 611 people won't give me the name and business address of the regional manager for me to contact in this matter.  Today I'll be going to the City Business Licensing devision to file a complaint of unthical business practices.  I am also going Lawyer shopping to see if any attorney would like to get involved in a Civil Suit for Verizon defrauding me of service I pay for.  My recommendation is to not use Verizon services, because the tech support is crap!",0

2,"Ru San's is interesting... to say the least! My wife and I are regular sushi eaters, and we always somehow end up back at Ru San's (I am beginning to think it's because it is close to where we live).Positives:The menu is extremely creative and gargantuan! I love that they have some cheaper options, and plenty of variety.Negatives:Ru San's has the worst service I have ever had. On a typical dinner night out with my wife (even on odd weekdays), it has taken us over 2 hours to get out of there. The waiters seem to either disappear, or have so many tables that we tend to get neglected. On many occasions we have set at our table without drinks and with requests for more than 30 minutes before finally flagging down another server to find our server.The food is good, but seems to take a longer time to come out than usual places. They have recently raised their prices a little, so be prepared to eat $50 worth of sushi!",0
5,"Great place to chill with a drink. Process time is short, and tastes are good. Excellent location.",2
4,"Great addition to the ""Funk Zone"" setting.They have good beer, mainly representing local IPA brew. The food is really good yet small in portion.I would recommend this happening spot.",2

1,Ordered 4 pot pies she said they have them made. Then manager takes one and says I have to wait 20 minutes for another one and I should order something else. Every time I come here there's a problem. Go somewhere else.  How is a 20 minute menu item that is all over TV even a fast food item?,0
4,West Ave. Grill- Its a happy place in Jenkintown with a lot of locals eating outside under umbrellas with their dogs at their feet and kids on their lap.  Inside their is a large and small area with a bar to eat and look past the parking lot to nicer part of Jenkintown town square.  The wait staff is always nice and the owner is often around to talk to.  Free dum dum lolly pops at the counter as you walk out and news papers to read if you are eating alone or want to check in on the Phillies.Food- always good. Great pancakes that are fluffy and crispy on the edges.  Kansas City  is a great breakfast too- for the most part great.Big salads could have more Stuff in them- more of the things that are supposed to be there- as described etc.  But a complaint is readily heard and they always try to make you happy.  It's Nice- try it.,2
5,"Stoney River has some of the best service anywhere around Nashville. My husband and I dined here tonite. And the food tasted wonderful and the service was perfection. The manager came over to make sure all was well, and Fay, our waitress could not have been better. If you're looking for a nice romantic relaxed evening, make Stoney River your date destination. We love this place.",2
4,"This was a stop on the Harry Potter pub crawl, had a great 'Dirty Dumbledore' to go along with delicious chicken broccoli and wild pepper chicken, fantastic!",2
5,"Seeing as though this restaurant was directly across the street from our hotel, we opted for convenience, and safety (as it was Bayou Classic weekend).Luckily, having no reservations, we were immediately seated. Our servers were great, and had excellent product knowledge. I was sold on a Blantons, and the Wife went with some vodka concoction, that was also excellent. For a starter, we went with the seafood gumbo. Amazing.For our entrees, the Wife had a white fish, with crab meat, and I went with the shrimp and grits. We scarfed down these entrees like starving Ethiopians. The food was really that good. As far as my shrimp and grits, it was, by far, the best I've ever had.Perfect food, excellent drinks, and great service. I can't wait to try a John Besh restaurant again.",2
3,"Look, I like the place and featured donuts did not disappoint.  But lets be honest with a line like that, how does a selfie happen?  Huh?  St. Louis?  Huh?  Strange Donuts?  I find that a little unusual and now my near perfect selfie-foursquare check in ratio has been irreconcilably tarnished so I'm taking a star off because selfie in the age of Mark Zuckerberg, in the age of Obama you're gonna have a shop too crowded to take a decent selfie?  PALEESE.  Also they have no paleo/gluten free options so another star off, I mean WHAT THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO FEED MY FOUR AND SIX YEAR OLD?!",1
2,"Went there yesterday (Oct 25) at about 4:00 PM. Had the nitro and it was delicious, hence earning the two stars.However, like *many* other reviewers here, the service is awful. Not only were we an apparent nuisance to the baristas reviewing Halloween costumes with their (boy)friends, but also were treated with, as one other customer said, much shade.I brought my own cup in which to have my coffee. However, when I asked if she could put the drink in my cup, I received elevator eyes, a smirk, and a clear, ""No"". Ok, I thought, sometimes sizes are difficult to estimate in a different cup.Then, as we were sitting down enjoying our coffees, I turned around to look at the counter for WiFi info. I received a stern look from the barista, who then exclaimed ""Can I hep you with something?"", to which I responded, ""oh, I was just looking if you had WiFi."" The barista responded, ""We have a sign, for you,"" again with a plethora of shade.Will never return, thanks for trying.",0
2,"Open air to the street is nice.Tables are WAY too small and cramped together. Service was especially slow with half the place empty.Bacon blood mary had a funny taste to it, I probably got a bad batch.Food was decidedly mediocre.Nothing I can really recommend about coming here.",0
4,Messy presentation and eating. Don' t wear nice clothes. The service was above average and they also explained the menu. The taste was on point for a medium spicy rajun cajun.,2
4,"Lunch here was such a lovely experience! Not only was our server attentive, knowledgeable and sweet, but the food was delicious! I've never been to New Orleans (I think I'd get into some serious trouble there, so I've just stayed away!), but I'd like to think that all the cuisine there tastes this great. Get the crab meat/mushroom bisque...you won't be disappointed, and for the love of God, save room for the banana cream pie. And make sure to take a look around the dining room - it's gorgeous. I hope that someday before I kick it, I'll have a chandelier like the one in the bathroom.",2
5,"Never have I had such a delicious crepe outside of Paris, maybe even in Paris. I ordered 3 crepes ($30 Groupon), 2 savory, 1 sweet, and each was the essence of perfection. The crepe itself was soft with a warm buttery flavor and had a slight crispiness to the outside. Just incredible. The inside was well seasoned (savory) and had just the right balance of ingerdients.After taking the first bite, it was so good that I didn't know if I could stop myself from stuffing it into my mouth as fast a possible, but I knew that I should slow down to savor every morsel.The service was perfection and the only drawback was the slightly high prices. But hey, you get what you pay for. I will definitely be coming back...and bringing all of my friends :)",2

4,Dr. Terance Cochrane has been my eye doctor for 15 continuous years now (I did see him as a teenager before moving out of state in the early 90's).  His service has been consistent and efficient every time.  He stays on top of new advances in eye treatment and is his own patient and an early adopter as well.  We both had Lasik done to our eyes in 2000 (it was hard to argue against Lasik if your own doctor is doing it!).  His staff is all friendly and there is a complete eye wear center on site.  His office also seems to be flexible with insurance carriers - mine has changed about 4 times in the last 5 years and he has accepted them all.,2
1,"Terrible Service! I went there with a co worker around 5pm to get drinks using a giftcard I got from RiteAid.com. I've been there a couple times because their chicken fingers are delicious! When I got there, I told the bartender that I had 2 /$10 coupons(only because it didnt allow me to buy $20), she said I could only use one coupon per month. So I said 'okay well then we'll just be getting some drinks.' She never said anyrhing else. So when we get the bill, the owner came over and told me to never come back!! All because we didnt order food and he thought I was scamming him!! (If she said we had to buy food then we would have) Then said shouted that doesn't support alcoholism! (But owns a bar) I can't believe because I had 3 beers after work on a Monday, I'm considered an alcoholic! The bill was about $18 and I was going to give a good tip but.... I'm never going back. Just like another review I saw for this place- ""These people judge a book by its cover."" If you don't want people to use the coupons!! don't offer to be on the website!!. It's simple. Such bad business!",0
5,"This place is absolutely delightful. I am seldom able to sneak to this part of the city, but when I do and the hour is right, I rush here. The macrons are always to die for, each melting in your mouth (even after sitting in the quaint box for a few days). The Darkness Croissant is my favorite but so rich it takes multiple sittings to consume. The Harry Potter themed desserts brought me in yesterday where I purchased a few specialties. The Tonk's Chouquette was beautiful and light with a fun cherry center. The pumpkin pasties went great with a cup of tea. I have the Molly's Meat Pie ready to go for my lunch today. Honestly, I could have gotten one of each of the new treats if my budget allowed it.Overall, this place makes my day each time I visit. Staff is friendly and the atmosphere is elegant. Spot on.",2
4,Food was reasonably priced and the portions were large. Half priced sushi on Wednesday is awesome. Service was really good. I would give it a try.,2
3,"It's just one giant room. There's no flow-through for the meandering crowds. It's all just one big, long, irritating room. You're either being crushed in the front or bumped into by passing patrons in the back. Cheap, huge, strong drinks. Bigger than normal-sized shots. I got impossibly hammered here, but was frustrated with the layout.I'll probably go back because they host good shows.",1
5,"So we've been here a couple times, I decided to review it this time because it really is a wonderful place to come! They have their own version of city wide specials for $5, which is amazing paired with their cheese board, as strange as that may seem. We originally came here for the crawfish mac & cheese which ended up being the side highlight, it didn't really have a savory crawfish taste in every bite, but either way we still love this place!!",2
4,Cozy dive bar right next to a pretty seedy motor lodge. Excellent selection of craft beers along with top and bottom shelf liquors. The bathrooms have some pretty cool art painted on the walls as well.,2
5,I love this place. Best sushi in Tampa. The staff is always friendly and dies a great job. I've never had a bad experience here. You can sit at the bar and watch them create your meal or a table. They have free WiFi so you can make it a working meal. They do deliver which is another bonus.  I've had them deliver several times and the online system is a little clunky and one time we had a rude experience when the driver couldn't figure out how our condo gate worked.,2
5,"The best little spot for dinner or lunch in Kenner. The gumbo or turtle soup are great ways to start your meal. I firmly believe the turtle soup at Harbor seafood is better than Commanders Palace. If you don't want soup to start look hard at the frog legs. All the poboys are good, the oyster or half and half seafood are the way to go. The boiled shrimp or crawfish are size able portions and seasoned just right. Always take a look at the daily specials, the cooks are always whipping something up worth considering. Lastly Abita beer is always cold and cheap.",2
3,"nice restaurant, but small. the lighting is not good for us 40+...smile. there were 6 of us and we were at a back table, quite snug. I had buffalo wings & fries, which were good. they could have taken the tips off though. my family members had salmon, a burger, & duck. they enjoyed their meals.  I may be back for the wings.",1
4,"We were in Yats a few weeks ago and were disturbed to find that they had stopped taking credit cards.  Not to worry, they gave us our lunch on I.O.U.  Now, what kind of place does that?There was probably 4 other folks while we were there who got an IOU.  Everyone came back within a few minutes of finishing their meal and paid the bill.",2
4,"$5 mimosas to follow a new years eve hangover? You had me at hello. Pub and Kitchen is a very relaxed and easygoing hangout spot with good food to match. The bf and I were both craving some red meat so we decided to try P&K. We were seated in the back little private dining room which is cozy with lots of small tables, exposed brick, and natural light. The burger was cooked to my liking and they were very accommodating to some topping substitutions. I loved the fries and the food, the waiter was extremely cool. The only downside - and it had nothing to do with P&K - was the fact that because of the mummers parade there seemed to be tons of loud families in what would usually not be a typical family establishment. I love kids as much as the next gal but sometimes (usually after a night of heavy drinking) you just want to eat your burger and drink your alchy sans rugrats.",2
3,"Its a local deli. Prices are high, but that is the normal deal for places like this. They don't always put prices on their stuff which is sometimes annoying. I go here often because it is close, all the employees are very friendly and they always pet my dog.",1
4,"I went here last night with some of my friends. Good place, but nothing to RAVE over. I got the beet and goat cheese salad which was sub par. The vegetable platter was amazing though! Huge! Good place to go with friends, but nothing AMAZING. Good location and we sat outside!",2
4,Barro's is a great place for a couple of slices. The lunch specials are a great value for the money and there is a good variety to chose from.,2
5,This place is amazing. Staff is friendly. Food is great. Don't miss out on the chorizo and cheese empanada! Chips and guacamole are also amazing. Make sure you check in to get a free empanada.,2
2,"Woah! I was all excited for some sidewalk dining today and came across this place that I had passed a brazillion times. Thinking that a sandwich would make me feel like a gross pig and a salad just wouldn't cut it, I decided to grab a table and chow down on some sushi. Which was pretty good when coupled with a cocktail - until I got the freakin' bill. $28 dollars for some spicy tuna and a drink is just a little insane, dont'cha think? Great service and the food was good enough, but sweet Christ on a cracker - I won't be going back unless I suddenly get a sugar daddy with an Old City fetish (read: not bloody likely).",0
4,"Updating my review as our last two visits here have been much improved. Im not sure if they have new management but whatever they're doing makes this a viable fastfood stop for Bellevue. The service is friendly and fast and orders have been correct / fresh (for fast food!) Management, keep up the good work as its noticed and appreciated.",2
5,"Cake Bake is a must-visit if you are in Indy! Not only is the cake amazing, but the entire experience of your lunch/tea date/after-school treat is one of a kind. Every single detail is perfection. From the edible glitter on the cakes, brownies and cookies to the ornate silverware and platters to the French champagne, to the pink receipt paper, you will be in pretty pink princess heaven! It is over the top in the best kind of way. So fun for a girls date, bridal shower or a mommy and me outing. Today we celebrated with Red Velvet and 'Millionaire' cake and the sparkling (literally with floating glitter!) lemon lavender champagne as my sister found her dream wedding dress at a local bridal shop. Such a fun time!",2
3,I previously reviewed this place because its my go to for cheesesteaks and such .... .... I still consider this place my favorte go to for such things and omg french fries yumm ... However i decided to try the pizza but the pizza was not my cup of tea .... It was pizza looked like chuck e cheese pizza ... WHATEVER IM PREGNANT .  it was bad !!! tasted like beer the cheese was rubbery ..... And it wasint the dough that tasted like beer it was sauce or cheese ugh .... This is 100% my go to for cheese steaks and chicken cheesesteaks and again the YUMMY fries ..... The chicken fingers are good too ... My stay away from on the pizza front it sucks too because they are always timely and nice !!,1
5,"Wow has this place turned around. I've been going in weekly for quick print jobs. The staff is on top of it, courteous and helpful. Very impressed!",2
1,"Placed a to go order, had to repeat it multiple times over the phone and it was still wrong when I picked it up. Unfortunately I had little time and didn't have time to have it fixed. I was not offered anything but excuses and unfortunately I do not think I will be returning because of this experience.",0
5,Absolutely amazing!The employees know you by name and are always laughing and smiling. They are extremely professional and have the best attitudes!I always get the same couple of things but are always so delicious! My husband likes to get something different every few times and never has a complaint.,2
4,Update! Oh my what happened? It's still a great spot but something is different! We went a few days ago and everything was off! The charro beans my favorite didn't have the same flavor. The guacamole was a disappointment in comparison to the usual guacamole. It was still good but not great! And Pepsi products! Ahhhh and no tea! What happened to the aqua Fresca?? What happened? Did the cooks change? Owners? I know you got your liquor license congratulations but y'all need to get your groove back! Had to drop a star sorry until next time. My new favorite Mexican restaurant! The food is fantastic. The guacamole is perfect I always have to add something not here. The tacos are perfect if you can choose! The Playeros tacos with shrimp bacon cream cheese stuffed jalapeños and more were so yummy! My niece said I don't know what's going on in my mouth but it is awesome! Lol The Pastor tacos are great with the grilled pineapple! I only wish you could have a choice of 3 different tacos as a platter since the selection is so tasty. My favorite side is definitely the charro beans! Has a great flavor and I really think they should put them on the menu as a soup! Last but not least the flan! Oh the flan save some room...it was superb. Prices are really good $15 for the 3 taco platter with two sides. Now these are not the small tortillas that are plaguing many restaurants now! These are regular sized tortillas people with premium ingredients!,2
5,I LOVE the Fountain!! This is my favorite restaurant in St Louis! All of their food is delicious and interesting. Not your ordinary sandwiches and salads. Obviously the ice cream and ice cream martinis are great but I am partial to the Hemingway which is absinthe and champagne!,2
3,I'm giving a THREE only because steph was an AMAZING bartender... The security.. The Mexican dude was a dick and wouldn't let me use the restroom.. I literally JUST walked out after spending $100 bucks and the fucking dick wouldn't let me in just to use the restroom.. The white dude totally wanted to let me but I guess the asshole cocksucker wouldn't let me. #ThatsWhyYouAreSecurityBitch,1
4,"Order on a piece of paper, pay at the front, and keep walking to pick your order: Fast service!!Had the cheese and chips. Can't let the cheese sit too long but it is pretty good.Had the Beef Enchilada plate. It was pretty good. The beans are a bit dry and the rice could be hard so just focus on the enchiladas because they are good and you will enjoy it.Soda fountain so drink to your heart's content.",2

5,"Ah, Wissahickon Trail ... I want to set up a tent and live on you forever. Seriously, you made me forget all about the screaming kids from my neighborhood, the wretched stench of the city on a hot day and, well, pretty much anything else discomforting about city life.What more could I ask for from a life partner?",2
4,Great time here. Younger crowd but the musicians are awesome and the vibe is amazing.,2
5,This neighborhood place is a hidden gem! I had the Mexican enchilada platter and I was delicious. The neighboring table had the fajitas and the aroma from that sizzling platter was amazing. Since I live close I will definitely be making this a regular spot.,2
3,"I made a reservation at Muriel's for myself and three friends, after reading the glowing reviews. We wanted to eat somewhere fun and elegant over the holidays, and Muriel's fit the bill. Overall, it was a leisurely dining experience in a nice atmosphere, but there were some missteps.First, the menu and prices on the website were different than what we were given in the restaurant. Not a big deal unless you have your heart set on something before you go.Then, we were served in a weird order. Three of us ordered the prix fixe menu, which includes appetizer, entree and dessert. One friend also ordered a salad and I ordered an oyster appetizer in addition to our prix fixe dinner. First, my two friends got their goat cheese crepe appetizer and I got my oysters. Then, after we ate that, they brought out MY goat cheese appetizer and my friend's salad. I would have thought they would have brought our oysters and salad first, then bring all of the goat cheese appetizers, but whatever.The oyster appetizer was simply okay: fried oysters set atop shells containing creamed spinach. The parmesan cheese on top was crunchy and not pliable. Obviously not their signature dish.The shrimp and goat cheese crepes were to die for. The crepe was light and tender and the cheese filling was creamy and savory. There was something off with the shrimp though...they were those transparent shrimp, I don't think they were gulf shrimp.For my entree, I had the pecan crusted puppy drum. Only certain bites of it were flavorful for some reason. I tasted my friend's chicken and it was terribly dry. I tasted the other friend's barbeque shrimp, it was so delicious, it made me regret ordering the fish.The flourless chocolate cake was really good. The servers (all women) were very professional.My dining companions and I all dressed up, but there were many diners there in jeans and t-shirts.TIP: Do not park in the French Market lot behind Cafe du Monde. Muriel's validates for up to 3 hours, so it's very tempting. The lot is dark and isolated and there are not visible security personnel around. When we were going back to our car, there was a guy in an alley, sitting on a bike. As soon as we passed, he pulled out and rode behind us all the way to the entrance of the lot. When we turned right to go to our car, he rode off to the left, and we breathed a temporary sigh of relief. Within two seconds, he made a u-turn and started pedaling to catch up to us. My friend and I RAN to the car and jumped in, and he rode past us, circling the lot. When we got to the ticket booth, we informed the cashier that a man on a bike was lurking around the lot and we asked if they had a security person who could pass through the lot. She acted like she couldn't understand what we were saying and waved us off with a a dismissive, ""Okay, okay.""  Pay the extra money and park in a more populated, well-lighted area.",1
5,"Yat's Cajun, Creole, Crazy? More like Yat's Cajun, Creole, Crazy Good!This place is on my list of Indianapolis institutions, much like the Colts, The IMA and the Indianapolis Fever. It's the coolest, funkiest, and best food you can buy for under $5. The ever changing menu is without a doubt one of the best things. Going in each time offers some old favorites as well as giving patrons a chance to try something new. If you tend to shy away from anything labeled vegetarian I must protest, while no one enjoys a good chunk of med. rare beef like I do, some of the best food in town is vegetarian, and at Yat's that is as true as anywhere else. The Spinach and Mushroom etouffe is one of the best plates of unappetizing looking food you'll ever eat. It's delicious on many levels, I order it anytime it's on the menu, though anything with craw fish on it is usually awesome too. Say hello to the funky looking dudes behind the bar and ask for a sample if you just aren't sure, but don't pass up a chance to check out one of Indy's best holes in the wall. Though they may be expanding into Chicago, they are still in my mind, Indy's best creation.",2
5,"I'm not sure if it's 100% vegetarian, but their tofu and green beans is awesome.",2
4,"Definitely a fan of this place, Citizens Bank Park.  I like the arena itself. I am a mets and former fan of the evil empire, Yankees, so I don't know if me and most Philly fans get along.  I had the best time here though before in the two games I visited.  It was a on the whim drive here from NY to catch a sunday night baseball Nationally televised game BRAVES-PHILLIES.  Seats were a lot cheap than both citified and yankee stadium and the drive home that late at night was not that bad.I recommend a visit here if you are in the area. Great food and great views of the field from almost any seat.  Another cool fact about this philly arena is that the other team stadium are right there, PRETTY much on the same block.  IT is like if in New York, we had madison square garden, giants stadium and citified all lined up next to each other basically a three block radius.  I thought that was pretty cool.  cHECK out Citzens Bank Park at least once, even if you have to root for the other team and hopeful avoid getting in some fistfights.",2
4,"LOOOOOOOOVE this place! The ambiance is nice, the food is great, and the staff is friendly. Everything on the menu is delicious, but my favorite way to end my meal is with the churros and chocolate! Definitely the best part. I would recommend this place a thousand times over for a good breakfast meet up with friends.",2
5,"OK, it's 7:39 am and  I just got my caffeine fix decided to try brooklawn, it's in a big shop center where I am joining a gym starting my new year's resolution early. The place clean , moves fast and my salted caramel coffee is perfect. Luv my flavored coffees at DD. Def, try the waffle sandwich egg, cheese its very good but I am trying to cut down on carbs and it's hard but def the waffle breakfast sandwich was worth it . Def glad I stopped by and bought a thermal stainless for keeping my coffee hot!; They do a big drive in business , huge line as I pulled up. Coffee hot and keeping me warm with the very windy chilly morning it's starting out , hope it warms up a bit. def a warm weather girl at heart. check out my new  thermal cup. !!!",2
3,"We stopped in for drinks and apps. My friend wanted a frozen drink and we were told they didn't have a blender. There was one I saw on the way out but it must have been broken. We ordered the tachos and they were delicious and a generous portion. The service was fine, we didn't stay long to really gauge much of that and it was pretty empty.  The deck was beautiful and had a great view.",1
5,I love the atmosphere in Hyde Perk not only do I love being in the north end but this little coffee shop is so comfortable and relaxing. Its quiet at just the right times and I love their friendly staff. I tried their Kombucha it was a blueberry flavor and it was so tasty! Definitely going back to study or just hang out with close friends!,2
5,"The easiest car buying experience ever! I worked out the details of the purchase with salesman Larry LaRose on the phone prior to arriving at the dealership. I was nervous that once I went in person, the terms would all of a sudden change but Larry stuck to his word. He made sure I paid no more than what we discussed before and I didn't feel like I was being pressured to ""buy up"" at all. The finance dept was equally impressive. Overall, I highly recommend this dealership!",2
1,Poor selection of slot machines.Tried the buffet and had bad service. Never had anyone check up on me or even get me a refill with an empty cup sitting on the table over half an hour. Food was also not good quality. Also felt sick the next day.Went to a concert and it was delayed but they did not allow the band to play their full set.I would still come back for concerts but not for any other reason. Also I would eat off property first.,0

4,"""Just because it's vegan, doesn't mean it's healthy"" reported a friend of a friend, and I think he's totally right--in a good way.On one of the first chilly days of Fall, I was not in the mood to gnaw on a fibrous salad for lunch. I wanted something warm and indulgent--and just vegan and eco-friendly enough for me to bask in a little first-world smug.  So, I got the crispy chick'n sandwich and sweet potato fries; both of these items really just hit the spot.  If you're looking for a healthier meal there are other items to choose from, and honestly, other places to go in the city. However, if you're looking to fill a Chik-fil-a sandwich sized hole in your soul--this may be for you.Some notes: Sandwich is very good--bun may be a little much and they may be a tad generous with their ranch dressing, but these things are easily amended.Fries--great--and this was after having to walk it back to my office a half mile away (yes, in the cold). What makes it better are the sauces: siracha aoli (YUM!) and black bean cilantro (yum).Overall service was really personable and decor was lovely. Yes, it is a little pricey, but most vegan options tend to be..and yes, it relies heavily on faux meats, but keep in mind that sandwich sized hole in your soul.",2
3,"The park has a great playground and a cute splash pad.  There are family friendly private bathrooms next to splash pad, but unfortunately most of seating for the parents around the splash pad and playground are in the sun.  There are shady places around them, so bringing your own folding chair would be good if you plan on staying awhile.  My two year old played there for 3 hours between the splash pad and playground, and would have stayed longer if I let her.  The playground and splash pad are in the same enclosure, so water shoes would also be a good idea bc the pavement around the playground gets hot.  I do like that they are enclosed so my kid is confined that one area.  The playground does have different age sections for toddlers to older kids.",1
3,"Has been there forever. Pizza is never reliably good. When it's good, it's delicious. When it's not so good, it's terrible. Usually greasy. Normally I don't blot my pizza with napkins but I always have to when I get spatolas. Good if your only dropping in for a slice and some garlic knots.",1

Believe it not I dont have any complaints about Panda Express, I think its great, its just one of those places where if you choose to go here and its not good all you can do is slap yourself and ask yourself WHAT DID YOU REALLY EXPECT and go about your day! One thing for sure - its is REALLY quick and thats perfect when your in a hurry!",1

1,"Bad service, bad food - just don't.   Besides service being slow (and with a 3 year old that is never a good thing) the food was less than stellar.  I got an egg white omelet that was swimming in oil - greasy beyond being edible.  It took the waiter quite awhile to notice I wasn't eating and when he came over and asked I explained that it was inedible. At that point I didn't even want anything else so he left and left the food on the table.  15 min later he comes back and takes the plate because the chef wanted to see it.  It wasn't until after this that he offered to deduct it from the check.  Meanwhile my daughter spills a full class of apple juice.  I'm using bar napkins to mop it up and had to make several trips to the bar to get more.  Several staff members saw me cleaning the spill off the floor and not one offered to help or get a mop.  On top of that all my daughters chicken was dry and stringy.  She was starving and ate it bathed in ketchup but it was not good.  Thanks but no thanks",0
5,"Best gelato we have ever had. The staff is always friendly and courteous. Very creative and delicious combo of ingredients. They have flavor combo you will not get anywhere else, never had a flavor that was not perfection.The bubble gum has hard gum balls I would caution for kids. The dark chocolate is to die for, combined with a fruit of your liking it was just amazing.",2
5,"Zorba's is one of those Fairmount staples. I prefer to go there when I can get an outside table, or when I visit with a particular group of friends who also share in my sentiment of fondness. Now what the heck took me so long to experience Zorba's delivery?! Shame on me. It's the same delicious food, just in my pajamas in front of my TV. Having experienced a day that could only be fixed by delivery, my husband handled all of the order details. I believe he placed directly with them, as we were able to pay in cash when the delivery guy arrived. The wait time was standard- I don't recall it arriving early nor do I recall being antsy about its whereabouts. I'm no stranger to the Imam Baldi. I think every time I have this eggplant in red sauce soufflé, I go on the record that this dish can turn me into a vegetarian. It came with the standard sides of rice, veggies and potatoes, all separated by little dividers as to not mingle. We were first timers to the Skordalia. Think extra, extra whipped mashed potatoes with extra, extra garlic. Move over (already fabulous hummus), you may have just been replaced in our repertoire. Okay, I kid. We'll just get both and have leftovers.Speaking of leftovers, we totally were able to split our order into two meals. Score!  Love that fresh bread they put on the table? Don't worry, you get that too. I'll still visit their actual location, but it's really good to know that I can get my Zorba's fix in the comfort of my own home.",2

1,"My boyfriend and I took his grandparents to Docs to celebrate his grandfathers 60th birthday. We regret going there and I wish we would've taken them to a different restaurant. I made a reservation 4 days in advance and when we showed up they said they didn't see the reservation. We still got a table but it was right up front near the door and it was very uncomfortable. We had trouble getting situated at our high table and his grandparents had an ever harder time. We ordered oysters and none of them were cut properly so we had to scrape them out with our forks before we could eat them. After our appetizers came my boyfriends grandfather had to use the restroom and when we came back he told us there wasn't any soap so he told one of the employees. He intended to go wash his hands when our meals came out so that they would have plenty of time to refill the soap. Our meals came and he went back in the bathroom and the soap still wasn't refilled. Luckily, we had our own bottle of hand sanitizer with us so he had to resort to using hand sanitizer before eating his meal. The worst part is that he ordered a lobster roll. So it wasn't like he was eating with silverware. He had to eat his birthday meal with his hands that he couldn't even get soap to wash. Our total bill was around $160 and I really do not think we should've had to pay $160 for a meal that we couldn't even wash our hands before we ate it. We will never go back to Docs. I actually feel embarrassed we took our guests there to celebrate.",0
4,"Kalamata's is a Greek and Mediterranean casual restaurant located near Green Hills mall. They have a good reputation for being a great place for a quick cheap bite. I prefer getting something here at Kalamata's over any  other fast food, because Kalamata's is really just as fast and the food is infinitely better, and the same price!  They have lunch specials that are really a bargain. I can't really comment on the authenticity, I've never been to Greece... but I think their food is full of flavor. I am a fan of the falafel here.  That's what I always like to order.  Get over to Kalamata's for lunch, try to come early or late to beat the rush though.",2

In the more recent visits, the buffet has gone down hill.  It does not have as many varieties for Veggies, the Nann was cold & stale, the soup container was empty.In previous visits, the staff was very friendly and accommodating.  On this recent visit, no smiles, welcoming, etc. - we were just seated, given our beverages and said to go to the buffet.I wouldn't rule them out and would certainly try them again, if in the area.

The service is superb, and So hail and his wife are always kind and very eloquent.  When I eat there I feel at home and feel a sense of gentleness around them. As an employer, Sohail is very friendly and welcoming to the refugee community which is so important. Some of my favorites are the chicken korma, bhindi masala, and of course, chai. Honestly, this restaurant has been a staple to the Boise community for years and offers many vegan options as well. It's always my first choice for date nights, lunches in between working with clients, and take out. Much love to Taj Mahal! Xx be easy",2
1,"Stopped by the drive thru which moved much slower than what's reasonable, then picked up my 7 piece meal. Was in a bit of a hurry so trusted them to fulfill the order for what I paid for, should have know better. How in the world can they sack up and order that has items that are standard with every order I have no idea. To make matters worse, I called since the distance we live it's not practical just to jump in the car and go back for the items they screwed up on. No one would answer the phone for several minutes. After multiple attempts, a girl finally answered. When I asked to speak with a Manager, she just hesitated and said ok. Then she literally put the phone down, and I could hear their conversation, none of which involved needing a Mgr on the phone. Hung up after a few mins, only to call and call to listen to a busy signal. The food itself was ok, chicken seemed like it had been cooked for awhile and the amount of wasted extra skin made small pieces look huge. Clearly this location has lost it's way but I even filled out a customer survey on the receipt asking to speak with a Mgr or GM, even the owner. Never even heard from a line cook so Churchs as a whole must have no regard for customer service. Why even have a survey on the receipt? If they had just answered the dang phone that day and addressed the situation I would have possibly returned to get my items they shorted me and it would have been over. Why would I, or anyone, want to give them another chance after such abysmal service.",0
5,"The food here is delicious, fast, and consistent every single time. We generally get the cucumbers, dan dan, wontons, dry pot fish, three cup chicken, and garlic style beef. All are delicious and of different spice levels so that we get a variety of heat and flavor. I'm always bringing friends here who haven't been before. They always keep coming back and bringing new people as well. This place is solid and as long as it's open, I'll keep coming back.",2
3,"I've been wanting to try this place since I moved to St. Pete a few weeks ago. I'm not disappointed or wowed, but I will take a few more trips to this place to give a more comprehensive review. They have a decent assortment of sandwiches, bagels and donuts. I can tell the bagels are made fresh, which is a plus. I was really excited to see they have lox cream cheese so I got that on an onion bagel. It was good, but nothing special. The cream cheese was not pack with flavor and I have had better bagels elsewhere in the area.Also the donuts look good and taste average as well. I got a plain yeast which was light in sweetness and texture. Though, it kind of reminded me of the ones you can get at a grocery store. Overall there prices are pretty good though. My ice coffee, bagel w/ cream cheese and donut order came to $5.45",1

5,"Eclipse Pizza defines what a tasty pie + gourmet toppings is.  The bicycle friendly house-like restaurant is nestled in a neighborhood like commercial area on the corner of McCarran and Mayberry Dr. Besides just pizzas they also have gourmet salads and of course, calzones.On my first time there, we got calzones to go: Mine = Hawaiian w/ pineapple, mushrooms(normally ham), macadamia nuts, pesto sauce & mozziMy Pals' = The Grecian w/ Kalamata Olives, roasted peppers, roasted garlic, tomato sauce & feta cheeseOn the second time, I took 2 little ones aged 6 & 10 where we went simple and got half cheese and half artichoke and chicken.  I think this was where I really noticed the savory-delicious taste of Eclipse Pizza's Red sauce and their salads. The atmosphere is very relaxed and although I tend to prefer take-away, I will look forward to the few times I will be dining in with friends and a wine or a beer.",2

4,"My first trip to New Orleans, and my first meal here. Ordered the fried green tomatoes and Crawfish Pasta, husband had the seafood gumbo and the Mr.B's Barbecued shrimp. Before I even get to the food, let me just say that the service here is impeccable. We had 3 different people waiting on us. Normally, this is a mess, but at Mr B's, they all communicated with each other. We got our food quickly (drinks took a little bit longer but we were hungry so we didn't care) and thy apologized for that. As soon as you leave for the bathroom, one of the waitresses comes over and  folds up your napkin-Michelin star style. The MrB's BBQ'd shrimp was my favorite, very smoky and peppery and full of flavor. Hey also provide warmed bagged bread. The bread pudding dessert was also great!",2
4,"I got a mint chocolate waffle cone, and it was delicious. One scoop is a ton and will surely get you by! My husband had a coffee waffle cone, which was also really good! The service was nice, not super chatty or overly enthusiastic, but he was pleasant. I would definitely go here again and try the cookies!!",2
5,"Honestly I have been to over half the breweries in the Tampa /St Pete area and this is by far one of my favorites! Some breweries just make beer but Angry Chair makes amazing beer! Some I recommend is their German Chocolate Cupcake Stout, The Awakening, and any barley wine or IPA. I keep going back to get more in a growler wishing I can get a keg but they keep refusing. I hope I can sweet talk them in to giving me a keg of the cupcake stout but until then I will keep getting growler fills. Must must visit! Careful parking is limited ""don't park on Fern"" you will understand when you visit!",2
3,The salad was very good pizza was excellent!!! The 805 keg blow during my pour and they didn't have a replacement but they were very accommodating and gave me a Stella... Great customer service!!!,1
5,"I'm from LA and currently live in Vegas, I know good Mexican food and man was this food good. Girlfriend and I were on vacation visiting New Orleans, we decided to try out Mexican food and found this spot. The prices weren't bad at all and the food was freshly made. Joel, our server was awesome and made us feel at home. Answered all our questions and even had a normal conversation with us as if he's known us for years. The owner as well had a conversation with us. Real cool atmosphere and people. The set up is great, next time we're in NOLA we are for sure coming back to this spot!",2
2,"We had the opportunity to stay here last weekend. The building/facilities are very nice! The customer service is not good at all! I had two interactions with the front desk on issues with safe and hair dryer not working. These were separate calls on separate days. Both interactions the desk was rude, had no information on the problems at hand. All they wanted to do was transfer my call and not answer the questions I was asking. The other issue was the amount of jetskies parked at the private beach. Whenever you got into the water, you were pushing them out of the way!! I said something at the bar and the response was we get alot of complaints about them! Again this was a nice place, but its all about them and not the customer. I doubt I will stay there again!",0
4,"I think this is better than the Philadelphia location. Nevertheless, Szechuan house in Hamilton, NJ is still the best.",2
5,"Delicious food and attentive, friendly service. Our waitress Jessica and bus person Sarah were fantastic!  They checked on us at just the right moment every single time!",2
4,"Great food and service. However, I recently found out that the tips do not go to the waiters.... Which should say on the menus.",2
5,"I had my daughter's Sweet 16 there last night.  The atmosphere was amazing.  The food was delicious.  We had the Penne Alla Vodka, Chicken Fingers, French Fries (delish), Roast Beef and green beans. Everyone loved the food.  The manager Melissa was extremely attentive.  The Christmas decorations were beautiful.   We had looked at renting a banquet hall in Newtown Square and when I worked out the numbers it would have been $20 per kid and then I would have had to pay for the food and drinks. I highly recommend having an event there.",2
5,"LUKE offers a great breakfast !  A bit on the pricey side for breakfast but definitely worth trying.  The breakfast menu has about 10-12 items and you can see a picture of it above.  We had the Basket of Beignets with chocolate sauce, the Homemade Yogurt, Biscuit Sandwich and Cup of Fruit.  All were great and our waiter Jackson provided excellent service.",2
1,"One of the worst customer service I have ever experienced at any Toyota service center!Twice in the past half year, I have had very poor customer service here. The first time was when I bought my car in specifically asking for an inspection of my right front tire, informing them it had been leaking air a few days ago and I had to pull over to get air pumped in. They found nothing... only 2 days later, that same tire went completely flat. I took my car to a local auto shop, and they found a huge nail stuck in the tire that would've been found if Toyota had done a careful inspection the first time.Second experience was even worse and more shocking. I took my car in for servicing on a Saturday morning. The service person could not answer many of my questions, and when he stated that he was new, I kindly asked him how long he'd been working there (thinking that if he was so new that he didn't know a lot of info, that I'd ask another representative to help me). Out of nowhere, he yelled out in an extremely rude and angry manner,  ""That's none of your business ! ... I won't have you harrassing me..."" Everyone in the room was startled and turned around to see why he was shouting so loudly.  Perhaps he acted this way because there was no manager on duty, however, this behavior is customer service at its worst. As a person in the service industry myself (I am a physician and my patients' health, safety and satisfaction come first), I am shocked by his blatantly inappropriate and unacceptable behavior. This behavior reflects poorly on his company, and I hope nothing like this happens to any other customers in the future. I went to another shop to have my car serviced, where customers would be treated more politely and with respect.",0
5,"Come here for delicious, home style New Orleans cuisine. We went in the afternoon, and although it was full, we were lucky and a table was ready right away. We did the a la carte as opposed to the buffet. It was our favorite meal of the trip!",2
3,"It was good, not great. Good location. Receptionist was very helpful but the hotel didn't have a toothbrush in stock.",1
1,DO NOT shop there! Driver decided to drive off with out fridge- after 4 hours on the phone resolution was a 10% coupon and delivery... In 4 days!!Worst experience ever! Unprofessional and rude! Would never shop there again. Beware!!,0
1,"$28 for two cheesesteaks and a large gravy fries? Cheesesteaks nothing to write home about either.  If your paying that much the steaks should have been the best. Go to Pete's or Lenny's in the neighborhood, you'll pay less but get more. Once this fad dies down the windows will be boarded up, and this place will be another fly by night outfit.",0
1,"This place was disgusting! We used to eat here quite a bit but it sure has gone downhill fast! The place was dirty (garbage cans overflowing, garbage left on tables because the garbage cans couldn't be used). Nothing was filled up (sauce cups, napkins, silverware). The chicken was very dry and couldn't even be cut with the plaatic knife! Well it was good while it lasted but they have seen the last of me!",0
4,Good basic pizza. Good crust. Typical older pizza place environment. Friendly to newbies. Would go there again.,2
2,"Last time we were here the service was great, so on a rainy Thursday we thought P. F. Changs would be a treat. We sat for ten minutes without acknowledgement and were finally greeted by the frantic manager. He brought us waters and promised a server would be over immediately. Another five minutes passed before our overbearing server arrived. She only had two tables. She tried to offer us more time to look over the menu, which we had practically memorized by then. We put in our dinner orders right away. When she gave us our dishes a few minutes later, she disappeared. We were finished our meals and sitting for 8-10 minutes when she reappeared. By that time, she asked about dessert and tried to go get us a menu but again, we knew we couldn't let her out of our sight without losing her forever. When we placed our orders, we agreed to each other to ask for the check when she dropped the desserts. Of course, she had a runner come to our two top with our desserts. One and a half hours for a dinner/dessert for two (no drinks) in a quiet restaurant is absurd. The food was fine, but not worth the frustration and invisible customer status.",0
5,"Thank you Chef John Besh!  My husband and I stayed at the Hilton hotel on St. Charles. One of my main goals was to find some delicious New Orleans grinds.  I was starving when we arrived and didn't want to do any research on Yelp for a place to eat.  Thank God Luke was connected to our hotel!!!  We ended up eating here 3 times over 5 days.  It's usually full of business suits, but that doesn't bother me when the food is so good.All the traditional dishes were good, but the huge surprise was the burger.  I was against ordering a burger while I was in New Orleans, because I wanted to try as many local eats as possible... and you can find burgers anywhere.  I overheard this lady raving about how delicious her burger was, so I had to order it the next time we ate there.  She was absolutely right!  It was one of the best burgers I've ever had!  It was huge, juicy, and packed with flavor.  I also highly recommend getting their bread pudding a la mode.  It was mouth-watering good and straight out the oven!",2
5,"The best Sicilian pizza around! Delicious shrimp, chicken Caesar salads. We will be back. Great service, almost a little too attentive. We were interrupted quite frequently while trying to eat.",2
5,"yeah. chill place, cool locals. get waterfall shots and feed them to the hey-heys. ohh jeejous",2
5,"Companion is one of the best lunch spots in Clayton.  The menu is salads, sandwiches and soups.  If you get there on the earlier side you may be able to grab some of their delicious baked eggs or oatmeal.  I actually worked at companion back in 2001... What a change it has gone through, but the food is still just as yummy.  My salad rotation goes between the Picnic Basket and the Go Green... But all of the salads are a good sized portion with lots of goodness in them.  You can't go wrong with any of the salads.  The sandwiches are all also great - my husband loves the Frenchie, I love the Mermaid or the regular chicken salad sandwich or the Fa La La... YUM, the breads are all made in house.I will always love Companion and go for lunch a lot - it's basically every week at this point.",2
1,horrible food! waited for my nachos that took forever!!!! when they came they were freezing cold even the chips highly disappointed wish i could've given them  no stars they do not deserve any of my stars,0
5,"My grandmother has been going to this place for years, since her mother used to take her...I bought my husband's wedding band here, they sized it quickly and brought it out to my car so I didn't have to pay the meter in downtown Tampa.Great service, great prices, great history. Fantastic shop!",2
4,"Super fun!  My girls and I love smoking hookah and hearing good music, so this place is one of our favs!",2
5,"The food at this location was amazing. I throughly enjoyed the food and service provided by Ciara (I couldn't find my receipt, so I'm not sure if the spelling is correct). However, Ciara was pleasant, responsive, quick, and knowledgeable about the menu and the surrounding areas. I would definitely visit this location again!  P.S. the jalapeño cornbread was delicious.",2
4,"I stayed here 3 nights for a work conference. Work covered a regular Peppermill tower long and I upgraded to a Tuscany king, but they were sold out of those and gave me a double king in Tuscany tower. That was fine with me, although the hotel appeared far from packed with people. The room was non-smoking and no hint of smoke smell. The bed was comfortable, the room bed and room and bathroom were all clean and orderly. The pillows were enormous and therefore a bit uncomfortable for me, would be nice to have 2 normal pillows and 2 big pillows per bed instead of all big pillows.The room was decorated nicely, but the carpet was a bit obnoxious or overly ornate. Room had small fridge, safe in fake drawer, great Jacuzzi type soaking tub and nice shower with two heads. Room was cleaned well by the maids each day no matter what time I left.  Pool and hot tubs looked great, but didn't have time to enjoy them. I would recommend the hotel. I have stayed at the Atlantis also, that hotel was nice also.Cons-long hike to Tuscany tower to rest of hotel features. Room AC/heater dried out my nose to point of being raw n bloody.",2
5,"i was here a long time ago when we were camping at Carpinteria State beach but it's been some time and couldn't recall how the food was.  We stopped by for lunch,  got here early around 11:15, good thing because the place was packed by 11:45. We started off with chicken sate.  The chicken was full of flavor and the peanut sauce was delicious. The lunch specials were priced fairly at $8.99 and the portions were large. I had the spicy fried noodle, my one daughter had the cashew nut chicken, my other daughter had the pad prik tia dam with shrimp and my wife had the prik king. All the dishes had a lot of flaver and were each unique. Presentation was very nice as well.The inside of the restaurant is small but quaint.  They also have a nice patio area.",2
5,Amazing shoe store with hand picked selection.  Find shoes you wouldn't find elsewhere.  Staff is very helpful.,2
5,Mussels dish is second to none. You will want some extra bread to dip into  that sauce. Burgers are amazing.Draft beer list is legit. Breakfast is unreal. Egg sandwiches are ridiculous and the pancakes are in a league if their own.,2
5,"This was my favorite breakfast so far.. In Nashville from NYC with husband and 2 children.. From the moment we walked in everyone was so nice and friendly. We had eggs and biscuits.. delicious!My son orders waffles and the other french toast , by when he saw how good the waffles were and wanted to switch they did with no problem.  Highly recommended!",2
5,"Wow ... impressed. Super yummy food with huge portions. Homemade Tater Tots and great pickles. Pulled pork has a thicker smoke flavor, but good. Grits had great texture, well made. Everything was fantastic ... come with a huge appetite. I ate maybe 1/3 of my lunch, but couldn't take it as we are bar hopping. I told the server I cut it in 1/2 and to eat it. LolVery cool establishment... great music !",2
4,"My family and friends came here last night for a little birthday party. The back restaurant was a tight squeeze, but made us all closer. The kids foods were huge portions compared to usual kids menu's. I got the Shrimp Fra Diablo, and as much as I don't want to say it, the food was uncomfortably spicy. A few people had a noodle or two to try and their lips, tongues and gums were on fire! I'm not sure if it's purposely that spicy or someone accidently spilled the chili oil into it. I took it home with me because for $19 I was NOT wasting it. I put some ricotta cheese in it (I did not have sour cream or lemon)and I still could barely eat it. Such a shame, it came out looking beautifully and the shrimp were huge and had the tail on (which I love, holds the flavor). The staff was quick and friendly. We will definitely be back, I just will not order the Shrimp Fra Diablo.",2
4,"I was excited to learn that an Indian restaurant which delivers had opened in the area, and Nirvana Fusion did not disappoint. I was extremely pleased with the variety of options on the menu, the service, and the quality of food. Our order arrived promptly and everything was warm, fresh and absolutely delicious. The butter chicken and naan were particular favorites. We're looking forward to ordering again soon and trying some of the other dishes.",2
5,"The best grits in Nola + consistently good breakfast/brunch + pleasant staff and service. This is a go-to when I want a good brunch without a crazy long wait or reservation needed. It's a small location so there is an occasional wait, but the staff is great at turning tables and only accepting food orders as space becomes available for seating. I usually take visitors here when they want something casual but delicious. Definitely a good spot that locals frequent!",2
5,Another great visit to Glory Days. As usual the food and service were awesome. Ask for Parker and you'll be guaranteed good service!,2
5,This was by far my favorite Cuban sandwich of all the Cubans I've had to date. We were treated to a free coffee after the meal as well as a spin of the wheel which led to a free dessert. Over all the experience was excellent.  I can't wait to go there again.,2
3,Nice place to eat Mexican food! Friendly people and large menu. I have had steak burritos and stuffed pepper... the hot slasa at the beginning is very tasty...,1
5,"This place deserves a special mention.. it's not really on the heart of the city (for tourists), but it's definitely a place you should mark down for one brunch at least...shrimp n grits are hands down the best we've had in the city....the juices were fresh... and for a person who has a hard time eating Omelettes, Surrey's has converted me for sure.. the lump crab omelette with the sauce was just the cure for a dull grey rainy morning...! Word of caution-the place is always full, so make sure you get there at least 30 mins before you really want to eat, just to make sure you don't starve over the delish smells that keep on wafting out",2
5,Awesome tacos. Great salsas. Delicious Margaritas! Happy hour 3-7pm. Friendly and attentive staff. Ask for a swirl of Mexican vanilla in you're iced tea. It's like my Abuela is in the back cooking this stuff!,2
5,"I was quite reluctant to try the Montecito Wine Bistro, but I had an Axxess deal...  Wow, have they been wronged by Yelp!   I was more than impressed!!!The place is very nice, we sat by the fire and it was cozy and quite beautiful.   We ordered a salad to share, We had a beer and two entrees.   I had the Beef Bourgogne and my wife had the spare ribs.  Both were absolutely excellent!!!   I think that the salad was $8 and each of our entrees were about $22 or $24, they have a few less expensive items on their menu.   The highest price is $30 for the 10 ounce NY steak.   I might add that our meals were very generous and we had leftovers!  Service couldn't have been any better, our waiter checked on us a few times and the manager came by at least twice!  He was nice, from the old Piatti's which used to be in this location.  We talked about Yelp and I assured him that I would be giving him a great review... in part to right the wrong of all of this restaurants early reviews that still dog their overall Yelp rating.   I encouraged him to create a good Yelp check in deal... I hope that he does. If you are looking at Yelp to pick a great place to eat, please focus on the more recent reviews and you might just want to give them a try, it is really VERY, VERY good!Added:   I just read their reviews.   So many of the one-star reviews are by people who have written only a single review for this restaurant!  Very suspicious!  It looks like someone has it out for this place.   I am surprised Yelp has not filtered them a little better.... they are usually so good at that!   If you see reviews that look insincere or questionable, hit the flag button!",2
4,"Brick House is one of my favorite spots in Tampa. I love sitting in the outdoor patio (with the comfy high top chairs and outdoor fire pit), although indoors (with it's huge fireplace, leather couches as seats and cozy nooks) is pretty great too. Great selection of foods and beer. Try the pretzels for an app, Yardbird sandwich for dinner (or the Salmon, or the chicken fried steak!), and for dessert, you can't go wrong with the cupcakes. Everyone who works here is extremely nice, and smoking is allowed on the patio.",2
5,This place is excellent. Best damn daiquiri I've had - and I'm not a rum fan usually and have a fiancé who is quite a cocktail maestro. Service is excellent and everyone was super pleasant. The staff were incredibly friendly and this was one of the warmest places I've been; unique from the other cocktail bars in hipster east nasty.,2
5,"Great food, great drinks and Vann was one off THE BEST WAITERS we have EVER had!!! We will be back again. Go there for some Food and Drinks and ask for Vann.",2
5,"Pleasantly surprised.  Pick your pizza size, pick your toppings as you walk down the line and make your personal perfect combo!   They have specialty pizzas already designed too.  Cookies are the best we ever had served warm!   Very cool concept.  They have salads and sandwiches too. Definitely would stop back.",2
5,"I had no idea pudding could be this good! I went here late in the day hoping to score a cupcake (or two), but they were all out. Which turned out to be a boon because I probably would have overlooked the pudding otherwise. We were offered samples of banana pudding, peanut butter pudding, and strawberry banana pudding, each as delicious as the last. This stuff is like the Häagen-Dazs of pudding: rich, creamy, and indulgent. In fact, it's closer to eating custard-y ice cream than any pudding you've ever had. We'll definitely be back for more since the two containers we took home with us are sadly already gone.",2
5,"Wow ! Surprising combinations of delicious flavors. Ordered the Punjabi after being told ""there's really no way to describe it"", but it was amazing !The guy working seemed like he was doing a great job, but that he needed more support for how busy it was. Hope he gets it !",2
5,"Everything here is perfect! We go to Ralph's for every special occasion. The ambience is magnificent with the dreamy oaks trees lined up on City Park for an outside view. The service is always five star.  But the food, the reason for going in the first place is what should and does stand out. Here the food is truly memorable. The short ribs appetizer alone is worth going back for again and again. Oh and the chocolate doberge cake is perfection. They have delicious special drinks each month that proceed a charity, giving you a reason to drink if you ever needed one. Ralph's is definitely a special place.",2
4,"Well... Size isn't everything.  I ordered the grill is on fire veggie burger.  I was practically starving.  When it arrived my first thought was ""oh dear, I'm going to have to order two.""  The veggie patty is tasty.  The texture is a little on the homogenous side but Il not off-putting.  I was pleasantly surprised that my burger plus sharing a larger order of fries made me full!  The sauces for the fries were interesting.  I enjoyed the sweet hot mustard.  A good bloody Mary was my adult beverage of choice.  The drink was well balanced and came with a swizzle of Sriracha sauce on a spear of olives and citrus.  Service was great.  Shakes looked really good, but I refrained from indulging.  I'd definitely recommend a stop here if you're in downtown STL.",2
5,I LOVE this place and the people who run it. My favorite is their lamb: the kabob and the shank. I've brought some of my friends here to try the food and they've enjoyed it as well. *Don't forget to sprinkle some sumac on your meat order. It's the reddish brown colored stuff in the over sized pepper shaker at the tables*,2
2,"Torn between a 2 and a 3, and I'm so sad about it!  The first time I went here I had the Ziggy burger and it wasn't bad, but was so messy that it just fell apart everywhere.  I probably would have given it a 3.  The fries are good, but not mind-blowing as some people have described them.Tonight, I read a ton of great reviews about the Philly Steak, so I was happy to try it.  Somehow, on the 3-block walk home, the sandwich became extremely soggy.  Not just regular messy-sandwich soggy, but so soggy that I couldn't actually pick it up.  I had to eat it with a fork.  The tomatoes and lettuce had already become warm, too.  The mushrooms and mock meat were pretty good, but for some odd reason, there was a ton of ketchup on everything.  It took away from the other flavors.  Lastly, the prices posted on here are not updated.  The meal was over $15 (something like $9.25 for the sandwich and $4 something for the fries).I'll try it again and get another dish on the menu, but I was so sad about tonight's experience.",0
5,"Due to its being under new management since the last time I was here I was anxious to see if the magic would remain. Alas, the Kabob House is still one of my favorite places to eat in Boise. The simplicity of the kabob entree's constantly reminds me that simple and elegant wins the day. The meat is always seasoned and cooked to perfection. I could eat/drink a gallon of the mint chutney. The basmati side gracefully complements the kabob. A serving of baklava (with cardamom) for dessert rounds out the experience. I am glad the magic persists.Addendum: I wish the entree still came with the kabob, rice and the salad with the lemony dressing.",2
5,"This is the closest grocery store to my home.  The employees are very friendly.  I have never had any issues.  Last night, the cashier actually inspected the bag of spinach, saw that it was wilted, and sent the bagger back to get another bag.Great customer service.",2
4,"What a pleasant surprise! We actually saw this place last time we went to reno but decided to not eat here.I'm glad we did this time! The waitress was really nice and accomodating.We tried SOOO MANY things, some things were pretty cheap so we thought it was a small portion but its actually pretty big.the taiwanese burger is actually like a bao...a pork belly bao was what we had and it was good, but this one was expensive, $4 or so. but yummybeef pancake- yummyfree hot sour soup- was okayjaja myun - i think thats what it was , it was alrightminced pork over rice- ordered two of these, huge, good, sweet. had lots of leftovermongolian beef- goodchow fun- MEHveggies- okayred bean shaved ice- yummy, but normaloverall really satisfying and good. used the yelp deal and total for 5 ppl with lots of food was $60 or so.nice nice, we'll definitely be back!",2
2,"Let me start this off by saying that I've been here in the past and had a very pleasant experience. Not this time, though, and I'll come to why shortly.First of all, it was probably slightly busier than normal due to the Winter Classic.  Okay, I get that. But this entire visit was completely fumbled by the staff here, and I was ready to leave almost as soon as we sat down.No one came by to take our drink order. We sat in the direct path of every server in the place (the kitchen entrance was literally one table behind us, so they constantly whizzed by us as breakneck speed), yet waited over 10 minutes just for a Coke and a beer sampler. For the appetizer, we ordered the pale ale beer bread, which came with a blue cheese cream cheese and bacon jam. YUM. My only complaint is that the bread was totally soaked in grease. The cream cheese kinda slid off, but whatever. I made it work. The beer sampler was great, too. We tried a variety of stouts, ales and ciders. My wife loved the double bean ale, and their coffee stout is always on point. For 5 small beers for $10, that's pretty much a steal.The food, though...I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with potato wedges. Notice that I said wedges, as in plural? Well, I got five. FIVE WEDGES. And one was so big, I held it in my hand and pretended to be on Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  The sandwich was so cold, I didn't even eat it, and the fries were hotter than the surface of the sun. I took the sandwich home, hoping to heat it up later.My wife got the apple and bacon pizza, if you could call it that. She asked for blue cheese on the side, not knowing that it wouldn't come with cheese otherwise. You know, like a normal pizza. And it didn't have some apple, it had, like, a whole apple. Like giant slices over a measly amount of bacon. It was sad, and it made me sad. I got my Coke refilled ONCE and that's only because Mary pulled a staff member aside to ask her for it. I felt bad because it wasn't her table, but our server was nowhere to be seen. My hopes were high, but Schlaflys dashed them. I was planning on taking a dessert home, too, which makes me angriest of all!",0
3,"Maybe I'll write an updated review bc I really want to try it again but from hearing other people talk about this place, I wasn't that impressed. I got the creole strawberry which tasted like vanilla ice cream with some strawberries (which didn't even taste ""in season""). I should have tried some of their other flavors. Maybe next time.",1
1,"Availability on a Friday/Saturday night is about the only thing this restaurant has going for it. 15 minutes to take our drink order, another hour until your food arrives (2 of which were kids meals). Broccoli was soggy, premium side spinach was rotten.  Bruschetta topped tilapia had only 8 small pieces of diced tomato on it. Salad bar was pretty much empty. We've been to this location 4 times in the past year and have consistently left disappointed. Unless they drastically turn things around, we'll never go back.",0
5,Excellent little old school bakery. Maybe the best coffee cake (aka crumble cake) I've ever had...well worth the $6 (served at least 6 people).,2
4,"I loves me some TJ's!!! Just an overall comment I'm sure everyone knows, don't fall in love with any product you buy at a TJ's, because they may discontinue it without warning. This location has the same great friendly service I've come to enjoy from all TJ's. And the food's good too!BEER!",2
5,I've been a customer for well over 30 years now. This is a great place to enjoy live entertainment along with beautiful views and of course very good food. Stop by this location at sunset and see what I mean. I'm sure you will enjoy as much as we have over many years.,2
4,"I love ""sample"" stores, like a lot.  Maybe too much.  UAL, well, I like them, and their staff.  I tend to buy something everytime I have been in BUT it usually runs in the accessory category.  One time they had metallic green clutches on sale for $5.  I bought 4 of them as gifts.  (Turkey coma, can't type anymore.)Shortest 4 star review ever......",2
1,"I wanted to really like this place, but it was very underwhelming. The service was very slow. It took 15 minutes to get a cup of black coffee. When I asked for a refill, they said ""Yes, but it is 75 cents."" You spend $3 dollars on a small cup of coffee without a refill??? I ordered the sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit with home fries. The sausage had no flavor and the food was not warm.",0
4,"I ordered from Royal Chef through BeyondMenu, and am very impressed.  I had a few special requests (fried rice made with brown rice, all my food cooked in very very little oil, extra veggies)...and the food is PERFECT.  I mean, it is EXACTLY what I ordered.  The overall flavor of the food is fairly mainline as far as Chinese goes, the delivery time was within five minutes of their estimate, and I got a good amount of food.  Combine that with their perfect execution of my special orders, and it's safe to say I'll be ordering from here again!",2
4,"Atmosphere was great, but the owners had their kids in the front who were rather loud. Food was perfect apart from the rice which had a very weird minced meat. Service was prompt.",2
4,"Convivio is a new Italian restaurant that is located on the corner of 116th and SpringMill Rd in the out lots by Market District. It's a nice dining option if you don't want to go downtown Indy or struggle with street parking in Zionsville or downtown Carmel.  The atmosphere is family friendly, with ample space between tables.  The hostess was very kind to switch our table to accommodate a stroller.  Pasta dishes are a generous portion! Loved the pancetta wrapped breadsticks with burata cheese.  Nice selection of authentic Italian desserts. We can only speak for the wild berry gelato which was a nice finish to a excellent pasta meal. The presentation of the wine list was unique-showing a map of Italy with the different regions and the wine selection.  Also, a good number of choices for wine by the glass.  A couple of small suggestions, one-some of us eat pasta with the assistance of a large spoon-our waiter didn't quite understand my request and brought a small one.  Second, most of us like parmesan on our pasta, so please come prepared to offer it.  Finally the legs on the chairs in the small dining room are extremely slippery and did present an awkward experience when adjusting our seats.",2
3,"The ambiance at the Frontier Steak house is that of 70's era crap. An ugly red floor personifies the facelift this restaurant needs. It's bright, it's gaudie with the cliche bull horns, wagon wheels lights and ugly tables. I almost bet myself that the salad dressing for my salad would come in a plastic container, as it did. So clearly ambiance is that of a school house cafeteria, or equivalent to one star.The service, well there was only five people in the restaurant, so it was excellent, plastic containers and all. Are waitress was nice and efficient, she did say a party of fifty was expected.The food: I had the thirty two oz Porterhouse and a sweet potatoe. The porterhouse was a work of grill master art. It was beyond good, cooked to perfection. You won't find that type of steak at any Morton's, Burn's or The Palm. Credit must go to where credit is due, I tip my hat. The sweet potatoe, eeeehhh not so much.Would I go back, yes definaty. Would I take a date, no not a chance. Would I take my wife of I were married, sure. Why, no one to impress. I almost feel like buying the owner a can of paint.",1
3,"I've used this company a number of times. My first review was a 5-star rating and then I changed it to 1-star because my appointment was a no-call, no-show.After writing a poor review on Yelp, the owner contacted me explaining there had been a family emergency earlier in the week which caused him to miss the scheduled appointment.  Shay is a nice guy, working hard to make a living.  I realize things happen, it seems somewhere in the middle is a better rating.",1
3,"Stopped by for lunch with a group, so didn't get to experience the belly-dancers.  Most in the group ordered the gyros - wihch were decent.  Service was a little slow - possibly because of the large group size.Good ambience, average to better food, slower service.",1
3,It was my first time at this location but they are all pretty well the same. I usually go to a P.F. Chang's about once a year and each year it seems to get a little less impressive. Don't get me wrong the food is good but I am not really sure it's worth the price. We had the sesame chicken and lo mein this time around. The lo mein was really good but the sesame chicken was ok. I can get equal quality lo mein at a hole in the wall I know. Again it's not bad and the service was good.,1
5,"What a find! Great food, reasonable prices and great atmosphere. I had the fish tacos, though I wish I would have ordered the shrimp one's after I took a bite of my husband's. I got a side order of the battered green beans. They were suppose to be spicy, but I was told they didn't make them spicy that particular day. Well, okay then. I ordered them anyways and I was so glad that I wasn't deterred by the fact that they weren't spicy because they were the most lightly battered, perfectly crunchy, and delicious green beans I have ever tasted. To top it off, the beautiful Santa Barbara County day made the outdoor ambiance the most perfect date for my husband and I.",2
5,I'm so glad that someone recommended this place to me! The hummus was off the charts amazing and the chicken dish had beautiful Moroccan spices that you can't find anywhere. The atmosphere and decor made for a really nice and relaxing dinner. Service was top-notch!,2
5,"ONE OF THE BEST FOOD TRUCKS IN PHILADELPHIA!This is coming from a person that doesn't like trying to things, extremely picky, and not very daring... EVERYTHING on their menu is so good and filling! My favorites are veggie burger wrap which is $5 (instead of veggie burger, it'll be in a tortilla, but somehow 10x better) and chicken satay tacos (2 for $7). Their thai bubble tea is extremely tasty too! Beware of the long lines though (try to avoid going anytime from 11:45-12:30, if you do, expect a long wait, and no you cannot call ahead and order). If you're a Drexel student, go in between class, guaranteed no line! CASH ONLY",2
4,"After a long wait, I finally got to check out Livery. The place was nice didn't have to wait too long to be seated. The atmosphere has a nice vibe. This is not a place for dinner it is reminiscent of a tapas place. If you want a place to grab some drinks and not so heavy food this is the place. I went with two other folks we started off with the corn empanada with a spicy ranch sauce and queso empanadas with black bean sauce. I actually liked the corn empanada with the black bean sauce better. The second round we had brussel sprouts, steak empanada, and pork al pastor with a corn cake. The second round was even better than the first. The brussel sprouts and the pastor are a must try. In the end, I will definitely come back to try the rest of the menu.",2
3,This is a popular place to go for us students after exams on Friday. They have an excellent burger selection and the out door patio is now open for business. They have done a great job fixing it up. Live music outside and a decent selection of tap and bottle beers.  Enjoy,1
5,"Seriously. Do not, whatever you do, eat here. If you do you will be forced to enjoy arguably the best Indian on the Main Line. And you will likely overeat. Seriously, I love the Ekta in Fishtown. But this one is better. The dining room is a bit weird (it was probably once an Italian joint). But who cares. Once you taste their Butter Chicken, you wont care about anything other than whats on your fork. Then you won't listen to your stomach when it says you're full. You'll just keep eating and savoring each mouthful of tasty goodness UNTIL YOU EXPLODE!",2
5,I'd like to move in and make this my home. I LOVE this place. There hasn't been one time where I have gone in and they haven't had what I was looking for. Even weird off the wall things. They have something for everyone... all price points and everyone one that works there is super helpful. Yay for booze!,2
5,"While I am NOT a morning person, the new 6AM-7AM morning class (on Tues and Thurs) taught by Roxanne is awesome! She is super spunky and fun at such an early hour. The class is a great way to start the day.I've been to some of the classes as well and they are all good. Highly recommend!",2
5,"Few things are more awe inspiring than water in the desert. It's like seeing life renewed. And it's what makes Sabino Canyon so special. There's lots of different things to do and trails to hike but the best is easily 7 Falls Trail. Which, as the name implies is a series of cascading waterfalls framed by high canyon walls. Found a really good and detailed description of the the hike here: http://www.fuistetravels.com/views/7fallstrail",2
5,"I hurt my back at the gym and was actually pretty worried I really hurt myself but they got me in the next morning and were able to straighten me out. I called around and the pricing, quick service, and location made it an easy choice. Would definitely recommend them to friends and family.",2
5,"I have rented a few units throughout the years & have always had a great experience. The staff is always very helpful & friendly, the facility is always clean, I've never had an issue with security, & the autpoay is helpful & convenient. I mostly deal directly with Stacy & she's awesome! I would highly recommend this place & will continue to do business with this facility.",2
5,"Great place, decent price for rentals. Dudes are always super respectful and amiable and not condescending like some other ranges can be. Military discount. Phil is the man! thanks guys",2
5,"The carnitas (pork) tacos were incredible. So juicy, with such excellent corn tortillas. Additionally, the tres leches cake was delightful. It also wasn't too expensive compared to some upscale restaurants. I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",2
5,"If I could give this place 6 stars I would. Don't let the looks deceive you, great diner food. Biscuits and gravy were incredible. Portions were more than I could eat.",2
5,"Run to this place and get your free shot check in offer!!  Even though it was jam packed with few seats open, it was still easy to find street parking.  There are many tables outside for enjoying the weather and plenty inside for those inclement days.  We tried a hot cinnamon roll and it was gooey and delicious.  The frosting was a bit lemony which really brightened the flavor up.  I was in love with my triple shot latte.  Everything about Coffeebar was charming and delicious.",2
3,This is the cleanest and friendliest Thai on Delmar.  Generous Pad Thai Portions.  Don't get the generic crab rangoon or fried Spring Rolls.  Menu could use a little more attention but all these basics are covered,1
1,"No longer liking china king.  Now that abacus delivers, we no longer get china king.  The food quality is okay.  We had a couple of pretty weak dishes.  Used to like the Hunan chicken and Hunan shrimp.  But last couple of times we ordered, we were disappointed in the quality and flavor.",0
5,"Great spot in the heart of the French Quarter. Do yourself a favor and don't consider ordering anything other than the BBQ shrimp. If you look up the recipe, it's shrimp that's DROWNING in a flavorful butter sauce and, as you'd expect, it's AMAZING. Worth a stop for lunch or dinner when you're in NOLA.",2
5,"Love this place when I don't feel like cooking. Which is like 3 times a month. They are very polite. Really super good pizza. Ordering online is simple and the coupon deals are great. The staff members there are really helpful and the drivers are So Fast. I ordered online, literally 15 minutes later the driver was here. 15 minutes for two large pizzas, delivered several blocks away? And it was mouth burning hot? How'd they do that?!!?!?!!?!?? The only negative is they make me want to not cook more since they are so awesome. Plus it makes my hips even bigger.",2
5,If you haven't been here you are either not from Tucson or you been hiding under a rock! This place has it all! Very excited to find a place for breakfast burros. Viva sucks I stop going there years ago and anything betos sucks with their water down salsas and food. You will find only the best!!! Here. Fresh food salsas and great service! Opens at 6:10 am and closes at a respectable 9pm theses guys work hard. I love your food maico.,2
1,"My acrylic nails are lovely with gel ..without oiling my cuticles..grrr .. bit pricey..  However the pedicure was the worst , very fast and a sloppy foot massage ..",0
3,"We came here a few times and loved it when our baby was still small enough to keep her in the stroller. Now that she is a toddler we were looking forward to bringing her here and having her sit in a high chair and eat with us. Unfortunately, they did not have ANY high chairs and we had to leave. We were really disappointed and very surprised. Bocconcini is a little nicer that a pizza joint, but not nice enough where they should be turning away families with small children. Yelp says they are good for kids. Don't think so.",1
1,"I typically love KFC but my opinion is changing based on increasing cost and poor service.Was interested in trying their new Nashville flavor but was advised that it is only offered in strips, as a 2 piece with one side or a bucket. I wanted it in a 3 piece with two sides and was advised that that was not possible. I guess I won't be able to try it.",0
4,"I went to Marrakesh for my first time Saturday night.  What a cool place! There were many ""likes"" and a few ""dislikes"" to my experience here, which really should deserve 3.5 stars, but I'm rounding up just because of the authenticity of this dining experience. Likes:  The atmosphere inside the restaurant was absolutely amazing.  You really feel like you're inside someone's living room, eating a home cooked meal.  The rooms are well segregated from each other, so each party gets their own private dining experience.  The decor is authentic, with drapes covering all the walls.  The music was fun, the belly dancer was a lot of fun also.  FOOD:  The eggplant in the opening salad dish was probably the best eggplant you will ever eat.  My other favorite course was the lamb, it was so tender and fell right off the shank.  The couscous was also good, and so was the whole roast chicken, which was also some of the most tender fall-off-the bone chicken ever.  Dislikes:  We arrived in a group of 15.  We had to stand outside in the 20 degree weather until all members of our party arrived.  We were outside in the freezing cold at least 15 minutes.  The least they could do is set a heat lamp outside since waiting outside seemed like it happens to everyone.  Once we were seated, it took 10-15 minutes to receive wine classes.  We had about 10 bottles of booze on our tables we brought, and couldn't get glasses after asking 3 different times.  We were wishing we could drink straight from the bottles!  The napkins (whole towels) also took a long time to receive.  When  you eat with your hands, and there's no silverware, you'd think napkins/towels would be the first item they give you once the food arrives.  FOOD:  The beef kbobs were far too over-cooked, hard to chew.  That was the only food that I didn't like the entire night. Overall, the length of my dislikes paragraph is misleading to a 4 star review.  But, like I mentioned overall, the dislikes don't outweigh the overall really cool dining experience here.  I would recommend everyone to try eating here at least once.  It was fun, and very unique.NOTE:  CASH ONLY.  BYOB.  Entire meal was $25/person + tip.  Very good price for lots of food.",2
5,"My wife and I toured with Wine Edventures today, and we can't say enough good things about our experience.  Our tour guide Shawn picked us up exactly when he said he would.  He was extremely informative throughout the tour, telling us about local area history, and showing us from grapevine to bottle exactly how wine is made.  We stopped at four local vineyards and did thorough tastings at each.  We enjoyed many of the offerings and even purchased a few bottles to bring home with us.  Shawn was also extremely patient-he never rushed us at any of our tour stops and really gave us the chance to try different wines and enjoy the beautiful Santa Ynez weather.  Final note on excellent customer service:  Shawn realized that we had left one of the wine bottles we purchased in the rear storage of his van and called me on my cell phone to make arrangements for delivery so that I returned home with every item I had purchased on the tour.  Many thanks, Shawn!If you have any interest in learning more about wine in general or the 110 vineyards in the Santa Ynez Valley, then call Wine Edventures immediately.  This is money well spent.",2
5,"Great restaurant in a hip new hotel, it's naturally not as cheap as a chain restaurant but for a chef-driven restaurant they do a great job of creating well priced food with big flavors by typically not falling back on luxury ingredients in order to keep their food cost fairly low.  The space right off the hotel lobby is a bit strange and there's no great waiting space other than the hotel lobby but overall the decor is upscale & unique in a cool old building and the main recommendation would be to add artwork on the walls.The cocktail list is unique and an excellent complement to the food while there appear to be a number of beers and the wine list by the bottle is great but the glass pours are mostly unexciting and run from $8-12 per glass.  Clearly whoever chose the bottle list knows their stuff so hopefully they'll upgrade the glass pours over time - I'm confident there will be plenty of food & wine people here that would be willing to pay $12-15 for a nice glass of wine to go along with excellent food.Food is naturally the most important thing for most restaurants and Compere Lapin doesn't disappoint.  Our first dishes of Conch Croquettes, Smoked Drum Spread, and Broiled Shrimp in Calabrian Chili Butter were all concepted and executed just about perfectly - just be aware that the shrimp are served head-on in the shell in case you'll have issues with that but they're actually de-veined through the shell which is perfect for me.  In terms of main courses, we went with the Pici Pasta which was good but didn't quite live up to Scarpetta expectations given the slightly less than al dente pasta and small pieces of lobster that got lost in the dish's spice.  The Curried Goat with Plantain Gnocchi was excellent though and I'm sure this will be on the menu forever as a signature dish.Service was excellent (which may have been helped by our early reservation before the restaurant was full) and even the busser was great about removing our plates promptly and being very friendly despite seeming a bit limited on experience.  All around, Compere Lapin seems to be an excellent restaurant which will be around for a while and reminds me in a number of ways of Peche  regarding overall atmosphere, pricing, and food quality.  That's pretty darn good company to keep.",2
5,"Sushi joints around town have been slowly going downhill in my opinion. When I saw that Kei Sushi had some gf options I was in to give it a try! Yummy mussels, TONS of rolls and fun twists on favorites without just adding fake crab (full of gluten btw). I'll continue to be back and share my love of this recently found Reno addition!!",2
4,"Everyone here has always been super helpful and friendly with the exception of the night manager. He's a bit impatient and high-strung. I found his sighs, tone and overall demeanor to be dramatic and unpleasant. I wasn't lingering. I drove away with a couple minutes till close. I hope one day he can find a job more suited to his satisfaction.",2
5,"The pastries were absolutely delicious and worth every penny.  The coffee was decent coffee, although overpriced.  I do like the clean, minimalist design but it was almost TOO minimalist.  The bar style seating at the window is nice.  You get some great natural lighting and can watch the passers on Central Ave.  The staff was very friendly.  Plenty of space in the coffee shop and doesn't feel like an overcrowded starbucks.  I would highly recommend this coffee shop.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I thought the price on the coffee was a bit high.Important edit!:  Bandit coffee got in touch with me regarding my review.  They were appreciative of my response and informed me as to why they charge slightly more for their coffee; their vendors are independent companies, they pay their employees fairly, and a lot of their products that make the coffee and drinks come from local companies or are hand made.  Knowing all of this makes it well worth the extra 50 cents to a buck for a cup of coffee; I'm not just supporting Bandit, I'm supporting other local companies too.  5 stars for bandit.",2
2,"My party of 2 was seated very quickly, however the service was extremely slow especially for a Wednesday night. Server brought us guacamole so we thought it was complimentary, however when the bill came we were charged $8 for it even though we never asked for it. When we asked the server, she said sorry but did not take it off the bill. Overall, the meal was just average but pretty pricey. The mango margarita was not very good and was $8 and the enchiladas were average but were $17. Definitely won't be returning.",0
5,"Service is wonderful. I have celiac disease and have always felt safe here...servers are careful to answer questions and got excited with me about fried chicken. It's so nice to have meals in public beyond a salad, hold the croutons.",2
5,"We had a great time at the pool a few weeks ago.  Dylan, the young man working at the pool, was very attentive to us. He got us towels and searched for 2 empty spots for us!",2

5,"First visit to this insurance approved urgent care. Will definitely return as needed. Entire staff was friendly. Very clean, I really like clean! Felt well attended and very satisfied with treatment plan. Would recommend to the rest of my family.",2
1,"I am currently sitting in a booth with a red face , because this place has made me FURIOUS!  From the moment we came in, things have been rotten. We used call-ahead seating and still waited over 20 minutes to get a table. The apps we ordered came out at rapid speed and tasted fine. Then we waited...and waited...and waited. It was another hour and 15 minutes until we saw our burgers.  I wish  the problems ended there. My Mother's ""well done"" burger came out, still BLEEDING! My turkey burger and my husband's Kobe Beef burger came out ice cold. The bacon on mine was fatty and rubbery and my husband's was missing all together.  We had to send back two out of three, along with my bacon to be re-cooked. This also took forever.  The fries were cold and greasy. When it was all said and done (over an hour and a half after we were seated) we ended up with mediocre burgers. The manager did an underwhelming job when it came to her ""appology""... More like excuses! This was our first and will be our last time at this restaurant. In our opinion, it was not another day in ""paradise""!",0
5,"This is an absolute MUST visit.Everything about this place is damn near phenomenal.The food is fresh and clean; you can tell it hasn't been frozen or sitting in a fridge.The service is great! All of the employee's there are friendly and helpful (I can barely pronounce ""perform"" correctly).They have a lot of Gluten-free and Vegetarian options, which is nice.",2
5,"Went here for dinner on opening day and was SO HAPPY I DID!! Great atmosphere, lovely staff, and food on fleek!! Green tea (PHO PHREE) was so satisfying, summer rolls and spicy peanut sauce were DELISH, and pho was PHONOMENAL! Definitely making this one of my regular hot spotz as I eat my way through Fairmount!",2
5,"Good quality ingredients! Poke bowl was a huge portion.After some questionable poke in Montreal this week, I was starting to get worried that good poke was only a West Coast thing. Fortunately, I was wrong. This was not exactly a traditional poke bowl (kind of a lot of carrots and corn), but the ingredients were fresh and high-quality, and the portion size was very generous. I think their $16 poke bowl was literally twice as large as a $13 poke bowl would be in Seattle, and these are airport prices!Service was not super speedy, especially since I was there in the early afternoon when there was a staff changeover, and it seemed like they usually have fewer customers at that time of day but today it was pretty busy. If you're in a hurry, you can order anything off the menu to go (or there are premade sushi containers in a fridge, whose quality I can't vouch for).",2
4,Good beers and decent food.  Good spot for catching a drink with friends although it might get pricey compared to other options in the area.  Can get crowded after work so watch out for the yuppies.,2
5,"Love this place! The turkey, beans, and biscuits are amazing. Have had better pecan pie but that won't stop me from coming back :)",2
4,"Food is quite tasty, I was skeptical because it's a chaotic mess in there with some sort of assembly line to get your food, however much of it gets pieced together at the register.",2
4,"If you want an amazing view of the city in a great ambience, this is your place. As a Philly local, I bring all my friends from out of town here...for drinks. The food is good, but nothing special. Not a foodie paradise, but you should definitely come here for a drink to see the views.",2
4,"Great hotel if you're staying in Philadelphia and want a hotel in the center of the action. This Doubletree is in city center and if you stay on one of the top floors, it's a great view of City Hall and the historic buildings of the city. It's also an easy walk to tons of restaurants, bars, and shopping. The hotel rooms are clean and big, but my favorite part of any Doubletree Hotel is the free chocolate chip cookie they give you when you check in (The secret is that they give you one any time you ask so I had 5 during my one night stay). So amazing! The staff here are also very helpful. Warning: Parking can be pricey here, but the cheapest option we found within walking distance was Latimer Garage.",2
5,"Delicious, fresh, and friendly volunteers. Yesterday was my second trip to Hollygrove farmers market. The produce is fresh and organic. The volunteers were nice and helpful. Their tomatoes and curly kale is delicious. Oh and the cucumbers were yummy, big, and crisply fresh. I also purchased zucchini and fairytale eggplant, anhich I haven't tasted yet",2
4,Very cute and chic lounge bar in downtown St. Pete with several beers on tap and bottled and a menu of gastropub and upscale bar food. A little pricey for bar food but delicious and service was great! Definitely recommend the Breckinridge maple brown ale and the shrimp po boy!,2
4,"Both my friend and I ordered taco platters for dinner. He had crunchy tacos with beef and I had the corn taco with chicken. The platters come with 3 tacos at dinner (2 at lunch), refried beans and rice and sauces and everything was good. Service was efficient and the waiter was very pleasant. I think the entire bill came to under $25 so you really can't beat it. They also do take out if you don't want to eat in. Just be ready for that crazy decor of all primary colors and a lot of it. Good for a quick bite if you're in the Frazer-Malvern area.",2
3,"Well, Chatham Tap is about as inoffensive as a bar can be. It doesn't overwhelm you with the TeeVees like a lot of sports bars (there's just one giant screen behind the bar). The atmosphere is cozy but there's still decent seating, the staff is friendly and the menu is even a little out there for pub food--gouda melted over apples on ciabatta? Hmm.... I had an apple, candied walnut and feta salad. Don't be fooled by the fact that it's called ""salad""--it was more like dessert. They could lay off the candied walnuts and raspberry dressing a bit and this would be a lot better and healthier option. I tried my companion's pesto and mushroom sandwich and it was quite good (probably not healthy either). The thick spicy chips were yummy (possibly homemade?). I guess most people don't go to bars to get healthful food, but I sometimes like to mitigate the beer calories by choosing the less fatty-sounding pub fare. I think Old Point may be a better option for those situations.And, regarding beer.... I drank London Pride, which was decent. I'm not really wowed by places that have Boddington's and Fat Tire on tap--these are mass-produced and -distributed beer, people! That said, it's better than Bud or Coors. Overall, Chatham is a decent bar. I can see why some might be more smitten than I was--it manages to offer a bit more than your generic pub experience and that can go a long way in Indy. If you're a football (soccer) fan you might also give this place extra points. But for me there wasn't really anything special to grab on to.",1
4,"Great place to go out and have a couple beers.  It's loud and usually packed with people during any sport event.  The fries are absolutely epic and totally deserve a try.    Only thing is that on a friday/saturday night it can be pretty tough to get a drink, but really, what can you expect?",2
5,"This is my first ever yelp review, because I thought that Albert's was so fantastic and deserves the good review and hopefully future business. I rented a 14-passenger van to take us from Mt. Laurel to Philly and back for a bachelorette party. The price was the most affordable we found. The staff were always quick to get back to me and flexible when we needed to change our pick-up time. Our driver, Jay, showed up on time, was patient with us throughout the night as we bounced around to different places, and so incredibly friendly. We couldn't have been happier! Definitely go with Albert's.",2
5,"Brilliant Japanese restaurant. Simple black and white decoration with comfortable seating. They offer a 7 course traditional Japanese menu for a very reasonable price (USD85) given the quality. We had such delicacies as king crab, oysters, sweat water and salt water eels, octopus and different types of fish for the sashimi and sushi courses. Service is excellent - as you would expect in Japan itself. Highly recommendable.",2

The service has always been terrific and timely. What more can I say! I look forward to enjoying many more Plate dining experiences!",2
4,"Edgehill Cafe is located on Edgehill between Music a Row and 12 South, in a quaint little area called Edgehill Village. They have a wide variety of hot and cold drinks that you order at the counter and receive at a separate window. I'm not sure how they get the order from the counter to the window, but I suspect they use either paper, digital transmission, or they turn around and tell the barista what to prepare and I've missed it every time, because I'm trying to figure out how much you're supposed to tip on a $2.48 coffee. Their prices lean on the side of pretentious for a coffee shop, but I do like going there and it's very conveniently located between where I live and work. The staff is nice. I can usually find a table. They have a really cool round table in the corner that people must camp out to get in the morning, because seriously there's always someone sitting there. It's always a girl like stressing out about a final she should have been more prepared for, too. I had breakfast there once. I found it to be worthy of them having a menu, whereas some coffee shops make the food more of an add on and less of a specialty. I enjoy their small plates, like the cucumber, goat cheese, and honey plate, because who can even get through the day without a healthy little treat like that. And that's what it boils down to. We all need a little treat sometime. When it's 3 PM and you know you can't lift another finger until you get a little treat in your system. You deserve it!",2
3,"More Than Just Ice Cream....I walked in the door hungry as all hell, ready to rock out. I started off with an order of hummus...which never came.  My lady friend ordered a bowl of the turkey chili...and I am glad she went with a bowl versus a cup, because, well...the hummus never came. The turkey chili was quite delicious, and I give it a good recommendation. I elected to go with one of the day's specials...walnut-encrusted chicken with haricot verts and mashed root vegetables. What does that mean exactly? Parsnips instead of potatoes? Parsnips AND potatoes? I am pretty sure there was no yucca involved. LOL I digress. The mashed root veggies was the star of the plate though. The string beans tasted of charred water. The walnut-encrusted chicken was a tasty idea, but the crusting was quite overcooked, again lending a burnt flavor. The chicken came covered in a maple gravy...mild taste of maple, and it was a cream gravy. I was expecting a brown gravy with the maple flavor.The waiter did not bring me a knife and fork, which was his second strike after the missed hummus. I was so hungry I did not care, however. I cleaned my plate thoroughly. On to the ice cream!!! My lady friend and I split a belgian waffle, topped with ice cream. As the man, the choice was left to me to pick the ice cream flavor. I went with cinnamon bun, and it was GREAT. The waffle was hot and freshly cooked perfectly, slightly underdone and soft which favored the ice cream on top. The creamy cinnamon flavor was very decadent, especially because it included multiple globules of cinnamon-sugarized butter.  Wowzers. The service was a little sketchy and I had some issues with my entree, but I would definitely come by and give them another chance. I recommend you do, too!",1
2,"I was expecting greatness and got average. It was an expensive night for average. I would have given them 3 stars for food, 4.5 for beer and 1 for service so that's how I came up with two stars.Food. I ordered the Shitaki and Gouda burger with onion straws. It was lacking in mositness and flavor but it was not awful. What saved this meal were the sweet potato fries. They were killer. What killed it was the fact that the order was wrong and I got the wrong fries. The redemption was I tried the regular fries and they were also amazing. Beer. I chose to do the 1.75 5 ounce samplers versus the larger beers seeing as I was not sure what I would like. First sample was the raspberry cider. Very sweet, nice good flavor. Not something I could drink more than a 5 ounce sampler but would do again. I also had a Pilsner, the name slips me, it was VERY good. I am a beer wimp and I really enjoyed the flavor.Service. YIKES. Terrible, awful bad. Appetizers never came. Beers came sporadically. Order was wrong and server threw the kitchen under the bus. I think the kitchen was not the person taking the order.... Not to mention she had an excuse for everything instead of taking the blame. It was a Sunday so it was not even crowded. Will I go back...for the addicting sweet potato fries and beer, sure.",0
4,"I was SUPER excited to find out a Bubba Gump was opening in Edmonton, I had been to the Anaheim location 6 years ago and couldn't wait to try it again.  The new restaurant is BEAUTIFUL, love the memorabilia and the setting in general.  The staff that we had were fantastic, the reason I'm giving this a 4 star otherwise I'd have to give a 3.  Our table had fish and chips, the Shrimper's Heaven, a shrimp cocktail and a caesar salad.  The Fish and chips were hot but the pieces were very small, it wasn't what we expected.  The shrimp in the Shrimper's Heaven was great but unfortunately the fries were barely warm.  The shrimp in the cocktail were huge, and the salad good, I'd say the cocktail was the best part, although it was $17.  Overall it is a fun restaurant and I'd go again but maybe for a special treat as it was fairly expensive.  I'm still happy Bubba Gump is here!",2
1,"So I went to this location because I had the feeling that this location would not try to get over and be perfectly honest...I went there for a noise in my steering wheel. They told me they didn't find anything wrong. So I picked my car up, noise still there. I pointed it out they put it right up and told me it was my rack pinon  costing around $1,500 -$1,800 dollars with labor, parts, etc. Mind you I just brought my car probably three weeks ago. I said scratch that and took it to the Hyundai dealer and got the car fully inspected. I did not, I repeat did not need a new rack and pinon!!!! It was my coupler or however you spell it in the steer wheel that was worn out. Want to know how much it cost me? $0.00 under warranty. Now if I was naive I would have handed over that money to Pep Boys for no reason. I don't know if they were trying to take advantage because I am a woman but I wasn't for it. I won't be returning because of the misinformation. Nice customer service though! That's not enough.",0
5,Amazing food! Super flavorful with every bite. Definitely coming back here! Highly recommend the platter and butter naan!,2
4,"I visited Iris in the French Quarter. It's a beautiful little place. The host and the waitstaff were attentive and professional. I had pork loin wrapped in bacon, and it was very good. My dessert, which involved salted caramel ice cream, was out of this world. Overall, a sweet night out.",2
1,Stay away from this dealership.  I have wrote about 3 different reviews on their site and I keep giving them one more chance but wont anymore.  My whole family drives Hyundai but constantly they find ways to screw you over.,0
5,It was my first time here. I love the wild boar burger with the duck bacon. OMG! It was so interesting. Duck bacon I never heard of it before. I'll be going back. I also sweet potato fries.,2
4,This is the best priced place for tank tops that I've found besides Forever21. It's cheap and fashion oriented clothing so you get what you pay for. I usually find something that is fun to look at even though I may not buy it and I'm not a teenager or size 0 (perfect for this demographic).,2
5,I stayed here with my sister in law for her 21st birthday. The complimentary breakfast was much better than most hotels I have stayed at. The hotel was very nice and clean. We booked a room with 2 queen beds but received a room with one queen bed and a pull out couch. We made it work but my back really would've been better off on an actual bed versus a springy outdated couch. Besides the sleeping situation we really enjoyed our stay. The Mall is right next door so we took advantage of the beautiful weather and walked over. There are a ton of great restaurants right near the hotel as well as the IMAX movie theater. If your dining in the hotels restaurant I highly recommend the guacamole bacon cheddar grilled cheese. It was hands down the best grilled cheese I've ever had.,2
5,Many places in Philly claim to have the best cheesesteaks in town but this place really does! An there's a bonus to that as well...They have a special everyday of 3 Cheesesteaks for $13. An trust me you will not regret eating there. If cheesesteaks aren't your thing the pizza and pasta are equally wondeful.You an your pals can get a good mow on for dirt cheap.Trust me.,2
5,"There's ice cream and then there is creole creamery ice cream. Made fresh right in the store. It's better than cold stone, baskin robins, or anything else you can buy in a grocery store.",2
5,"Went here for the first time today, and it was AWESOME! Highly recommend, service was wonderful, food was amazing and fresh, all over a good time! Not overly expensive and a great atmosphere!",2
5,"I always eat here when I go down 12S. The best BBQ I have ever had...and in the South that's a bold statement! I love the loaded fries for an appetizer and keep it simple with either Pork or Catfish sandwich. The people working there are friendly and accommodating, and the bartender makes bomb drinks. Edley's can get busy. When they are busy, they are BUSY. No tables, line out the door, sold out of ribs. However, it is worth the wait and there are plenty of delicious things on the menu that are even better than the ribs! The overall ambiance of Edley's is fun, family oriented, and its a great spot for lunch, dinner, or snacks. Awesome place to watch football. I highly recommend Edley's to anyone looking for a cool place to eat in Nashville.",2
4,"My husband and I live 3 blocks away from Ichiban.  2 years back I gave an unfavorable review for ""bleachy"" smelling t-cups and earthy tasting imago.  As of today, they get my nod of approval!  Hurray! We had a great dinner! We had the Cliff Drive Roll:  wonder mix of heat, great flavor and lovely presentation! Fantastic cucumber salad, plus excellent  chicken ton katsu.  Green Tea...as it should be.  Keep up the great food Ichiban!",2
5,"Love it here! Their sips mocha is my go-to. Staff has always been so nice! Absolutely love that they have a drive thru too, helps not to unload my kiddos. Oh and their cakes are amazing too!",2
5,"This little bar within peppermill is prime real estate if you're still awake with all the other night owls. Cozy up to the bar and make sure troy is working. He's friendly enough to ask where you're from and tell you about the week's upcoming specials, even when every seat is full (at 2 a.m.). $1 food specials are killer. Free drinks if you're gambling go really well with dollar prime rib sliders and crispy French fries. Don't go to bed when you're done in the casino. Come here and make it a night!",2
3,"The outside of this Walmart appears to have been renovated, but it's still Walmart. The customer service is usually terrible (there are a few bright spots here and there), but the low prices keep people coming back and back. This location has self check-out, which does help lessen the wait times to check-out when people know how to use the machines properly. Overall, this isn't the worst Walmart in the area (better than the one in Spring Hill).",1
5,really great food. this place is always packed and has very limited seating so be prepared to wait in line. menu is also small but it extremely worth the wait. highly recomend going,2
4,"This place was magnificent!!! Great food, if you order the cheese you get ur waitress to flame it right infront of you with a big ""Opa!"". The muscles were great taste and very fresh, the lamb was amazing great variety of cuts and very well cooked!!! I would recommend this place with my eyes close!.  The only reason why I don't give them a 5 star is because they had no parking or coat rooms.",2
5,"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING. We had the poke (so fresh and delicious) I got the special basil pesto shrimp pasta which was insanely tasty, boyfriend had THE STACK and the pork was super sweet and the slaw on top created exciting flavor profiles! We got the macadamia nut ice cream to finish which was also super good. The owner is also the chef, she came out and introduced herself and personally invited us to the events this weekend! Everything is locally sourced and made from scratch. The portions are correctly sized so if you're looking for a 10lb pile of food to be plopped in front of you, maybe order more than one thing. EVERYTHING IS FANTASTIC.",2
2,"Hrm. I HATE to bad mouth a place which is obviously a small business and in a super competitive market. But this order was .... problematic. Listen, they totally got the basics and cheaply too. Pork fried rice, excellent.  Crab Rangoon,  over cooked, but fine. In fact, anything premise and deep fried was exactly as you'd expect.But the award winning Whole Chicken Pad Thai is just one giant green pepper disguised as noodles and nuts. It's not just bell peppers -- it's spicy hot, even though it wasn't marked that way -- and they marked half the menu as spicy.I bought $50 worth of variety and opportunity,  but I'm left wishing I'd stuck to the super boring stuff you can get anywhere.  *sigh*",0
5,"This is not the place for vanilla ice cream with fudge sauce. Go to your grocery's frozen food section for that. Yeah the flavours sound odd to the average ice cream consumer but OMG. you will go in and can proclaim you will die happy after leaving. Try the raspberry white chocolate flan and fried banana. Well, anything is good on the menu. I would know, about 40 of us showed both times I went and the place was already packed. Service was slow but still friendly and definitely well worth the wait!",2
1,"I have been going to this nail salon for years off and on. I came here back when it was called Tropical Nails and Tom was the owner. Now its Grant Nails and has a different owner. When I started getting my nails done again I lucked out and found an experienced technician named Amy. I stuck with her because she did good nails. Then about 2 months ago Amy left. So I let the owner Angela do my nails. The first time was ok. Then the second time she did them the gel polish (which she talked me into getting instead of regular polish) started to chip within a day. I called and complained, she redid the polish and again within one or two days it was chipping. Now my nails look at mess. I don't trust her to correct the problem. Unfortunately, I'm going to have to find a new nail place. Very upsetting and disappointing.",0
1,"Very disappointed :( We came first thing in the morning, but we're rushed through because a group had appointments an HOUR later. The girl didn't clean out my toes, skipped my cuticles, and proceeded to BURN me with her callous sander. For four days I've been walking around with sander induced Blisters and they hurt like heck! She put two coats on my big toe and one on the other toes. The decor is nice, but the staff is unprofessional and need to be trained how to do nails without rushing. You won't get return customers with this level of service.",0
1,Sat at the counter for nearly 15 minutes without anyone acknowledging my existence. Service obviously is lousy. Left without even being offered a menu.,0
5,I have been here a couple of times and they are always friendly and very helpful. The part I picked up today was A LOT cheaper then the dealership and they also installed it for me cheeper then any other place I called.,2
1,"This is my second bad experience in a row at Stefano's. Tonight, I waited over 45 minutes for a call-in order they said would take 15 minutes. Then they were out of Greek dressing and told me they'd ""been out for a while"" - how does a Greek Italian restaurant run out of Greek dressing?",0
5,"Betsy's cupcakes are the best anywhere! There are SO many different flavors & they are FILLED!  She also supports many good causes like Autism! I have always purchased them from the farmers markets, but now there is a great shop! I love the train station location. Thanks, Betsy!",2
1,"I am so angry with myself for having foolishly fallen for their sign-up offer. They made it seem so simple and it was tied to my American Airlines account so I was even offered bonus airline miles as a sign-up incentive. They've been charging me over 19cents kWh for well over two years now. I wasn't even aware that other companies charge between 9 - 10 cents. I'm angry at myself for not canceling much sooner.I just got off the phone with them now to cancel and was told that it ""will take one to two billing cycles for the cancelation to officially go through"" so I will be paying a fortune for some time more. I recall it was instantaneous to START an account with them. Why the difference? Great. Right in the middle of the summer. Stay far away from this company, people.",0
3,"I've been wanting to take my girlfriend out on a romantic date to a good Italian restaurant. I thought I'd give Caruso's on 4th Ave a try.There were three hostesses when we arrived. I told one of them that I would like a booth for two. One of the girls made a strange look on her face that was either confused, annoyed or both. I couldn't tell between the two expressions. One of the hostesses takes us to a table. I told her I had asked for a booth and I thought that was where we were going because she didn't acknowledge a booth wasn't available. That's when I figured out why one of the girls made a strange look.** Just a heads up. Caruso's only takes reservations on large parties. Makes sense. But I still would have liked putting my name down to get a booth **Shortly after we sat down our server came over and introduced himself. Forgot his name. But he was a decent fellow and was very knowledgeable about what was on the menu.I went in the establishment craving a cold beer. The beer menu lacked variety. It didn't entice me. Instead I ended up ordering a regular iced tea. The glass was huge, which is always great!** Keep in mind that it can be a little loud in the restaurant sometimes. **I ended up ordering The Caruso Special, which consisted of a ton of Italian spaghetti specialties. It was delicious! However, I did not feel like I got enough bang for my buck due to the rather small plate size. I wanted more for the $10.75 I put down for my meal.Don't get me wrong... Caruso's is still a good restaurant. But I will be thinking about my other options before I go back.",1
5,"Both my husband and I have been working with EF for over a year to handle our book keeping. It is truly a pleasure working with everyone over at EF. In the short time, I've been woking with EF, I've learned so much. They are incredibly detail orientated, patient, attentive and  great partners for our growing business.",2
5,"This is probably my favorite Italian restaurant in town! The service is good, the food is delicious and fresh, also it's authentic! FYI, it's BYOB. I love the squid salad most, really yummy and the sauce is just perfect, by the way I like sour sauce.",2
5,"This place was by far the best food we had around Tampa. We were very pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere upon walking into the restaurant. The decorations and atmosphere were very fancy, but we still felt comfortable wearing jeans. The service we received was fantastic. Our waiter was able to help us with anything we needed, was very attentive, and had great recommendations. We started with the beef empanadas and chicken empanadas which were some of the best I have ever had. We also got the cheese bread which was delectable and so soft and moist. For my entree, I got their sampler plate which came with the chicken curry, which was out of this world tender and very tasty, the jerk chicken, which was way to spicy for my liking, and the brown stew which was also very good. Other than the spiciness of the jerk chick, which is how it is supposed to be, I have nothing I could even think to complain about this place. By far the most tender and tastiest curry chicken I have had. If I lived anywhere near this place, I would be a regular, and would order the curry chicken everytime.",2
1,This is my 2nd time here. The 1st time was smooth and I didn't wait long but I just realized they didn't use synthetic oil when I thought they did. My vehicle is new to me so I didn't realize the price difference and just checked my receipt since I asked what oil they used for this oil change. Today's visit went horrible . I waited 1 hour and 45 minutes since they did not have my oil filter on hand and my car was already on the lift when they told me this ! They were waiting for it to be delivered but it never came so the manager drove to get it himself. I have to say the manager tried so hard to make things right and was so nice but in the end almost 2hours for a oil change is awful. They also used regular oil again but changed it when I asked. My oil change was discounted because of the inconvenience but I'm done and won't go back !,0
5,Awesome hotel! This place is 2 easy blocks from Bourbon st. It's in an old early 1900's building which gives the room a cool look with brick seen from the outside walls. The room was very clean and sleek. With the nasty of Bourbon st each night it was a great escape! Will stay here if I ever come visit again!,2
5,"Came to this location after the zoo.  The staff is amazing.  Took a little long to get our food, but once we got it, we were so very happy.  I love this location.  More friendly than Metairie.",2
5,"A group of 9 met for lunch August 26. HS friends. We were relegated to a back room with no one around. THAT WAS A GOOD THING. We had our own private room. And we did a lot of laughing and a lot of talking.Trish was our incredible server, and she had another server at her shoulder. He was always smiling. And he helped a lot.I made the reservation, specifying that we needed separate checks and that I was paying for the ""man of celebration's"" meal. I double-clarified both points with Trish. She got it, and she was unfazed. These people have nerves of steel.It went like clockwork. They got in cadence with our program. We were slow, steady and smooth.A lot of salads were ordered and enjoyed.I got a cheeseburger (Cheddar, no bun), double pickles, tomato, lettuce and onion. Southern green beans as a side. I don't know what's so Southern about these green beans. But they were flatter and longer. And bacon was involved. Bingo!An incredibly juicy medium cheeseburger , , , really good. Beef flavor, tender. I want another one.Trish took pictures of our group, which are now on Facebook.I took half my burger home, and I drank 17 glasses of water. Gol, I had to drive home. Come on.",2
4,"I dig totally dig this place!  This place has TONS of custom hand rolls and everyone I've tried was delicious! If you like it raw is their motto, and yes I do like it raw!  Their fresh fish (sashimi) is delicious!  They have great cuts of fish, they have additional items on their menu if you're willing to try something different.  This place is a combo of Japanese and Korean dishes so they provide great options.I normally get take-out here which is always ready when they promise.  My casual go to sushi place.",2
5,They were VERY short of staff yesterday but the waiter was extremely sorry & did the best he could! I recommend this place! The food was hot & I felt like we didn't wait too long. We did wait quite a bit for our drinks. I was disappointed that when our meals came that our appetizer came with it too. Other then a busy day. I recommend this Chedders!,2
5,This is my third allergist in Reno.  This guy is super smart and up on all the latest studies.  He is a great doctor.,2
4,I went to this sprint store location to upgrade my iPhone and was helped by a store associate named Gary. He was so helpful with every question I had regarding my new phone because I am technologically unsavy. Needless to say he was so great I wound up purchasing an ipad mini as well. After I left the store I had some difficulty navigating some things on both devices so I called the store to speak to him more then once lol and he was so gracious in helping me over the phone and so patient with me. I would definitely recommend asking for Gary when you visit this store he was absolutely awesome.,2
3,"Ok,  my initial disappointment has been  somewhat eliviated, but the Opryland Resort is still lacking a world-class resort feel.  Perhaps it's the purpose and theme of the hotel.  There are some really nice amenities,  especially the shopping. The restaurants are somewhat disappointing.  Although many choices,  it kind of feels like different versions of the same choices.  Pricing is a premium,  but food is not. Finally,  I still don't think the resort understands what is necessary to be world-class.  It's not the property,  rooms,  or even the pricing.  It's the lack of that special sense of being taken care of.   As a Marriott/SPG property, benchmark the Phoenician, Camelback  Inn or Desert Ridge in Scottsdale to see how it should be done.",1
5,This is the best tea shop I've been to hands down! The tea and the atmosphere are great and I LOVE the people there. They are all extremely helpful and knowledgeable about their product. I always look forward to trying the new kinds of teas they get in. I'll definitely my go to spot!,2
3,Good for a quick and tasty meal or drink.  Large selection of food that tastes good.  Lots of tv's to watch any and all sporting events.,1
5,"I was a member of the club for years and really loved it. I cancelled my membership because we moved and the location was no longer convenient- I miss this gym. First, there is a track (12 times around is a mile) and I'm not aware of any other gym in the city with a track. The fitness floor is huge, and I never had to wait for a treadmill or other piece of equipment. (I usually was there around 6am, a peak time.) Gym is kept very clean as is the locker room. There is also a beautiful lap pool, although I only used it a couple of times so I can't comment on the wait time for lanes. Also, excellent classes particularly Shoshanna's weight training in the AM as well as spin classes. The bikes aren't as good as Flywheel, but many of the instructors (shoshannah, hannah, jason, and Jamie to name a few) are just as good as Fly if not better. Also, the employees are super sweet- both front desk and membership.",2
5,"First time buyer and immediately impressed with the level of professionalism and customer service from David.I bought 3 bottles of wine to be shipped to a friend and provided the wrong address. After the shipment was delivered, David went out of his way to make things right and shipped to the correct address for me. I am now a Redneck Wine fan! :)",2
1,The worst customer service and nasty employees EVER!!!  SLOW SERVICE!!!Missing items and cashier not giving correct change.  I felt like she wanted my $10.  Manager was no better...nasty and said to call and complain...she did NOT care. NEVER again!!!!,0
5,"Our fantastic server Maria, she was very detailed and recommended things by doing her job helping us and dealing with a customer at the next table that had an appetizer that was too spicy for their taste...very professional.  The young busboy did a great job, too.The pizza was wonderful and the 10"" pizza was enough for the two of us after having had the wonderful date appetizer.  The back outdoor garden was nice and quiet near the outdoor oven.  I given them a 5 because we spoke to the server quite a bit.  I will say there was just a couple of slip-ups (improvements).  The door greeter didn't really do anything except open the door...forgot to say hi or talk to us.  Although, she did tell us thank you for coming upon leaving.  Maria had been speaking to us while doing the check that she forgot to check id as the credit card requested.",2
1,Couldn't have asked for a better location but horrible maid service and not worth the price. Horrible communication between the staff. The room was nice but didn't include a mini fridge or blow drier. The wi-fi was also a problem. It stopped working and when I asked the front desk about it they told me to call a number.... Which I was on hold for too long with. The pool was heated and had a nice view but one night was hot tub hot and the next was luke warm. Wouldn't recommend this hotel.,0
1,Horrible service! They asked us to put the baby carrier on the floor instead of giving us a bigger table. Are you kidding? I felt completely guilty to have suggested the place. Unbelievably lousy service. Never again!,0
5,My boyfriend and I spent New Years Eve at Tzin and it was one of the best experiences we have ever had. The restaurant is small but cozy with the addition of pillows on the booth side of the tables. We were both a little apprehensive about the dinner going into it because the pre-set dinner for New Year's Eve was a little pricey ($140/person for 5 smaller courses and a bottle of wine) but it was worth every penny! The food is out of this world. I'm actually disappointed that it took us this long to eat there. We will for sure be back!,2
2,"crappy restarurant with awful service and rude waiter. if you are looking for a GOOD BYO italian restaurant, go to La Baia on 17th and Lombard!",0
4,"A good red sauce kind of place, third time I have been there and everything was very good, I will say the service is kind of slow due to not enough servers but it was a Thursday night so I will cut them some slack for not being busy and only having one server , but if it was a Friday or Saturday night I would not have been very happy to wait as long as we did for our meals, but everything was very good and will be back,",2
3,"Inexpensive, but needs some improvement.Being one of the cheapest Wyndham hotels in the St. Louis area, I thought I'd give this Super 8 a shot. Checking in was fine, but as soon as I got to the stairwell, I noticed a very musty smell. The second floor hallway wreaked of smoke, even though smoking was supposedly not allowed. The room gave mixed impressions. The bed was nice, but the closest power outlet was literally attached to the wall with a piece of scotch tape. I tried plugging my phone in for a charge and it kept falling out. Checkout was very slow. Usually Wyndham properties allow express checkout, but not here. After waiting for about 15 minutes, the lady at the desk prints my receipt, only to walk away and say she'll be right back. I guess she went to check that the room was left in good enough condition to return the security deposit. Either way, it was one of the slowest checkouts I've ever had. If you're looking for a budget stay and won't mind a few of the issues listed above, then you may be fine staying here for a night.",1
3,"Acme in Flourtown is good for a small local grocery store. It's clean, has a fairly decent layout and selection and the staff is pretty good. If you're looking to grab something quick it's the best option close by. (The Genuardis in Flourtown and Acme in Ft Washington both kinda suck)However, If you're looking to do some heavy, stocking up, grocery shopping you're probably better off heading somewhere else.",1
1,Salad was full of brown wilted iceberg lettuce. The pizza was cold by the time I arrived home (picked it up.) Way too expensive for this awful product.,0
1,"Horrible service. I had an appointment everything was on track, came back an hour and half later (during drop off they said it would be done) to find out they never even started my car. No phone call nothing. An hour and half after a scheduled oil change and your car was never touched. Safe to say they will never get my service.",0
5,"My only hesitation to write this review is that it's almost trendy to review Tria, but the biz shouldn't be punished for it... My mistake is I passed by this place so many times thinking I should stop in, especially since it's packed, but figured the alcohol would be overpriced and food would be an expensive art project, at best. I was wrong. Rarely do you stop at a place like this. I've been twice and both visits were everything I'd want for a nice, casual dining experience. The first time I went we were the only ones outside (it looked like it was going to rain... and it did). The servers offered to reseat us immediately but we actually opted to sit outside and watch the rain. Everything was covered so it wasn't like our server got drenched coming to our table. I had a salmon sandwich, she had a salad and we shared a cheese plate. Everything was portioned and presented very well. The wine and beer they recommend went with the lunch nicely - we had a great time, so we came back a month later. This visit was equally enjoyable. We sat at the sleek bar for a drink before being shown to our table. I feel this spot is the perfect W. Washington Square casual experience coupled with it's nearby neighbor Varga for the rowdier experience.",2
2,"Joe Pesci said it best in Lethal Weapon 2... They **** you in the drive thru (or the take out, in this case).I called ahead about 10 minutes before I got there, ordered a whole chicken with mashed potatoes, slaw and mac and cheese.  They said 35-40 minutes.  Cool, we'll stop and have a drink while we wait.  That's why the 2 stars instead of 1 star.  The Manhattan I got was perfect. P.E.R.F.E.C.T.  the happiness ends there, unfortunately.  After about 50 minutes after I ordered, they advised me they were out of mashed potatoes.  Disappointing but okay, I'll deal.  After about an hour and 20 minutes (so double the stated wait), they finally come out with my box of chicken and such.  The chicken was not hot so I'm not sure why we were waiting so long.  One breast piece was fairly small, the other was a chicken finger smaller than the wing.  Given the size of the wings and drumsticks, the breast from this chicken should have been 8-12 ounces.  Not 2!  The coating was burnt.  Not pleasantly caramelized, just too overdone.  The sides (which are $4.50 each) were paltry.  Like an ounce and a half of brussel sprouts (what we subbed for the potatoes).  The mac and cheese was runny and tasted like raw flour from and undercooked roux.  See the photos.  The picture of the wing is next to the ""breast"".  For $30.  Don't be fooled by the apparent fawning the local press does for a known chef about this place.  It is far from great, far from worth the diamond plated prices.  Except the drinks, that was worth the diamonds.",0
5,"Quick and super friendly. Emily was super helpful with our order. The burgers were cooked just right and our order of fries and onion rings were just the right amount of crisp. Overall, this was a great experience.",2
5,By far the best we experienced in Santa Barbara and it was the only free historic visit. Highly recommend. The view from the tower is beautiful.,2
2,"Food was good.  Waitress was attentive - probably too attentive.  She brought us the wrong check - of course, ours was higher!  Figures!  The main peeve was the opera singer - from his bad toupee to the volume, it was almost comical.  When he did ""Sweet Caroline"" in an operatic style, all we could do was laugh!",0
5,"Best pizza around. You could order anything and it will come out perfect. Everything is made fresh, and the pizza is the best. The calamari is one of our favorite sides, as well as ordering the white pizza. I reccommend this to anyone looking for a delicious meal to eat!",2
5,"I loved it!  We were going to be driving back to Tampa and wanted to stop somewhere for lunch.  I looked for places near the interstate that were highly rated and East Coast Pizza was a match.  There a good amount of indoor and outdoor eating.  I'm so glad that we stopped here because this is exactly how I like New York style pizza.  There are a large number of pies on display that you can get individual slices from.  I always prefer getting a fresh pie out of the over so that's what we did.  The sauce and crust were especially perfect.  I was full after two slices but had half of another one because I didn't want to stop eating.  Someone who I assume was the manager or owner stopped by our table to ensure that we were happy with everything, which I thought was nice.  They have a loyalty program if you are a regular customer.  I live too far away to come here often but I will definitely be back.  Thanks Yelp for another great find!",2
2,"Food was good. I had the buffalo chicken soups, kids loved the grilled cheese and the bread it came on!  Service was not good!  Never offered refills although glasses were empty a long time.  I had to take our glasses over to the bar on the other side for a refill.  We Asked for ketchup several times, I went and asked another table to borrow theirs so the kids could eat their fries.  The lady who brought our food did not say a word just dropped the food on the table and turned around.  Took forever to get the check after asking twice.  The one waitress we saw on the way out said have a good night and she was the nicest person we ran into the entire evening.this is the second time we are been there and I will not be going back.",0
5,I work at Supercuts next to Jeannines and last week a worker from here delivered a box of bundtinis as a promotion and they were absolutely to die for. They were so moist and delicious! Love love loved it,2
5,"Bottomless mimosas, sangrias,  and bloody Mary's for $15 at Sunday Brunch. Expect a wait. The crawfish beignet was delicious... flaky bread stuffed with crawfish and cheese, topped with jalapeño aioli. Yum.",2
2,"Food was good, but overpriced.  Sandwiches came with stale chips.  Although we didn't try any, the beers may be good, but a glass of the house chardonnay which was sweet and simple was $8.  Likewise, mixed drinks were $9 for a small drink.  Our tab for 2 was $85 with tip and included 2 sandwiches and 2 drinks apiece.  Nice atmosphere, but won't be a place we visit often, if we do indeed return.",0
3,"Westfield has noooooo drive thru Starbucks so I was sooo excited to stumble upon this drive thru one close to my house. Look-i love Starbucks...I spend a ton of money at Starbucks. In return, all I ask is decent coffee and friendly service. I know it's gonna be busy. I know I'm gonna wait.... Throw me an apologetic smile or something once in awhile. So when I went over the weekend and waited 20 mins only to get completely dismissed by the barista when I asked for her help in figuring out why I was so waiting for croissants, I was thoroughly disappointed.  When I apologized for interrupting HER and kindly asked if she could help, she offered nothing and said to me ""oh i don't do warming station, my shift supervisor does."" And that was it, you can imagine my frustration.  I hate leaving a bad review but she didn't even yell for someone. Or point to someone. Or anything. Not cool. So when I did find my person, she said the ticket never printed then walked away. Then 30 seconds later came back with a bag of my food. She said it was accidentally left at the drive thru window. The end. It had been sitting there for awhile..and I'd been waiting for 20 mins. Frankly, I want to give a lower star but because I received excellent service from a kid the day before who normally worked at a different store... The Starbucks gets an average.. Do better. It isn't difficult to be cool.",1
4,Cheu is awesome. The brisket matzo ball pho is unreal and the buns are phenomenal. Go here now.,2
2,"I'm very familiar w/ all the Marathons and this is the bleakest star in their dim galaxy! The lighting always seems oddly low, not inviting and cozy, more like ""we're saving electricity"" and want to appear closed. Zero for atmosphere in the evenings... My last time there, after heading in and standing w/ my friend , front and center, waiting to be seated in the 1/4 filled restaurant, we waited easily 10-15 minutes for attention of any kind. The waiters mostly hung out by the bar and in the recesses of the restaurant, slouching and gabbing, w/ not a glance at us obviously waiting....finally, let's call him ""Mr.Hunky"", deigned to come up and and said ""Yo, what's up?"". I thought this was a restaurant, not a singles bar from the 70's?""Mr.Hunky"" had passed us a couple times previously but seemed unable to multitask and  seat us at any of the plentiful open tables, too busy to rush back and hang with his posse....I was amazed and said we were waiting to be seated (duh)....but we decided to exit and eat at Jones round the corner where they welcome diners. I've been previously underwhelmed, overall, by the food here and at other Marathons. The  new menu seems to have carved down portions on practically everything.  The burgers are the safest bet, but you may as well not bother ordering it to taste, because it's never right. They also got rid of the one thing that was superb on their menu; the Salmon Nicoise Salad. That was my only reason for going there....that and the faint hope that ""Mr Hunky"" might suddenly realize his true calling and, possibly, only talent and do a spontaneous table dance, for the very first time truly earning his dollar bills! Sorry that I'll miss the performance, as I won't be going back..",0
5,"What else is there to say about 3 Muses?  Creative, reasonably priced food by one of my local favorites, Chef Dan Esses; fun, laid back atmosphere, clean (not something often said about bars on Frenchmen); great music but not intrusive; really good cocktails and an eclectic , well priced wine list.  Definitely worth checking out!",2
4,Stopped in to beat the morning heat and grab an iced coffee. 10 seconds inside and you could tell this is wear the locals go to meet up and enjoy great coffee and a bite to eat. I can't speak to the food but the coffee was excellent and the service left nothing to want.,2
5,"Hello again yelpers! I just have to delete my last review on Peppermill. We had the chance to give them another try thanks to David Fuller. He graciously offered us the chance to return to change our thoughts. It worked! We got there and Maddie at the front desk was amazing. We were early so we asked if we could check in and she got right on it. Our rooms were clean 2 hours before check in time. She had a great smile and her hospitality was impeccable. Our room was amazing with gorgeous views and unmatched comfort. The spa is wonderful as well, don't skip it when you go! This was also a very busy weekend and they did not falter. Thank you Peppermill and staff for changing my mind. I will surely return and tell my friends and patrons that Peppermill is worth it. One more thumbs up for Maddie thank you so much. Oh she was awesome.",2
5,The staff is very welcoming and the building is pleasant to be in.  The doctors are both highly professional and we have had 2 dogs with them almost for 3 years with great results.,2
5,this place is worth the wait on weekends. the biggest problem with this place is trying to figure out what yummy food to try this time,2
5,"Ever since I started working in the area a little over a year ago I dropped in to The Blue Duck for lunch and it quickly became a favorite. The quack and cheese, duck fries, and anything off the brunch menu on Sunday's are out of this world. Dinner entrees are exceptional all reasonably priced for the quality of food. I've never had a bad experience here. Great service and great atmosphere. I try to make it in for one meal a month and if you've got the time you should too.",2
5,"I took my BMW 528 in for some body work on the trunk and rear quarter panel. Although the estimate was a little higher than others, I was very impressed with the knowledge and professionalism of Jennifer and decided to go with Goldies. The repairs and paint job were outstanding and my car was ready when promised. I'd give the body work an A.I also paid for an interior and exterior detailing for $250. The air vents and dash area look brand new which is amazing since my car is a 1997. The rubber around the sunroof was missed and I learned the window hadn't been opened so there was no opportunity to see what needed to be cleaned there. Chips in the paint were touched up. Jennifer said the wax should last for 30 days which I didn't think was great. I'd give the detailing job a B.",2
5,"On a scale of one to things that are awesome, this place is the bomb. I was drawn in by the promise of the duckfat frenchfries. Took the boy for his birthday and put our name in, had a drink around the corner while we waited and were given seats at the bar after about 45 minutes. We were waited on by Keith, the bartender, who was congenial, knowledgeable about his whiskeys and an all-around cool guy. We started with 3 cape may salts (two for me, one for the boy) and tater tots, both of which made me happy.For dinner, I got Kentucky Fried Quail (stellar, though the succotash was not as exciting as I wanted it to be) and the boy got the 24$ Fois Gras burger, which was incredible. Worth every penny. The duckfat fries were pretty yummy, but not even the best part of the meal. I could've done without the cheese sauce, but as it was on the side I wasn't deterred.I look forward to coming back here, with everyone I know.",2
4,"Absolutely delicious restaurant! Loved our server as well, he was extremely chill. Stupendous Service. Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because it is a tourist-trap place that has astronomically priced meals. You're probably going to get that anywhere in this area of the city though. However, if you're wanting to try any Creole/New Orleans-specific means; they have it here. Great place to go if you're wanting to get a flavor for NOLA!",2
1,"Poor service from the door. Stood at the door for 15 mins, walked in when it was not super busy it was Thursday at 12pm. I'm pregnant and there is no more seating area, which I think was a stupid decision when they reopen so they can flip more tables. Was ignored by 2 staff members who seating 3 people before me. Food was cold the times I come in there. The French toast is horrible. They just good making basic eggs that doesn't take much flavor or time. I get the actual egg not the ready made batter. Over fried meats. Burnt has Browns. Save your money & go to a mom & pop local diner to get more for your money.",0
1,I had gotten a strawberry banana smoothie right before my airplane. I drank almost the whole thing but started to feel my stomach getting uneasy. The next day woke up with food poisoning from this smoothie. Everyone stay away if you don't want to get sick!!,0
5,"Healthy food is a rarity in Nola, and HK does healthy food fast. I live in the campus area and I love the convenience of this place. The menu covers it all really, so whatever I'm in the mood for they usually have it.",2
1,"This place is so scummy. Do not go here. I had an entire purse stolen with car keys, iphones, passport inside and no one working was willing to even look if it was turned in, behind the bar or help me out. They told me ""it happens all the time"". Unfriendly and untrustworthy. Do not waste your time.",0
5,The Hummus Envy was so good! I chose the jalapeño cilantro hummus and the garlic hummus. The servings are huge and the severs are very friendly.,2
3,"I think Japanese food is the type of thing where once you've had the good stuff you're ruined for the lower quality version.  This place is popular and people seem to love it, but to me the sushi is not that great.  The nice thing is the price isn't outrageous, as Japanese food often is.",1
5,"Loved this place, especially the Salmon. Only eaten here at Lunch and not a problem. Going to add this one to my Lunch rotation.Spotless restrooms and the service is top notch.",2
1,The worst nail salon I've ever been to. I got acrylic's and the guy didn't even straighten them out while doing them. Got nail polish over my fingers. He didn't even put nail polish in some area of the nail. Definitely will not be coming back,0
5,"Professional and exceptional customer service provided by Christian Talamini, Paul Naegele and the Turnersville BMW team. Our 328i xdrive lease was coming to an end and we were researching our next vehicle. Christian called to check on our status a month prior to turning in the 328i. We discussed what our expectations were for a possible new lease and he said he'd get back with information. He was in constant contact and we finally agreed verbally on a vehicle and finalized the sale that night. I can't say enough about the positive experience we had with the relaxed , no pressure, personable staff and management at BMW Turnersville. Our Second purchase & We love our 330i xdrive and hope to be a valued customer for a long time.  Nicole/Terry",2
5,Best steaks around!   The atmosphere and service was wonderful.  I would only recommend to go after 8pm due to the limited seating available.   My personal favorite was the 10 .oz filet.,2
5,How can you not like Ted Drewes...I live about a mile away and try not to overindulge. I try to stick with the basic scoop in a cup...I just like the ice cream. Sometimes I get a root beer float if I'm thirstly. Definately the best ice cream anywhere.,2
1,"I constantly go to coffee shops to study and I am obsessed with teas and latte art. I'm a huge fan of savory cafe and I just tried coffee cat for the first time today. I've been to French press countless times with friends and today completely changed my opinion. I've been sitting here for twenty minutes lost in homework planning on being here for way too long to write several essays and order numerous drinks. However I didn't feel like getting one the second I sat down. One of the baristas just came up to me and basically accused me of not getting a drink. Our conversion, ""did we get you a drink"" ""no I haven't ordered one yet"" ""are you going to"" ""yes, in do time"" ""thanks"" Do I have to order one the second I get here?!?! It's not like I look fucking homeless here with my Mac and nice clothes. Actually baffled hahaha I wish I wasn't so pleasant when she spoke with me. What's up with the fact that they don't have green tea matcha powder? Their coffee is good I'll give them that, but maybe they need to weave out some of the rude people who work here. Pitty. I'm a loyal customer.",0
5,"I make it a point to stop in this little diner every time I go to New Orleans. I wish there were places like this in Chicago - the prices, the food, the neighborhood folk make this a truly authentic New Orleans joint. It's also super easy to get to via the streetcar if you're in the area since it's on St. Charles :) That being said - no, don't come here if you wanna be wowed by the decor. This place is delicious, home style New Orleans food served by good New Orleans people and that's it. Go on down the street and pay triple the price for food that would never be up to even 1 compared to the 5 star food they have here.If you need another reason to go other than the food - well, I absolutely love the owners, Nick and Helen (fellow Greeks :) ). Nick's had the restaurant for over 30 years in the family and even worked in the kitchen himself when he first came over from Greece in his 20s. He knows every recipe you can think of and his shrimp and corn chowder.. oh man, it's the best I've ever had. I could go on and on about how lovely this place is  - just go and check it out yourself. I mean, there's a reason it's been around since 1946 right?",2
4,My wife and I have shopped here for years. They have the best available produce all the time - local when available and best source otherwise. We picked up sweet corn today and it was from Georgia. Last time it was California sweet corn because that was all that was available. The main reason we stopped was for Georgia peaches. Mmmm. They also have a small greenhouse and plants throughout the growing season.,2
4,"This is good southern barbecue meets fast food. Excellent pulled pork / beef / turkey barbecue, on a typical fast food bun. By default it comes with mayonaise, cole slaw, and pickles on the burger (so be sure to ask for those to be omitted if you don't like them).I had the pulled pork. It was juicy and tasty. The beef was good, but a bit dry. Service was quite fast, and there is a drive through.Note: No seating available at this location, so this is To-Go only.They have very minimal choice of sides (slaw, baked beans, or potato chips). Not particularly healthy. But still quite tasty.",2
4,"Have only been here once, here is what I thought:-Chicken patty   *Lady at the counter told me these are not homemade but I ordered one anyway to give them a try since it was only $1.85 and I have to tell you it was delicous...glad I did ! Warning though the chicken one is a little spicy and taste slightly of curry but it was perfect to me!! They also carry a veggie or beef one as well.-Oxtail meal   *Oxtail was perfectly cooked, seasoned and a generous portion!!   *Beans & peas were delicious    *Veggies were undercooked and underseasoned for my taste   *Fried Plantains were the best I have ever eaten.If you are looking for a dive type restaurant with authentic Jamaican food then I highly recommend you give Irie Bay a try....I can not wait to go again and try their jerk chicken and pork and the other patties!!!",2
3,"Food is good, but the cafe itself is extremely dirty. I will probably not return unless they clean the place up.",1
1,"We have been to Mr Bs tons of times, unfortunately I will be labeling them as the next great restaurant who fell victim to commercialization. I'm appalled. Worst service I've ever had in a restaurant. The quality of food I will say was exceptional, minus burnt gumbo (southern ppl can tell dude). When we asked to speak to the manager to tell him about the service, complete JOKE! Managment is where it starts. MR Bs owners should be completely embarrassed. We will be spending our money at the other restaurants that haven't sold out to commercial life. Almost ruined our New Orleans trip. Shameful.",0
5,Wonderful experience both times. It can get really busy for dinner but the wait isn't that long. Our lovely waitress gave us free gumbo because we waited a few minutes for her to take our order and man was it good. My favorite has been the crawfish étouffée. But oysters looked awesome too! Can't wait to come back and eat our bread pudding. It was so good that I am reviewing before we are done.,2
5,"It is not too many arenas and stadiums across the world that I land as a five stars.  It really is a lot that has to work in making this happen.  The first but probably most important reason why a stadium or arena gets a five star review is due to accessibility to it.  What I love about Bridgestone Arena is it knocks it out the park with accessibility.  Meaning, you can drive to the nearby garage to park there. You can park for free at Nissan Stadium (formerly known as LP Field)  and walk across the Pedestrian bridge (10 min walk) right to the arena.  And you have the bright lights of Broadway where the arena is on.  So before the game or after the game, you have a surplus of sports bars, live music venues and barbeque joints to check out before, during or around the game.  IT WORKS!  All what I have said is before talking about the arena itself.  I'm sure the concerts here are great.   The hockey games here is a great watch.  Seats are decent but getting in and out, the concourse, the food venues..all good with me.Grade: A++",2
3,"Chicken was great.. Mashed potatoes were bland and a little on the runny side. Portions were really small for the price. Two pieces of chicken, mashed potatoes and an average tasting biscuit for $11.00. Could have gotten more food from Lees.. Granted the chicken wouldn't have been as good but for $11.00 I would have had leftovers.",1
5,"We try to eat somewhere special on our last night of a trip. This was our first visit to New Orleans. We started by looking for a Landry's restaurant since we are club members. When this place popped up we made reservations. We were seated at a table in the bar area. We requested a low top instead of a high top table on the reservation. Don't make this mistake. The high top tables are the ones beside the window that overlooks the river. Our server's name was Erica and she was an absolute delight. She made our dining experience very enjoyable. I started with the Captain's punch which contained rum, banana, peach, and tropical juices. It was very good. The blackened redfish etouffee with creole green beans and dirty rice sounded amazing so that's what I ordered. It was delicious. We had a great last night in NOLA with our special dinner. This will be a must on return trips.",2
3,"Its ok, The parking was difficult to find a spot, and the only taco I really liked was really good with pineapple in it. They employees looked mad and rushed me through the order line I felt like they were just not happy to be there or trying to rush me, I might be going back to visit ohh and the prices weren't that great either. It was 35$ for two of us and the drinks were too sweet to even finish. I tossed mine out.  I might go on Taco Tuesday not too sure because the tacos are 1.99 each but I've seen the lines and they are crazy long",1
3,My girlfriend and I went there for an early lunch on a Sunday morning shortly after they opened up. I instantly noticed the dirty floor and the sticky table. Once we sat down. Then we were given the menus that actually had food pieces on them. I didn't want to gross out my girlfriend so I didn't say anything. Food and service and price were all very good. It's a shame they didn't clean the place otherwise I would have been happy to give them a five-star. I assume that Saturday night was busy and they just didn't clean up.,1
3,"The food here is good, depending on what you get. Love the black beanie quesadini and the california salad, but at this particular madmex the burritos are not the best. I used to go to the one in Oakland, Pittsburgh a lot when I went to school there and the food was actually a lot better. Not sure what happened to this restaurant in particular.",1
5,"Incredible food, and a small ($7) platter is two meals' worth for me.greens, beans and rice, jerk chicken. or fried.",2
5,"I love Simone and her French boutique themed bakery. My mom's birthday cake last year was wonderful. I drop in often for croissants, macaroons and other sweet treats at least once a week. Weekend tea parties are amazing but reservations are needed. They also have additional all age events that occur monthly. It's such a fun, posh, family oriented business. Once you get s cake from here you'll never go to Sam's, Costco or Schnucks ever again.",2
5,"Ray has serviced two of our autos for years and is fair, honest and a great mechanic. He has been a huge help in keeping our old cars running smoothly for a fair price. We now use him exclusively for our Honda and Toyota and could never go back to the many crooked car repair services and dealers that we used to go to. Really honest man.",2
5,Very good! The food was fabulous. We both had the specials-- pork burger for me and New York strip for him.  We will be back.,2
4,"So kudos for Sabrina's and Yelp.  Looking for a nice lunch in Reno, I went to Yelp and punched in some key words to avoid the usual fast food chain joints and up popped Sabrina's.Ok good reviews, interesting pics and menu items.  Off we go.The location is downtown but not smack dab in the casino zone, nice decor, trendy.The menu offers some nice salads and soups.  We both had the bean soup (I highly recommend) and salads; Asian Noodle and South West.  Both salads were well presented, ample in portion, fresh and flavorful.We took the recommendation of our server and had the house made ginger ale.All in all a very pleasant, delicious lunch.  Prepared by nice people, in a trendy setting.",2
5,Great buffet. Even towards the end of the buffet hours the food remains fresh.  Good price.  Good service,2
4,"I walked in here not knowing where I was going or what kind of food they would have to offer, very late around 1am on a Friday night & boy am i glad I did! SO DELICIOUS! I had the Doner Berlin with chicken and added Chickpeas and lettuce to it (along with the cabbage, tomatoes, onions, cilantro, feta & cucumbers that come on the doner already)...IT WAS INCREDIBLE!!! They call this a ""sandwich"" but this is like a gigantic pita only it has a more bread like yet crispy texture. The spicy tzatziki sauce it comes with was so good I had to get more on the side! I can't wait to come back and try something else!",2
5,Everybody loves Randy and he a man's sculptor with his vision.  Be prepared to wait when you walk in but he's worth it.,2
1,"We have been to Tre scallini many times and have recommended it to many friends simply because the food is delicious!  However last night after driving an hour + to get there our reservation for 8 people was lost. We were asked if we were at the right restaurant, why we came if we didn't get a confirmation call...then miraculously our name was found but had been canceled???  Never once an I'm sorry or a let me see what I can do???  After telling the woman she very rude...she told me I was attacking her???  Funny on our way out...the next couple's reservations were lost as well!  Perhaps a new method other than a scibbled piece of scrap paper is needed....needless to say we will not be back!",0
4,"This bar is Awesome, I love the decor,very inviting,old time , Russian. The selection of absinthe will knock your socks off. The bartenders were very friendly, would defiantly come back here again, and sample different drinks, but Ya gotta love Vodka.",2

2,"Needs Work! Start by putting a sign up... Where are we? Where is the restroom? This menu is confusing! The bartender was awesome, very well informed and made great recommendations. We were excited for our food... Great presentation but both of our dishes were bland and lacked flavor... I thought this was mexican! I'd give one star for the food/ restaurant but five to the bar tender... we'll try again in a year.",0
5,"The biggest casino in Tucson. They went thru a remodeling, adding the hotel rooms next door.  Its pretty far out from center Tucson but worth the drive. I never win anything but it's a great place to waste the night away...and your money lol. This is probably the closest thing to Vegas in Tucson. During the summer days they host a pool party with DJ.",2
2,Not so super of a superwalmart. Poor selection in small vegetable section. No deli section.,0

5,"Possibly the best breakfast sandwich EVER.  On a biscuit!  Oh my gosh, it was so good!",2
5,"My wife and I had happy hour here and thoroughly enjoyed it. We got 5 total tapas over a two hour period and were full as we could be. We got the Nashville hot cauliflower (outstanding), roasted duck (outstanding), grilled peaches (outstanding) and the scallops (above average). It got a bit pricey, but these tapas have more substance than a lot of other ones I've had in the past. Wednesday happy hour is half price drinks and $25 bottles of wine.",2
5,"Excellent vibe and energy. At 1pm on a Wednesday, was buzzing with people reading, studying, etc. Friendly service. I had an espresso which was a little sharper than I prefer, but sometimes that's part of the fun with drinking espresso.",2
3,"I'll never give 1 or 2 stars for a restaurant because I don't feel that does any good and it takes a lot to be that bad.I just got home after ordering takeout and I ordered the buffalo grilled chicken wrap. Well it's only grilled chicken minus the buffalo sauce. Not a big deal, but for the life of me, I can't seem to get a to-go order that is right when I leave this place. I blame the cook not doing his or her job and lack of management oversight. I think I've given up on to-go orders here.",1
5,"We went with the simple choice and were not disappointed. Eggs, bacon and buttermilk pancakes. I can't put my finger on exactly what it was that made them so good, but the pancakes were divine! Worth it in our opinion! Even saw a girl from the voice while dining here!",2
4,Fun and entertaining!  Randy was great!  Funny!  Not sure exactly what I expected but it wasn't what I expected. I thought it would have more voodoo involved b/c of the name I guess. I think I expected to be more spooked. For the price it was fun tho.,2
4,"Fried chicken dinner was pretty amazing. The size of the sides was a bit small, but for the most part they were pretty good. What really made me a fan, aside from the chicken, was the bread pudding. It was fantastic! I would definitely try this place for the chicken and bread pudding, what more do you need!",2
5,"Just as many others have stated, I too had a work related gathering here. This was my first time attending and the event had a set menu. Maybe next visit I'll see their actual menu. Being vegetarian when I saw my group had already chosen either fish or steak I knew I was gonna have to be THAT person and ask for an alternative. The host, of course, were more than happy to accommodate me. They mentioned their Sweet Potato Agnolotti so I accepted. It was amazing. I also enjoyed their house Cabernet a lot. The room that was reserved for us was on the second floor. It was nice to be able to mix and mingle on the balcony before our event began. The host were phenomenal as well. I can't wait to return.",2
5,I always leave so happily full and fully happy.  I love introducing people to Padero's Beach Grill.,2
4,"I noticed Panaderia Mi Linda Guatemala and stuck my nose in out of curiosity.  The man behind the counter was so sweet, I decided to give the place a try.  Baked goods were fresh; in fact, he was actively bringing trays out of the oven when I was there.  There were a variety of traditional Guatemalan choices available...breads, cakes, pastries, and cookies. A Guatemalan couple I met there recommended the cake and cookies with coffee, which was also available. I enjoyed the items I tried. I loved the owner...what a doll!  There was seating available, and plenty of lot parking.  Very casual atmosphere.",2

5,"Normally, evaluating a fast food chain would be absurd but..Church's Chicken rocks! So much better than KFC and if you are nursing a hangover, this hits the spot. The biscuits are buttery, sweet goodness. Mashed taters and gravy consistency is perfection. The right amount of stiffness without being a brick although I recommend a little salt and pepper to spruce up the taste.  Just like I remember from my Southern upbringing. Do not count calories at this place. And no, I do not make it a habit to hit up Church's on a weekly basis. I consider I nice treat every couple of months. Price is good and service is fast even when there is a line and there usually is a line at this location on Lindbergh in South County. If I am going to do fast food, this is my place of choice.",2
5,"I brought my boyfriend here on a Saturday for a tour and beer sampling since Yuengling is one of his favorite beers. We never knew it was so close!Be sure to look on their website for tour times before going and read the FAQ's. - First note: There were many people wearing flip flops on our tours vs. the insisted closed toe shoe policy, but that could be because of the next note.- Second note: There is no production/brewing on Saturdays so the brewery is quiet and empty.We looked around the main waiting/lobby area and gift shop waiting for our 12p tour to begin.  We had quite a large group, which had to split into two smaller ones. The tour lasted about 40 minutes, starting with a ten minute video of the history of Yuengling and the rise to present day. Next, the guide takes you out to the brewery, and into the kettle room, around through the lab, the bottle line, and the holding tanks. The tour was informative and hands on. Our guide was informative and knew quite a lot about the history and brewing process. She did a great job!Once done, you loop back into the lobby where the tasting room is and it's drinks galore. The BEST PART? FREE. Tips are encouraged! ;)We tried the Premium Lager, Lager, and Black and Tan. Sadly they were out of the Lord Chesterfield this day and the Premium Light is not available here in FL.Overall, a great tour and I will be revisitng with my parents when they are in town!",2
5,"......So I'm from Cali where there are no shortage of Vegan joints, and I must say this place would for sure be stiff competition for a few of the Cali franchise joints. And the Staff was beyond Stellar. And they where open during a snow storm.......Loved It!!",2
5,This tour was great! Captain Ian was knowledgeable and funny. He answered all of our questions. We saw a few alligators and even some wild pigs! Everything was fun and well worth our money! I would recommend this tour to a friend!,2
5,"I absolutely love this place!! The food is always excellent, and the service is the best! I've tried several dishes, and nothing has disappointed. The fish & chips might be the best in middle TN. Pizza is fantastic! Wings, sandwiches - all great. My favorite is without a doubt the Bangers and Mash. I've had this dish at several spots, but theirs is the best I've tried! They also have great craft beers! Their Fatback Amber is amazing, but they are all good. I highly recommend giving this place a try!",2
5,"Highly recommended!! Excellent food, great service!! Came to the quarter looking for something authentic. We found exactly what we were looking for and more. The shrimp creole was fantastic! It went great with the local blonde ale. Our waitress, Delores, was an absolute delight. Great overall experience!",2
4,"If your dumb enough to bring your car to any pepboys to get anything done then well, you deserve to get ripped off, treated like an ass or get shitty customer service.. i give four stars because i needed tires and well i got ripped off lolol... as far as everything else this place is great for parts and other little things automotive/garage related.. never had a problem with help at this store. All the guys/gals that work here are super friendly",2
1,"I can not believe on how unprofessional we were treated today by you shift manager Ashley at the original location. Food was ordered for a couple of girls in our office and when dealing with Ashley the young lady from our office got into a long drawn out convo with her and they had words. I was not the one on the phone call, so I did not think I was going to be treated poorly, but I was.  I don\'t understand why Ashley would not give us her first name unless she was concerned about something. By her doing so, it made myself and a co worker that came in with me feel as if something was probably done to our food. The guys in the kitchen were watching us curiously, trying to hold back from laughing as if maybe they spit in the food. I called the owner David to discuss all of this and he did not take the call or call me back",0
1,"Probably the worst BPs, low quality food and service. They definitely use hot dog water ice cubes.",0
4,"My family and I had a reservation here on a Saturday night (which I highly recommend), and we all enjoyed our meals! It states business casual as the recommended attire, but there were people who dressed casual. The staff are all nice and accommodating.After we placed our orders, we were given complimentary French bread and butter. I tried not to get full from it, but the bread was too good! Some of our orders included: honey glazed pork chop, bacon-wrapped shrimp and grits, gumbo, burger, filet mignonette, and crab ravioli. Everything but the burger was a hit. My father-in-law thought his burger was a little dry, but he ate it all anyway...which states that he liked it in a way? When my mom's gumbo was too dry, the waiter gave her another gumbo. The place is a symbol of great dining. I would recommend this restaurant for those visiting NOLA. Since it takes reservations, it is advisable to do so!",2
5,The food was excellent even the beans and rice taste great. The chicken enchiladas are amazing. The prices aren't bad and the service was good.,2
5,"The food is always outstanding. I recommend the grilled chicken hoagie and their garlic parmesan wings. The wings are baked, which I very much prefer. Always tasty, and they've turned around their delivery and pickup time dramatically for the better. My go-to pizza joint in the neighborhood.",2
5,"I swear this place can really do no wrong.  I usually end up choosing the chili cheese etouffee, but I've had just about everything on the menu.  The food is authentic and the service has always been quick.  The pricing is unbeatable also.  Don't forget to get double bread for an extra 50 cents to dip into your entree.Also, remember to bring cash because they do not take credit cards.",2
1,DO NOT GO HERE THEY ARE THE WORST  GO TO MASSAGE ENVY IN MT LAUREL OR CHERRY HILL AND BE TREATED RIGHT Hand & Stone is a money hungry thieving deceptive company. I had the worst massage at the Marlton location then as I went to pay with a Gift card that was given to me as a gift I was told by the rude receptionist that I had to pay $11.00 because my card had expired. SO I RECEIVED A TERRIBLE MASSAGE AND WAS RIPPED OFF FOR $ 11.00. I filled out a bad survey online then received a nasty email from the Manage her name is Jessika Morrow SHE WAS THE WORST I guess she feels it's ok to talk to customers like crap has horrible manager skills and should not have this position. when I said I would leave feedback as the worst place and massage I have ever had her response was I DON'T CARE DO WHAT YOU WANT... GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS The worst. I then called the Corporate Office and asked to speak to the Owners of the Franchise there names are Steve and Fred Vaccaro needless to say after leaving 3 messages for them to call me about this terrible situation they could have cared less to have called me to listen to my concerns. I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO HAND & STONE AGAIN I GUESS THE $11.00 WAS WORTH LOSING A CUSTOMER KEEP IT UP AND YOU WILL BE HEADED WHERE KMART AND SEARS ARE GOING.....GREAT JOB JESSIKA WHAT A GEM...,0
5,"I haz mad love for this place which is absolutely the GO TO place if you fancy yourself a mixologist. Or an alcoholic. And even if you aren't an alcoholic, they have so many lovely choices that you could soon be on pace to be one after talking to the super helpful staff.I had been here a few years ago and it was nowhere near the empire it is today. They have great selections of wines and liquor in a store with a relatively small footprint. I had fallen into a bad rut with my red wine habit which I was standing in front of sighing, knowing that the spark in our relationship had fizzled, but not quite being ready to break up with my go to wine. A clerk took mercy on me and suggested that if I like something that was full body but not ultra high tannins, I should try Charles Martini Cab and a Francis Ford Coppola blend. Both were amazing and sooo much better than what I had been drinking at about the same price point.I had come in with an out of state friend who was looking to get awesome whiskeys and found a better selection than Frugal McDougal's. I also picked up some new bitters for my growing bar and, don't you judge me people, some giant sippy bags of margaritas. I don't know why. They were on sale and it was pregame time of year. As I stood in the check out line looking at the oversized sippy boxes that were the equivalent of a giant glass of margarita, the checkout guy seemed to sense my doubt. He said, ""you know what these are good for?"" and I shook my head to indicate 'not really'. He then held one up to his mouth in a mock chug and said - Red lights with no cops around.It was all the wrong. So, you know. They are clearly my people.",2
4,"We came here for lunch since my very special guest was on a very special diet and this place seemed like there was a wide range of options to choose from. We got seated pretty fast. The food portions were huge! I got a steak quesadilla and it came with soup, a pretty big salad  and fries! I obviously could not finish it all and had to take most of it home. They could, however, do a little better job on seasoning the food. The prices are very reasonable.",2
4,"Holiday Inn Express is a good place to stay for a night while on a business trip.  Did I miss having room service, yes.  Overall, I would recommend this location.",2
5,"Fantastic service from the owners at lunch, great prices, large portions. My chicken tikka masala was phenomenal, as I was able to customize the spiciness (many places around here don't ask). This was more proof of fresh food made to order. I will definitely be coming back, but bring cash if you're spending less than $15!",2
4,"Wow! Great recommendation by the Green House Inn staff!  Happy hour was great - although there was wait to be seated (we eventually were sat in the back room that was completely empty until we were shown our table). Oysters, pate, fried oyster salad were impalpable - but food envy of neighboring tables burger, gumbo, and the special!A must!!",2
5,"I highly recommend Rebecca to plan any event!!! Our wedding was held in July 2017 at Our Lady of Mount Carmel and San Ysidro Ranch.Words cannot express the gratitude surrounding all the effort, professionalism, grace, speed to action, constant communication that Rebecca showed throughout the planning process. Rebecca is so highly connected in the industry whether in SB or LA and has so many connections that it made our decision making process that much easier.  Rebecca was tasked with 10 weeks to plan our wedding at Our Lady of Mount Carmel with a reception at San Ysidro Ranch coupled with a welcome dinner the night before held at the Lark. We went from about a guest count of 20, not planning on adding rentals...to a guest count of 50 with every single detailed planned to perfection.  Rebecca took the lead on one of the most important items - the timeline and boy did she stick to it!  Secondly, from our furniture rentals, to music, to dishware rentals, lighting rentals, working with the incredibly talented Camillia Floral Design and my favorite photographer Jessica Claire my dream wedding came to life in a matter of a few weeks and was captured by a spectacular photographer all thanks to Rebecca!!!! Lastly, The day of my wedding Rebecca kept me on time, calm and helped to handle the typical family drama that may occur.  Rebecca worked seamlessly with the church coordinator, Dori and the ceremony was perfect!!You made my day SO special and I cannot thank you enough Rebecca.  Thank you for taking on every new task I threw your way all the while remaining calm, cool and collected and keeping everything on track!THANK YOU REBECCA!!!",2
4,I moved in this area around October of last year and I had not stopped at this location of Angelos pizza until today. I will definitely be returning as I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and I saw their pizza that looked really scrumptious. This is run by real Italians and I will be back. The food was Magnifico,2
5,When I'm in SB I Always make a stop here for some great food.Had  beef and broccoli and it was delicious. Full of flavor and good portion. Like to be my own critic because everyone has different opinions about food.  Will definitely come back.,2
5,"My boyfriend and I ate here for our first meal in Nashville. They said the wait time was an hour and 15 min but it only took us 45-50 min which was awesome. While we waited, I got some macaroons, my boyfriend got big chocolate and cream cheese cookie, and both were amazing! The coffee was also pretty good. We ordered Pastrami Poutine and we were really impressed. Then we ordered drinks. I got the ""Not So Bloody Mary"" and he got the ""Bees knees"". Both were very interesting and unique. Not something we could drink all night but worth the experience! Then for our lunch we split the Spicy Bianca pizza and was definitely enough for both of us. All in all is was a great experience. This restaurant was very unique!",2
5,Always the sweetest ladies! Appointments never take forever and barely any wait time!,2
4,"Finally made it down for brunch today, and loved everything.  Great service, great mimosas.  Food was amazing.  We ordered the loaded biscuits and gravy, sweet potato hash, and 'chicken' & waffles.   So delicious.  Would LOVE to see a kids' menu at brunch.  The regular portion is a bit too much food, and a little pricy, for our 6yr old. But it tasted good, so we helped eat his meal. :) Will absolutely be back. Try the noochy grits and the braised kale!  Yum!",2
5,"I went in for a quick donut run around 5pm. The donuts were still very fresh and not stale. There were many unique donuts to choose from so I went with an almond joy, vietnamese coffee, chocolate sprinkle and cookies and cream. All were fantastic! I'd be back, if I lived in the area. :-)",2
5,"My absolute favorite cafe in the city. Their black and white latte is probably the best I've ever had (not too sweet and just the right amount of foam), soups are always really good (even for non-soup people) and there's just a lot of space to do work. The noise level is perfect, the music is at a perfect level, and I always enjoy when patrons bring their dogs. I'll keep giving them my business for as long as I can.",2
4,"I'm sitting in this location right now and I'm very pleased. The inside looks clean and well-kept. Maybe even recently refurbished? I think most people use the drive-through so it's not too crazy inside. However, the parking lot is a nightmare, so watch out for that. The person on the register wasn't terribly nice, but the service was very fast. On the plus side, they do have free, functional Wifi, unlike some of the other DD locations that I've visited lately. I'd definitely come back again.",2
4,"Very nice high end Marriott Hotel.  It is pricey but worth it.  Check out the deals on their website, we got a Labor Day special that included, breakfast, and parking for $199,Both side of the hotel have great views.  If you are a Gold Marriott or higher member, you get additional perks that make it so much better.The only down side was that everyone and their child, stroller, teenager, grandmother with a Gold Card was in the private lounge and it was a bit of circus.The staff was very nice.",2
4,"Best pizza in my neighborhood. Better than NYPD, Zios, Pandora's, etc. I highly recommend the personal size for one person. Their eggplant pizza is outstanding. I'm also a big fan of sausage and mushroom. The sausage is actual slices of Italian sausage, not those nasty crumbly bits you get at a lot of places. Prices are reasonable.Haven't been too impressed with the rest of the menu, but for pizza near Jefferson, I don't think you can do any better. Burgers aren't bad too.",2
4,"The Samson Kabob house on 13th and South is a surprisingly beautiful restaurant. The space is very tastefully decorated and has very nice lighting, chandeliers, tasteful artwork and high ceilings. Samson Kabob is BYOB. We ordered the hummus and this came with Afghan style flat bread that was hot and tasty. I had the Lamb kabob and this dish was a winner. The lamb was tender and juicy with great spices and an awesome grilled flavor. We also had an Afghan Manti dish, which is sort of like small dumplings in a spicy yogurt sauce. This was delicious also. The Kabob was served with rice.Samson Kabob house had a decent variety of vegetarian dishes on the menu also. Most entrees were in the $16-20 range. I really liked the food, atmosphere and service...and that lamb kabob!4 solid Yelps.",2
5,"I was here a few weeks ago and this experience really stood out for my trip. Kerry was a gem, he even helped me locate the coffee shop to purchase their coffee which I fell in love with. I would definitely recommend",2
1,"Beware.    Negotiated a price on a high end Pilot (used) over a couple of days.    Finalized everything, agreed to a price, and that very afternoon they sold the car out from underneath me.   Very disappointed in Roman and the sales management team.    Stay away.   There are better dealerships out there.",0
5,"I've tried many ice cream shops in New Orleans and this one has made it to the top of my list. It has by far the best ice cream in town. As soon as you walk through the doors you take a step back in time. It reminds me of many hollywood movies based in the South- it definitely has that old world charm. There are so many delicious flavors to try and it's usually hard to choose just one.  However, over time and many flavor tests I find that I tend to gravitate to chocolate flavors. My personal favorites at the Creole Creamery are the entire chocolate section  (located on your left as soon as you walk in); more specifically, the chocwork-orange (a dark creamy chocolate ice cream with a hint of orange flavor), the butterscotch english toffee (soooo good) and lavender honey (who doesn't love lavender?)What's your favorite flavor?",2
4,Very good calzone Chilly in the restaurant Very good service I recommend the calzones,2
4,"I must admit when we saw the place totally empty on Sun at 6PM, I was concerned.We ordered the combos to get a taste of various items.Food was plated quickly and served with a complimentary beer.I have to say that for the most part, each item was really excellent. I will elaborate.Brisket was absolutely perfect! Tons of flavor, super tender, some fat (but that is not only expected, it is desired) The BEST!Ribs were also super moist, and very flavorful. I read that some reviewers had dry ribs. These were seriously excellent. There were so many BBQ sauces to try too. I have to say that there was little need to put sauce on it... yes, that good.Pulled pork was great, a tad too salty, but by no means unpleasant like another reviewer stated. Very moist, great flavorThe chicken was a pulled chicken. I guess I should have been clearer and asked for BBQ chicken. The pulled chicken was good, but also a little over salted. It seemed to be white meat that was shredded.They DO have collards (not on menu). And they were very goodThe spinach was a bit better in my opinion as they had a generous amount of garlic and olive oil (very Italian) Garlic mashed were very good, Cole Slaw was also very good.Now that we tasted most of the menu, the standouts for me were the brisket, ribs, and spinach.Another reviewer was disturbed by the Italian language TV channel. Seriously?  get over it!The owner/chef is Italian and speaks the language. This also explains why they also have pizza. I cant wait to try the pizza next time.We both loved this place and can't wait to return, however weight is an issue.... so wait we will.",2
5,"I am so excited about this hotel. It is really a hidden gem. We arrived at 8:30 am, planning to store our luggage until check-in time. The very friendly lady at the front desk, gave us a room immediately. She was very kind. They had a guy take up all of our luggage. He was very friendly. Once in the room, I discovered a nice room, nice tv, and best of all, AVEDA bath products. They even leave guest a travel kit with cotton balls, q-tips, and a finger file which we really needed after a seven day cruise. Hands down, best hotel I have stayed at, and I have stayed at many. If and when I return, I will be staying here for sure!!!",2
5,Been wanting to eat here for a while but haven't managed to get here. Finally passed by and stopped in to get the Harvest salad with chicken. Staff were friendly and the salad was so fresh and absolutely delicious! I called to thank them for the great salad! Definitely have to go back for brunch,2
5,The food was amazing. The Kani salad and crazy Friday roll was my favorite. Even the basic California roll was delicious. I can't wait to come back. The servers were super friendly too.,2
5,Great little hotel. Very helpful staff from front desk to valet to GREAT service in restaurant @ breakfast and dinner. Lovely art work everywhere. Comfortable beds. Recommend highly.,2
4,"The food is delicious. The bacon wrapped dates are the bomb! However, you will spend some money here. The portions are a bit small for the price. My wife and I ordered 5 tapas between us and could have ordered more. You won't be disappointed though. It was all very good.",2
5,"One of my favorite spots in Tucson! The Restaurant: A romantic and dreamy atmosphere in a historic train depot. They told me at my place of employment to be a ""women's libber"" & not rely on any Prince Charming coming along to take care of me. Whatever...when he comes, I want him to propose to me at Maynard's. Fabulous ""French-inspired"" American cuisine. Sunday Brunch is excellent! I love the creamy white polenta -- delish! Now that the weather has cooled down a bit, you can still enjoy it outside with the toasty patio heaters.The Bar: Great Happy Hour, Monday-Saturday, from 3 - 6 pm. It's hard to find establishments with Happy Hour on the weekends! They feature $7 bar eats, and 1/2 off glasses of wine, wells, and drafts. They usually have a couple of cocktail specials, as well. On my last visit, I was pleased with a cocktail called, 'Tequilas' Dirty Sister' (resposado, raspberry habenero shrub, grapefruit, and bacanora). It had a nice kick!The Market: After a brief construction hiatus (although it seemed like an eternity to me), they re-opened at the beginning of November. The first items I grabbed upon their return were sautéed Brussels sprouts w/ grapes (from the deli case) and a bottle of Pinot Grigio to go. Good choices! I'm still making my way through trying some of the items in the newly designed market, but I have especially loved the Croque Monsieur (Madame with a sunny egg) and the raspberry cheesecake in a jar. If you return the jar, you get a $1 off your next purchase. Available seating has expanded in this new layout, with more space to dine-in. I often come here just for grab-and-go meals, though. I love the take out salads & sandwiches (kale Caesar, superfruit grain, portobello w/goat cheese sand, etc....YUM!). You can also find Isabella's Ice Cream and Tucson Tamale Co.'s tamales in the freezer.The Wine Club: 2 bottles a month (1 red, 1 white), 25% off cases, free monthly tastings, and discounts on wine dinners -- $60 for a 3 month membership or $230 for the year.  The Sommelier here is so very warm and friendly! Check it out!",2
5,"Let me be the first to begin with the statement I would be incredibly surprised that Yoichi's is not on Michelin's radar. Incredible experience: The ingenuity, the flavor, the precision, the plating, and the service were flawless.I've read other reviews as to ambience and it puzzles me as the beauty in Japanese style and aesthetics is about simplicity. It further underscores that with simplicity as the backdrop, the food can truly be the hero of the moment as described above.The only heartbreak of the evening is that we discovered the Chef and his lovely proprietor wife  lived in San Francisco. So my city lost a jewel; nevertheless, happy for Santa Barbara for their new found treasure.  Promise you this: My Chef partner and I will not be waiting until another birthday to enjoy in the delight of Yoichi's.",2
1,"Food is good.  Decor is nice.  Service was terrible.  Our drink orders were not what we ordered.  Rather than tell us they don't carry certain items,  they made up their own drinks.  It was terribly disappointing.",0
5,"I went here for the first time yesterday, and I was so happy! I have been in Ardmore for over two years, but never went to this salon for a pedicure. I was always driving out of my way to somewhere in KOP. However, never again! I got the best pedicure I have ever had yesterday. They do the best job and Estela was amazing. Thank you olive nails  for the best experience, you'll be the only place I ever go back to.",2
4,"My coworkers and I have decided that we are going to do a bakery crawl every Wednesday. This week crawl for me at A Little Taste of Heaven. This place is right off of Main St in Edwardsville, IL. This is a grab and go place. Parking lot across the street. The bakery boasts chairs but only in their front window. The owners greet the customers and it is a quick grab and go. Today we tried the cookies, They had four different kinds in the case, and after I got my order and man walked in and asked for the cookies that they were famous for, just my luck they were coming out of the oven. They are a triple(yes triple) chocolate cookie. I selected the Blueberry Almond cookie, it was chocked full of blueberries, I almost did not feel guilty eating it because it had two super foods (blueberry and almonds). We also got the chocolate chip, this was a little crusty, I am sure it would be a good dunking cookie, but I only dunk basketballs not cookies. Finally we got the oatmeal raisin. It was a nice cookie, but I think my recipe is better. The place lives up to its name... Bonus, they do sell coffee to go...No almond milk though.",2
2,Hostess staff less than cordial (girl with the 'Sideshow Bob' hair acts like she really doesn't give a Debbie Wasserman Schultz about her job); wait staff mediocre and tried to charge us for something not ordered that a manager gave us to make up for poor performance; foo foo food with a fancy cook's name; waste of expensive space,0
5,"Had my daughter 's birthday party after dinner at the HARBOR! Our waitress was wonderful, all the staff helped pull it off. Even joined in the celebration, was very nice of them. Nothing could have made it better!! I just love to eat at THE HARBOR, family tradition still going strong.",2
5,"Amazing Creamery -- a great selection of flavors! I sampled a variety of flavors before I had to make the tough decision of choosing which ones to eat! My friends ended getting the awesome sampler scoops (4 flavors for $5 or 6 flavors for $7) and was able to try so many flavors! I ended up with two delicious flavors -- Red Velvet and Strawberry Sangria in a waffle cone! The decor was super cute-- chalk boards with flavors written on there in a colorful fashion, and hand made drawings were dangled about. The fill of fresh made waffle cones also permeated the air, really riles up the sweet tooth in a person. (;Noteworthy flavors:- Creole Cream cheese (cheesy vanilla goodness)- Champagne Violet (really good vanilla flavor with a hint of floral)- Red Velvet (cream cheese goodness with chunks of red velvet cake throughout)- Strawberry Sangria (fresh strawberry taste in sorbet form)- Pop (tastes like strawberry cream soda!)",2
5,This place has an awesome ambiance and great wine! It was the perfect place to come for my bday!,2
1,"Bought my tires at Sears and got the warranty package for road hazard. Have brought my car in for low tire pressure six times since July. Each time they suggest an alignment, which I had done in July! It's been the same two tires I keep telling them that are low on air and to look to see if they have leaks. 4 times all they did is reset the TPMS system. I acquired a copy of the hand written notes! They did NOT fix the issues with the tires. In mid September, I was on my way to work when one of the two tires had a blow out. Brought it back to have them  fix the tire issues. I had to watch them the entire time to make sure they did the work. Before I was ready to leave they said I needed an alignment! Must be a money maker for them! I told them I had one in July. They did it complimentary and when I got the results, there was NOTHING wrong with the alignment! I waged a complaint to their corporate office. I was told the district manager will be calling me, that hasn't happened yet!!!  Back again for the left front tire today! Guess what? They say I need an alignment! NOT! DO NOT BUY TIRES FROM THEM NO MATTER WHAT!  Spend the savings at a more reputable establishment!",0
5,"This is the best concrete joint in the world, nay, universe! From standard concrete flavors (chocolate chip, strawberry, chocolate, vanilla, etc.) to The Christy (a giant brownie sundae) you really can't go wrong with anything you order. My personal favorite is ordering a vanilla concrete in a Cardinals Cap with Reese's Peanut Butter Cups on top, but the toppings list is endless so, don't feel pressured to copy my order. In the summer the lines will be around the block, but that's part of the experience so bring your dogs, your kids, your friends and make an experience out of it! During the Christmas season they sell Christmas Trees and Concretes, but will close shortly after until about April. An absolute MUST-DO in Saint Louis, so don't miss out!",2
3,"Reasons to go here:1) Good location; within other nearby stores2) Descent food compared to other inexpensive fast food restaurants in the area3) Staff seems friendly enough4) Seems clean*I have only been here once, this experience may be an anomaly  Reasons to avoid:1) T-888's love to eat here; j/k terminators don't eat.  That would be stupid.",1
4,Service is rarely that great.  Food hits the spot.  They also have a few vegan meals on the menu which are delicious!!!,2
5,"i decided to try this place after a ""soup nazi"" type of lunch experience i had there in the fall. (aside from the diva-ness, i wasn't incredibly wow'ed by my meal.)  i went for dinner with a friend since she had never been to this restaurant. as always, the decor is awesome; i like the clean semi-cramped feeling. on to the food...i had the watermelon salad and the roasted bell pepper with lentils. OMG! i would choose this meal as my pre-execution fare if i were on death row.  first off, the watermelon salad was ridiculously delicious. there were pieces of watermelon, some radishes, some other vegetable that i can't recall right now, and slices of some unpronounceable white cheese. those ingredients are kind of exciting on their own but what set that dish apart was the freaking oil-based dressing. i don't know what they put on top of that salad but it just made the whole dish come together.the roasted bell pepper was ENORMOUS. i didn't realize how big and filling that dish would be. the bell pepper had some mix of lentils, raisins?, cheese, and whatever extra deliciousness the chef decided to throw in to blow my mind. accompanying the bell pepper was some kind of tomato ragout with a dollop of soft, i'm guessing, goat cheese. whatever it was it complimented the bell pepper fantastically.all told, the total cost wasn't ridiculous for both items (i think i paid almost 40 usd with tax and tip.) given this experience, that chef can be soup nazi if he wants.",2
1,Never had a haircut in Mayfair but have had plenty of cuts in NYC (lived there 5 years) and Center City (working here 7 years now) with none comparing to the atrocious one from American Male.  I've paid from $20 to $100 for haircuts and I'll happily pay more for great looking hair but I guarantee it won't be found at American Male at any price they're charging.,0
5,Love love love this grocery chain. Full of healthy all natural organic choices. I could spend all day in this place. Especially love the homemade choices.,2
3,"The problem with this place is that as prime South Street real estate, the exorbitant cost of rent is inherently passed down to its customers through its overpriced food and drinks.  And I do mean overpriced.The food here is nothing special.  Nothing you will eat here will make you think, ""Oh my God.  That was the best ________ I've ever had.""You'll pay $6 for a Yuengling here and you'll hate it, but hopefully you'll be happy enough people-watching on the patio to forget about it.",1
4,"Beautiful spacious building (the lobby really is something worth stopping by just to see). Unlike most every other major train station of this size, it was surprisingly not all that loud. The bathrooms were not the cleanest, but for a public train station they were in good shape. And, if thinking about public restrooms hasn't ruined your appetite, there is a great selection of restaurants. Greasy Chinese food and American food buffet sit next to Cosi and Au Bon Pain, there is a Nathan's hotdog stand, one of those pretzel shops, Wendys and a few other places, rounded out with a descent sized magazine shop and a Ben and Jerry's. The passenger drop off could use some work, as it's a traffic nightmare... but otherwise, very convenient station.",2
1,I'm very displeased with my experience here the girl up front was very rude when I went up to the bar to get some drinks I was not carded when my friends who are african American went up right after me they were carded which they were already carded up front so I don't understand why they were carded twice and I was only once I think that was very racist of them the workers there just make you feel uncomfortable for being there i had such high hopes for this place I am so let down I will not be returning,0
3,"We came in for dinner with my parents.  Unfortunately, where we were seated it was rather dark. It was difficult to read the menu.  The pizza was hot but the crust lacked flavor and was very greasy.  We had to flag down the server to ask for refills and the night was not busy.",1
4,"This was my third visit to the this place, yet it was the first time my burger was even slightly interesting. It was more than that, it was great! I always wanted this place to be awesome, but every burger I ordered was under seasoned and bland. Not to mention the high price! You pay upwards of $10 for a burger patty that is only slightly bigger than a slider and you don't get a side with it. Now I'm willing to pay that when the meat quality is top notch (which I believe theirs is) and when the flavor is amazing (which it hadn't been until yesterday). So, maybe it's time for me to give this place another try.I have actually always been a fan of their fries, their house made sauces and their onion rings. Their ice cream was never really my favorite. I really prefer a creamier ice cream and I feel theirs is on the ice side. However, I think I've come to appreciate their special brand on ice cream and accepted that it's just different. My favorite flavor is cinnamon and my husband really likes the cookies and cream. I got to sample their chai and that was delicious as well!Annoyances worth mentioning:The service! I've always had servers with decent attitudes, but they've never been terribly attentive. I always feel like I'm looking around for them and waiting for them to come back. I don't know if they're understaffed??The noise! This place is super echo-ey and super loud! It made it pretty hard to carry on a conversation. Parking. It's not easy or cheap.Community seating. I've been at the community table two out of my three visits. Both times I was lucky enough not be sat right next to strangers. But it's still nit my favorite style of seating...Over all, I know I'm going to go back to this place. Especially since I finally found a burger worth paying for.",2
4,I've been here several times as well as the one in Ballwin.  The people are usually really nice and the food is good.  I can't say I've had a bad experience yet.,2
5,Have only ordered pizza but it was above and beyond every other pizza I've ordered in south Philly. Can't wait to try other menu items!,2
5,"Cute setting in Lafayette Square. Homemade Bread brought complimentary as you wait for your meal!! It was delicious....warm and soft! We had the toasted ravioli for an appetizer that was very good (pretty standard). It had a good marinara sauce for dipping. I got the whole wheat penne with a house-made meatball. It was very good. meatball tasted more like sausage than beef (I prefer beef), but still good. My husband got the canneloni, which he also really enjoyed. They offer 1/2 portions on the menu, which I got, and still wasn't able to finish my pasta. I can't wait to go back---really the bread set the stage for the whole dinner! Our waitress, Erin, was also very friendly and knowledgeable. Our glasses never went empty.",2
5,"The secret is out! By far the best nail place I've been to in STL and I've tried many. The staff is superb, friendly and the salon is very tidy. The best is...they remember you!",2
5,"This place is a delight for all the senses. Super cute and trendy, with tasty plates. A little on the pricier side, but they're always jam packed; they're worth it. I splurged for the ""lox and cream cheese on a bagel"" which they call ""pastrami salmon with whipped cream cheese and fried capers"". Fancy schmancy. Comes with micro greens on a wheat bagel. And it's delightful! Not an everyday food at $14, but a nice treat. Tea latte for $5, but again - a great treat and worth the occasional splurge.",2
5,"Probably in my top 2 favorite places in Brandon... Food is quality, crisp, and super fresh. Great blend of flavors in everything on the menu. I went for a time where I had to have the pad-thai at least once a week. Never really that busy (but they should be). Staff is super friendly and attentive, Price is low if you are looking at the over all picture and compare it to the worth. THIS PLACE IS SUPER CLEAN!!!! Which in my opinion is a good way to judge a quality restaurant.... and this place is spotless. Not kidding at all on this,,, you could literally eat off the floors in the bathroom. Spotless.If you live any where in the Tampa/Brandon area, do yourself a favor and check this place out... I want them to do well because I want to be able to eat there next time I am in town!!!!!!!!!!",2
3,"I've frequented this place with a friend several times but no matter how many times I come here, I always forget to bring cash. It is an extra mile to venture outside of this area to a bank to get some cash and come all of the way back. It's an established place where New Orleanians come for wings, Cajun fries, and the famous ghetto punch! It's the most delicious punch I've ever had: not too sweet, not bitter, and a natural blend of flavors for the perfect punch.After getting your cash, you would need to park under the bridge and walk across the street. Be careful and pay attention to the light. Keep your car locked and keep an eye out. At this locations there is no place to sit and eat, and it's not really comfortable to order and wait. You're standing the entire time, outside a pickup window; you can imagine how packed it may get if it rains or gets really cold outside. Personally, l think the wings are rather dry: they could use some juice or some oil to keep them juicy. The fries I love, but not more than I love the punch! Get a large if you can; you won't regret it. It's a little bit of a hassle, this place; Yet and still, the food is enough for customers to keep coming back.",1
2,"We had booked a late afternoon swamp tour with hotel pick-up. Called the day before to confirm pick-up time and location. We then went ahead and had a great day in New Orleans returning to the hotel in plenty of time for pick-up. Since I am on vacation, I had put my cell phone away. Luckily, checked the phone ten minutes before pick-up only to find out that there was a message informing me that afternoon swamp tours do not pick up at the hotel but at a central location which I now had to locate and get to in less than 10 minutes.Called cajun encounters, was given an address on Decatur street close to Jackson Square, looking for a bus marked cajun encounters. Address given was not anywhere near Jackson Square, bus was marked Audubon, not cajun encounters as told by the operator.Once we found the bus, the tour was rather nice, but the pick-up disaster was inacceptable",0
5,"Other than the non-parallel construction of the restaurant name, which annoyed my grammatically minded girlfriend, The Farm and Fisherman got everything right. The chef revises the menu every night based on what ingredients are fresh. All of the appetizers were tempting, but my girlfriend and I decided to start with a plate of mushrooms and a 24 hour roasted squash. The chef later told us that the mushrooms had been recently gathered by forager in rural Pennsylvania who had to sleep out in his car for two nights. The effort was worth it, we really enjoyed.We shared a middle course of slow cooked tuna and then moved onto a steak and a chicken for our main course. Overall, the food was probably the best I have ever had in Philadelphia.The restaurant is small, but manages to feel cozy rather than cramped. Assuming that I am able to get another reservation, I will be back.",2
5,Great experience this morning at Sierra Car Care. Needed headlight and taillight replaced and Andrew was fast and the price was fair. I'm new to the area but I'll be returning here.,2
4,"Overall, a great hotel! Pros: You'll enjoy the Starbucks and Ruth's Chris steakhouse.  Didn't hit the sports pub.  Extremely comfortable beds.  Rooms are a bit tight (at least our kind on the 16th floor was), but the furnishings are quality.  Cons: Hallway carpets were grubby and stained.  Also, the windows in the guest rooms were filthy.  As a Gold Passport member, I never did receive a single USA Today newspaper as promised each morning of my Memorial Day weekend stay.",2
4,"We'd been searching for just the right chairs to go with our dining table and not having much luck finding anything we liked that was reasonably priced, until we stopped in at the Ashley Home Store in Edwardsville. Our sales rep, Todd Shaak, was very helpful (and funny) and made our shopping experience a pleasant one. I will definitely go back again should we need any furniture in the future.",2
3,"So after coming here several times and after the thrill of the newness is over, I can review this honestly. This place is overrated. Their food is overpriced compared to other ""Healthy food"" places. Even With the sales it is sometimes not even worth it. The produce also gets old quickly and I can find the same items they carry here at publix for the same or even less. I do browse the sale options and I come sometimes for that after I compare them to other stores. The salad bar/ prepared meals are meh. Actually disappointing. I always end up driving to Whole Foods :-/ Every time I try to do my grocery shopping here I always end up having to go to other stores to find what I need for the week. I can't say that I have been able to come here and fully shop for the week and feel like I got the best deal. The only time I come here is for specific items like the enlightened ice creams because they carry almost all of the flavors. I don't hate it but it's just not the first place I would come to or think to do my full grocery shopping. The staff is really nice though.I wanted to like this place more but it just isn't doing it for me!!",1
5,"This place is so cute. The interior is adorable and casual. There's some small booths and chairs and tables for hanging out and enjoying your food/drinks. It's all so clean, too, which is a huge plus.There's a little section with baked goods, some Asian and some more American. They have mostly Vietnamese food, but I also saw some other types of food (e.g bulgogi).I came in with two friends and the woman who helped us was really personable and friendly. We ordered banh mi and boba tea, and sat down waiting for our food to be brought to us. The banh mi was really yummy, especially the bread. I had boba milk tea, which was as good as any milk tea I've had before. They have a drink card which you can get stamped to receive a free tenth drink. Definitely an incentive to return. Also, their hours are awesome, which is a huge plus.",2
5,I finally got a chance to try Danny Boy.  I had a flight of several beers that were all delicious.  I also had a 1/2 pound of bacon and chicken nachos.  The bacon was delicious and can easily be shared with several people.,2
1,Worst experience ever!!!! I stood in line today for 1 hour and 20 minutes for 1 shot. They the walked up in front of me and closed the line. Told me they were done and leaving. There were 60 people behind me outraged as well. F*** this place,0
3,"Cool laid back atmosphere, nice draft selection. A little inconsistent on the mixed drinks though.Ordered a Ketel 1 and cranberry, it was ok. Just your average drink. Ordered another, got a full glass of ketel 1 with a splash of cran, it  was OK .  I prefer consistency over being under served or given alcohol poisoning any day. I will be back, I am sure the newness kinks will be worked out soon!",1
1,Our service wasn't the greatest. They told us it takes 35-40 for a pizza and we were in a little bit of a rush so just ordered appetizers but those took 40 mins to get as well.,0
5,"Cake Life is one of my favorite bakeries-and I've only been there once! I ordered the chocolate chip walnut cookie, while my sister ordered the Campfire Cocoa cake. We received the Fiesta cake by accident, and the server was kind enough to allow us to keep both slices of cake. The cookie was crispy on the outside but chewy on the inside. Could've used a little bit more sea salt but the chocolate chips were so fudgey and rich so I didn't have much to complain about. The campfire cake was delicious. The cake is moist and fluffy, while the whipped cream is chocolatey. Reminded me of the days I'd come back home from school on a winter day and I'd rip one of those Swiss Miss packets open into warm milk. The buttercream is made with Swiss Miss by the way! The Fiesta cake is a bit more dense, with a cream cheese frosting. Definitely an enjoyable experience. The shop itself is very cute and beautiful. I'll be returning... very soon!",2
5,"If you come Tarpon Springs and don't have meal at Hellas that's gonna be a helluva good reason to come back to TS!We had a gang of 11 of us that came here for the day away from St Petersburg to chill out and feed our mugs!My fellow Yelpers thank you once again for leading us to the greenest pastures.... as I am now beginning to recite to myself "" as I walk through the valley of hunger I shall fear no starvation for YELP thou art with me Amen! We had to wait about a 1/2 hour to be seated as this place was hopping.We got a table for 11 and were a bit cramped but no one was complaining.... we started of with the flaming Cheese and fried Smelts as the appetizer and they were amazing!We all ordered the different dishes and there were empty plates at the end.  I had the Gyro Sandwich and have yet to taste one as good!We all ambled out of there and ready for a snooze in anticipation of more partying tonight!We will definitely be back!",2
5,"The food here is so good, they have a great patio and the staff is very attentive and professional. We had Lindsey from Seattle as our server and she was  awesome. Steak frites and Eggs were AMAZING.",2
5,Great family restaurant feel. Po boys had the perfect bread. We had 3 different kinds and all were tasty. Mac 'n Cheese was good and a little spicy. Really fabulous service.,2
5,"Cuernavaca is a great place for tacos. There are very few places outside of Mexico City street vendors that will get my endorsement for tacos, and this is one of those places.They have an amazing salsa bar to go with those tacos. Try some of their tripas tacos if your safety bubble is not bigger than arms lenght.",2
4,"this is my go-to place for sushi since i'm not in one of those sugar baby/sugar daddy relationships that all the rage right now per the news stations. $$ sushi is alright by me since $$$$ sushi is a pipe dream. i LOVE the mm naruto roll and the 911 roll. #1 because both are really delicious but #2 because they are absolutely gluten-free.  how do i know this? because the waitress i had the very first night i came here made sure to point out all the gluten free rolls after she spoke to the chef. the mm naruto roll is the perfect roll for summer. it's a bunch of raw fish wrapped in cucumber. (if you're trying to remain gluten-free, ask them to hold the crabstick.) the 911 roll is baked salmon and cucumber with some sort of peppery kick. i'm salivating a la pavlov's dog just thinking about these rolls.one star off for lack of consistency in roll size.  at dine-in one night, my mm naruto and 911 rolls were really tiny, but on one of my take-out orders, the same rolls were enormous. bonus: outdoor seating for when the weather is nice.",2
1,"Came down from Jersey after seeing the Dan Band perform, which was phenomenal! We got the urge to order a hookah with a liquor option. Walked over to Fez.. no one attended us at first so we sat down at the couch area. The place was dead for 10pm Friday. The attendant came and said let me seat you someplace else. I asked to keep the seat I was already at. He said we couldn't, so I told him to speak to whomever to get the approval. The guy came out and ask what's the problem. I said hey boss, your place is dead and we'd like to sit at the large couch area. He said they can't because that's for parties of 8. I said I understand, but there was no one in your store and if that big party ever came, we would move. Their answer: no we can't. I said no problem, packed my things and was ready to walk out. The guy asked are you really leaving? I said bro, no one is here. The place is dead. What do I have to do? Order a bottle? He said no again.. so.. went to a better spot! Saqqara Hookah bear broad across from City Diner! So much better staff! No young deutche bags trying to show how much more testosterone they have.Saqqara had great fast hookah service, really really great food and best part, was their service. They actually made the effort to cater to their guest. Fez.. you are the old 2017. Do better 2018! Saqqara, keep up the great work! You'll squash the competition in no time!",0
5,"This place is a vegetarian's dream! Food is great and their portion sizes are large. Although it is slightly over-priced, I highly recommend it (for meat-eaters too!). My personal favorite is the Crispy Ranch Chikn. I get it every time!",2
1,"I talked with the owner today and he said ""that does not sound like Marge."" Marge has been rude to a lot of people and they are afraid to tell the owner but I am not afraid to tell the owner. All the owner wants to do is talk to Marge. She will never change her attitude. All she does is pull the wool over the owners eyes. She even does friends laundry while at work and takes their money but does not log it as worked.",0
5,"This is just my first visit to M3 and we didn't eat only drinks at the bar.  But our bartender was fantastic with us. She made sure to pay attention to us and never let us sit without a full glass even though it was a busy Fri night and was quite busy. I have just moved to the area and happen to be barley a block away. I will be happy to review the food soon, I just got to get my butt in a chair there lol!",2
4,My daughter and I just visited this adorable bakery this morning and I was so impressed. The decor was beautiful and the employees were very friendly and kind. We bought croissants and macaroons and they were delicious! The croissants were crispy on the outside and melted in your mouth! The macaroons were a wonderful little dessert for after lunch. We all enjoyed them! It was a little expensive but in my opinion worth it for the high quality!,2
4,"This is one of the few hotels I have visited just to visit, and not to stay at. It's beautiful and really nice to just walk around and take it all in. My brother and sister have stayed here for an event, and they really enjoyed it, except for the high price tag. The convention center area itself is huge, with gorgeous carpeting, interior decor, etc. all around. There are frequently events and meetings at the convention center, so it's always pretty busy. However, what I really love is the garden area in the center of Opryland. As many of the other reviewers have pointed out, the entire area is enclosed, but it really feels like you are outside walking around in an outdoor garden that is always kept at a nice breezy 75 degrees or so. This in itself just amazes me. There are winding paths (nothing super strenuous), waterfalls, and beautiful greenery and flowers everywhere. There are quite a few shops and restaurants all around the hotel, but the pricing is pretty expensive (I will give a shoutout to Stax though -- a delicious make-your-own burger place). Tip: Park in the back near the Opry Mills Mall and take a short (5 min) walk to a side/back entrance of Opryland. You will save $20+ from not parking in the front.",2
4,"Great value dinner!  Food was good, great price, cheap draft beer, but the wait was a bit much.  Place was full at 5 and people didn't get food until past 6!  We got the grouper tacos, ribs, slaw, beans, cheese bread, and key lime pie.  All the food was excellent!  I would definitely recommend this place... maybe go at like 7 to avoid the first rush.",2
5,"Un.Be.Lievably delicious.Hubs and I stopped in St. Charles to crash with a friend on our cross-country road trip back from our honeymoon, and the goal was to get BBQ in every city where we dined.This was by far the best experience we had. We sidled up to the bar and loved seeing the old rusty butcher's-knife tap handles.The bartender was friendly, greeted and talked with us for a while, recommended a couple of local beers (all the ones on tap are local craft!), and we ordered some specials to go. We drank the beers while we waited, and they were delicious. The wait, by the way, was almost nonexistent. They had our food out to us in I think less than 7 minutes.I got the Texas-style brisket on special, with a side of sweet potato casserole and--I honestly can't remember the other side, because that one was so bomb, as were the ones with DH's meal.DH got the pick-two, with sausage and pulled pork, sides of cheesy grits and bacon-braised greens.Holy. Moly. It was all so mouthwatering that I wanted to inhale it. Portions were huge, too, so we had plenty left over for breakfast omelets in the morning. Thrilled that we made this awesome decision in our brief 12-hour visit to St. Charles. Can hardly wait to visit this place again.",2
3,Fast.  Fresh.  The carne was very good.  So was the guacamole.  Wish there was the ability to customize taco toppings.  The tortilla chips were too thick.  The dulche de leche  soft serve ice cream was amazingly delicious.  Wish that there was more seating.  Wish that table clean ups were more timely and more thorough.,1
5,The best and reliable guys like Nick the foreign car mechanic and best customer service managers  like Greg and Ann Marie. Highly recommend this car repair shop. Flo,2
5,what can I say? I truly believe my life just changed!! Cynthia is amazing! She is so kind and understanding. This was my first visit with her after having 2 bad experiences with acupuncture and she has made me a believer!  I have issues from menopause to polycystic kidneys and liver to chronic pain and I look forward to having Cynthia and acupuncture help me regain my life!,2
5,I have never been to snail salon that truly pampers their customers. The have a gel mani pedi for $45 or regular polish for $35. When you walk in they great you with smiles and are very welcoming unlike some nail salons I've been to. The give heated towels for your neck and back as you sit for your pedicure. Their pedicures are the best they really take their time massaging and perfecting your feet. They even use hot wax for a freshening peel on your heels. My pedicures take about an hour on average which I like. I've been to salons in the past that rush you so much and take a total of 20 minutes. The owner ensures that this is a relaxing experience for each customer. They also give a hot stone massage on your back as you wait for your nails to dry. In addition they have a rewards card  that is marked for each service. I have finally found my nail salon!,2
5,Let me tell you mina's is the place i always go to! The food is always good and the delievery is so quick! I am defiantly going to miss this place when i leave,2
5,"Great place with great food & service.  The location was clean and quiet, great for a morning wake up breakfast.  Both the Hyatt and the Fat Rooster staff were very friendly, and the breakfast buffet had a lot of healthy choices.  Organic yogurt, tons of fresh berries & fresh fruit, and made to order omelette served by a very friendly gentleman that greeted us when we stepped up to the omelette bar.  Overall excellent experience and would visit again!",2
1,"So my favourite Indian in St Louis is still Spice and Grill on Olive, Husband said lets have a change so we tried out Indias Kitchen this evening and ordered a portion of the goat curry.Sorry to say this curry was not great, the sauce was very heavy on the salt and tomato and the goat was tough as an old boot, the naan bread was below mediocre. Only nice thing was the rice.  Very Very dissapointed",0
3,"I reluctantly agreed to meet an old time friend here for drinks at happy hour, as the last time I was there it was unmemorable, but I left there pleased and liquored up.We sat at the bar, and was happy to see my tall, attractive, blonde, friendly bartender, who has been there for awhile, ready to serve us.  She was, and always is, quite attentive, cordial and a smooth operator.  My martini was filled to the brim, a large glass, very easy to get toasted, this is reason enough to go and sit at the bar.They have a happy hour menu which is quite varied, some selections are large enough to be shared, or small enough to eat a few by yourself.  The happy hour prices I thought reasonable.  Anyway, we started with splitting the dynamite shrimp, flavorful with quite a nice kick to the dish.  4 stars for that dish, about a dozen medium sized crispy shrimp in a nice spicy sauce, a great dish to share.  We had the chicken lettuce wraps, a decent 3 star dish, again large enough to split.  To be kind of healthy I ordered some steamed dumplings, the first serving of dumplings (3 dumplings of each) filled with shrimp, (just OK), the second was pork (good), and the third lemon grass chicken (the best of the bunch).  My friend had the ribs.  He said that they were ""not bad"".I haven't been there in about six months as I got sucked in to the lively bar scene at Redstone next door.   But for a few happy hour apps, large drinks to kick off my buzz, this was a good place to start and then we went to Redstone afterward to scope out the talent.  ;-)",1
4,"Best late night snack on Indy's east side. This place has been around forever and has incredible hot Italian subs. I won't go to any other place after 10pm. It's a local, family owned business that has been a communication hub for locals to hang around and ""shoot the breeze."" Definitely a must try.",2
5,"Holy cow! First time I tot his little dive bar and had an amazing experience! The food was great and the bartender was great at explaining the process. The pizza itself is a cheesy, crispy, deep dish pizza that has so much flavor from the crust to the sauce. We had pepperoni and bacon, which was amazing! Will definitely be back here again!",2
1,"If you want to pay for everything a la carte this is the place for you.  Food wasn't terrible not impressive.They brought a basket of chips and some tomato sauce which I asked politely for something spicier and some pico de gallo.  She brought them happily to me and the salsa was much better.  When asked what we would like to drink I asked for a coke and she brought out a bottle which I stated I wanted the fountain drink.  She said ""oh that's only Pepsi"".  Never mentioned that they only had bottle drinks for coke.  We ordered our food which was reasonably priced, asked for sour cream and also to put cheese on the taco.  She let us know cheese was extra.  It was $2.50 extra for another basket of chips.  When I received the bill we paid more for the condiments then the actual food.  Side of sour cream 2.00, pico de gallo 2.50, salsa 2.00, chips 2.50, cheese 1.00 and the bottled coke that we didn't want 5.00.  Just a suggestion...when you order anything make sure to ask if there is an extra charge.",0
4,I LOVE coming here after work. It's honestly the only burger place I approve of thats in the city. Its way better and way bigger burgers than shake shack. I absolutely recommend the up side burger it's definitely worth the money and if you have spare change absolutely get original fries and a fountain soda. They have berch beer !!!  and orange cream !!,2
5,"Fantastic restaurant located in the the heart of Jacksons square! The ambience was very classy. A bit pricey but, worth the experience. We opted for the pre-fixed menu, which included an appetizer, entree with about 5 different options and a desert. After dinner we took a trip upstairs where it is very eclectic. Although there is no food or beverage service on the patio, you can order a cocktail down stairs, and enjoy it on the patio over looking Jackson Square!",2
5,I can't say enough about Ice Cream 504!! The only bad thing is it's with in walking distance and we're finding ourselves walking everyday to get some amazing homemade ice cream!! The flavors are spot on!  I'd add a picture but it's always eaten before I get a chance! A must stop if your in the area!!,2
5,"This restaurant is one of NewOrleans best kept secrets!  Very authentic & fresh. Service is prompt, menu questions clearly explained , portions are generous.  Very reasonably priced.  Great for families also. No bar , but a large variety of sodas as well as ice cream in a store type freezer with sliding glass top . I felt as if I was visiting Mexico again. Highly recommend this restaurant.  I didn't ask if it is a byo place.",2
4,"If you want to be culture shocked, go to Marrakesh. It feels like a really authentic, cultural experience, supplemented by delicious food. The staff and management have been incredibly courteous and solicitous both times I've attended. If you're squeamish about eating with your hands or having to share food, you'll probably want to skip.",2
5,"I have celiacs disease, and was diagnosed at 19 years old. I have been eating gluten free for 13 years and there are times when I sadly miss the delicious sweet treats you get at a bakery. Since becoming gluten free, I have been in search of sweets that taste like ""the real thing"" if not better than the real thing.The Happy Mixer has NAILED IT. I have been given their cupcakes as gifts, and I can't even share them with others because they ARE THAT GOOD. I am also addicted to their brownies and oatmeal raisin cookies (which I get at Jules Thin Crust in Doylestown) and I am in love. The cost of their high quality goods is more affordable than anything I have found in a grocery store, or another bakery that is not strictly gluten free.This place offers fresh and beautiful items and you can tell that they really care about the food they are providing, and love what they do. I appreciate this place and hope that everyone, even those without a gluten allergy give this place a chance because this is BETTER than the real thing!Keep up the amazing work!",2
1,"I went in when they had 4 people working, waited for 15 minutes for my tea latte which came out as basically water. Returned it twice but gave up when the barista offered some other iced tea latte they already had instead. It was still the same - water. The baristas should REALLY REALLY learn how to make their stuff... seriously Starbucks??!!! So disappointed!!!!! :'(",0
5,"I am a regular at this store because it covers all my needs. I love their huge selection on everything, including many great organic and earth friendly offerings. My husband loves their fresh sushi bar and my dad loves the olive bar, I love the variety. I only wish they had a little bit better meat department. I would agree with @Jackie W.'s review, they do have great pre-made take out, my household like the sub sandwiches and fried chicken. I also love the employees, they are always friendly and repeatedly helpful. Keep up the good work.",2
5,"Good food, great milkshakes!! Loved it! I will definitely be back next time I am in town!!",2
5,Great great GREAT find! The Ruben was the best sandwich I have had in a while. Customer service was impeccable. Potato salad = wonderful. Pasta salad reminded me of a secret family recipe. MUST TRY!,2
5,"When my daughter was about a year-and-a-half old, Linda, the owner, helped me out by taking her for a drop in a couple times. My daughter is now four and a half and I have a one-and-a-half-year-old son. I switched school districts from Carson to Washoe and I kept going to all of these other daycare places and not getting a great feel, as well as the fact that they were totally booked for having an infant\toddler. I needed a place for both of my kids and there was just no where for my son..... My gut kept telling me go back to Circle of Friends. I've been extremely happy. Are there always going to be kids who attended daycare that I do not agree with their behavior? absolutely! There is no way to get around that whether it is in school, daycare, or a sports team or some other organized deal. I try the best of my ability to not let those other children's behaviors influence my own and we talk about it. Well the best you can for a 4 year old! I really like Linda and the whole staff. She has a little turnover and I really like that. The first place that my kids were at in Carson had turn over all the time..... The second place was a home daycare so she didn't turn over herself, and the other place was a mother and daughter run joint as well. They had very little turnover. That's important to me that employees stick around. So, my kid has been flourishing both emotionally and academically. She's picking up things that I'm totally surprised about.... Like starfish have two stomachs and octopus have 9 brains.... I didn't believe her and I had to Google them! I didn't read the Yahoo review, but people are always going to have mixed situations with whatever's going on for them. All I know is that Linda and her daughter helped me out greatly when I was in need several years ago, and she helped me out greatly this time and it's been a great fit. I'm very happy and content.",2
5,I had a great experience here! The ladies were extremely friendly. The gelato was OUTSTANDING. I had plain vanilla but it was so delicious. The red velvet cake was also wonderful. Highly recommended!,2
1,"I really don't like giving out 1 star reviews when the food isn't completely terrible, but everything about this place is just so mediocre that I can't find a single reason why anyone should go here.  There are so many better options for less money that I wouldn't suggest that anyone actually eat here because you would be wasting your time and money on bland food.Pros: The staff was friendly and the sriracha sauce for the fries was good.Cons: They got my order wrong and forgot the bacon, but I don't think even bacon could have saved this burger.  Once I realized how much I had just paid for a burger and fries without bacon I was even less impressed with Bagger Dave's, if that's possible.The burger was flavorless.  Not only are the portion sizes at the likes of Five Guys and Boogie Burger bigger, but I was amazed at how flavorless the meat was.  I'm no chef, but I can cook a better burger with Wal-mart beef.  The only thing I could really taste on the burger that stood out was the pumpkin BBQ sauce.  I just can't get over how pathetic this burger was, especially given how much I paid for it.  Words can't describe how let down and sad my taste buds were.The fries were a little overdone and also somewhat flavorless, which is probably why you get a cup of sauce to dip them in.  They're definitely not on par with the likes of Penn Station or Five Guys when it comes to fries.Overall I was quite dissatisfied with my meal.  I went in expecting some awesome new restaurant and all I got was something that doesn't even compare to Five Guys for a considerably higher price.  I honestly can't think of one good reason to even try this restaurant.  If you want a good burger go somewhere else.",0
5,"We had an excellent diner. The waitresses, Ashley and her colleague are charming. Great chef. Very good soft shell crabs. Thank you.Christian F. Paris, France",2
5,"Tip: Order on their website for fast, free delivery!Mumbai is probably the cheapest indian takeout I've had. The food is great and tastes much healthier than the other Indian restaurants I've been to in the past. There are some really great vegan choices and everything is marked on the menu as well. I really like that you can go on their website and order food for very quick delivery. I only eaten inside the restaurant once and thought it was good. I think Mumbai is more useful for delivery as the place has a fast-food feel. I would definitely recommend Mumbai Bistro!",2
5,First time diner and I will definitely be back.  The food was awesome.  Best fried cheese and wings I've had in a while.  Shelby was our server.  She did a great job.  I'm looking forward to coming back next week.  I can't believe on Thursday tall PBR drafts are 2.50.,2
4,"This was the first coffee shop I visited in Philly (trying to branch out from Starbucks) and I wasn't disappointed!The atmosphere is my favorite! There is plenty of room and plenty of tables to sip your coffee or pull out books to study (they offer free wifi). The shrubbery at the front of the door adds to the charm and makes you feel like it is a secret spot (haha). As a plus, the bathrooms are also very nice and clean!The staff is super great ! Quick to take orders and whip them up.  I saw them walking around cleaning multiple times.I ordered a pumpkin spice latte with almond milk.  It was very good! It didn't have a strong pumpkin flavor with lots of spice which some people don't like. A little pricey in my opinion around $5 for a small but that's usually how much lattes are anyways elsewhere.  All in all, I really enjoyed Good Karma and can't wait to go back, grab a coffee and study!",2
4,"The food is GREAT, and the portion sizes are more than generous. Great place for groups. Disappointed that they don't have beer on draft. Paper menus, slightly boring ambiance, and the decor is a bit outdated. However, with a fun group it is a great experience.",2
3,"In from out of state, just killing time. Nice selection of Midwest stuff, staff is helpful. We asked if they ship purchases and they acted like they were offended. Any place this size out West does. Anyhow, didn't see anything that tempted me to schlep it over to UPS. Bought a few little items that fit in our carry ones.",1
4,We really enjoyed our breakfast. The menu is different but still offers the basics. Great cocktail and mimosas menu. French toast was delicious as well as the eggs and homemade jelly. Bacon was outstanding.,2
4,Beautiful vintage items in an awesome space.  Her antique neighbors extremely nice!!!,2
4,Good selection - produce is always fresh when we have been there. Register employees are always friendly. I do like the little salad bar thing in the front of the store along with the wide selection of bakery items. The blueberry muffins are awesome! My kids always like the randomly decorated doughnuts. The fresh salsas/brushettas are good as well.,2
1,"Easily the worst gel manicure I've ever had. I called to make an appointment, and Sue did my nails. She rushed throughout my appointment, she was rough on my nails while filing them, and the whole process was incredibly uncomfortable. Each nail ended up a different length, even after I asked her to even them out, and then she began the polish. I ended up with red nail polish all over the edges of my skin and she couldn't be bothered to clean it up. She passed me onto someone else after my nails were done curing and I got the most pathetic little hand massage ever and was sent on my way. The whole process took about 20 minutes, but here I am on day 4 after getting my nails done, and most of them have chipped with two lifting completely. I called today to see if I could come in to have them repair my nails and was told they would have to decide if they'd fix it or not. My gel manicures normally last between 2-3 weeks easily, so 4 days is completely unacceptable. What a waste of money. I'll never go back.",0
4,Went there with some friends and I really enjoyed the atmosphere... My biggest problem was they can't make drinks! Stick  with the basic drinks...,2
5,"Staff makes this place. I am here now. I REALLY love this place. Great pizza great atmosphere. GREAT staff. This place is the best. Haven't tried it, need to!",2
1,never get take-out from this place ever unless you want to eat your lunch at dinner time.  Not only did it take almost 2 hours to get the food delivered but we were told a half an hour after we placed the order that it was on the grill(he called back because of credit card issues.)  I will never get anything from this place again.,0
2,"Living so close, I wish this place was decent. Food is weak, prices are too high for what you're getting. That said, the service isn't bad. Wish the food was better.Will never return.",0
1,"Looking for a hard to find book January 9 for a one year wedding anniversary for my wife that I bought a KitchenAid mixer for. The special KitchenAid mixer cookbook showed in-store availability, yes I know how to search within a store to see if it's actually there. I pick the store, I checked the availability within that store. It said in stock limited quantities. I'm only a half hour from there but it was rush-hour traffic. I get there and looked everywhere for the book. And I do mean looked everywhere. I finally gave in to ask someone to search for this books location or these books, this guy behind the information desk said I'm looking in the warehouse not in the store... I showed him where it says this particular store in store in stock etc. complete with store number and address. He continued to argue with me that it just means warehouse, it just means it's in the warehouse, it's just in the warehouse,.! Seriously? If something says available in a particular store and in stock with a green check mark next to it that means for all you people out there don't waste your time trusting it-go to Barnes and Noble. I can't believe how stupid these people are by goading people to come into the store just to create more floor traffic! I will never frequent the store again and I will make sure this review makes it to every Internet site I can put it on. I was seriously pissed off at their lies! Yes I know it's only a book, But I sat and googled every possible bookstore all over the place and that was my closest possible store to pick it up especially during rush hour traffic. I must say these people are serious douche bags.!",0
4,"Yum. Tater tots on pizza. Late night delivery that came faster than promised. Friendly staff taking the order, and a delivery guy who made me smile. Can't ask for much more. Thanks! We wish we lived closer...",2
4,Took a long time for me to finally come here due to formerly lack luster reviews. I had a great experience at lunch.  Service was kind and attentive; there were only 1-2 other customers. All 3  rolls were delicious. I will say they were notably smaller than other sushi spots. We noticed right away after sharing 3 rolls that we were not bursting with fullness as usual.Prices were typical. Specialty roll options not as abundant as competitors. Groupon deal was irresistible. Would have no problem returning but a couple other spots would probably be my first choice.,2
5,"Ok, so I'm a stalker of Marrakesh Express. But so what...First, I've been here about four times or so. Yes, he's only been open two weeks. Sounds like a personal problem to me.The shawarma is dynamite. He puts it between two pieces of pita and the presses it like a panini but better. It's got two sauces, olives, and the whole shabang. I also tried the ketban again and it was as good as the first time. Tangine was also great second time around.So..., what are you waiting for?! Get stalking!",2
1,"So P.O.'d...they were my 'go to' delivery place. Loved the traditional w/ half pepperoni//half artichoke. Tonight, I got a literally half-baked pie that was rocking the cold. You'd think that, after many orders, with @ least a 20% tip for the Driver...once in a flippin' while...he w/ be pleasant. Not.",0
5,"Who knew I would lives grocery store so much! I've been to a few publix grocery stores before but this one is by far the best one! They have an awesome deli section that has a wide selection of everything! I love that they have 10+ different types of hummus! What grocery store gives you that much variety? Exactly no other LOL! But there's also a ton of different salads, chicken salads, potatoe salads, salsa, etc...just so much! I love this store",2
5,"The most amazing thing happened today.  I walked into Andres Richard Salon on Locust St for my appointment with Stephanie, a junior stylist at Andres.  We talked, I showed her pictures and the magic began.  I came in for a balayage, a fix from my existing washed out, brassy ombre.  Stephanie was so sweet, attentive and definitely catered to my request.  Hours later, my hair is exactly what I wanted!  I spent most of 2015 crying out of Salon after Salon.  This is will be the only person that will ever touch my hair again.If you're looking for technical, creative, and expert hair care, you'll find it at Andres Richard.",2
2,"Never have I had such over cooked seafood, one of the worst temperature cooked scallops and octopus I've ever had. The romesco from the scallops was delicious, but ruined by the fact they were completely over cooked. Don't even get me started on the octopus, chewed like beef jerky. Kitchens gone down, wait staff was kind if there but never when needed",0
3,Good sized small venue. Maybe hold about 500-700. Toilets are pretty rough so be careful what you have for dinner before a show. Bar was not overpriced and the drinks were generous.,1
5,"I would use all the ink in Yelps pen to compliment this establishment.  This is a perfect example of price balance, speedy / accurate / polite service, hard working cooks, cleaner silverware than Sam Witches and Such, and good food.The special for under $3 M-F is 2 eggs with your choice of hashbrowns and toast or a list of other sides.  I've tried this with grits, hashbrowns, pancakes, biscuits and gravy, white toast, and bacon - all are absolutely perfectly cooked and served to you in less than 5 minutes.These are the fastest cooks I've seen.The waitresses are fast and polite, not overbearing.  This brings me to a delicate situation:I ALWAYS TIP THEM MORE THAN 40% AND I RECOMMEND YOU DO TO.Allow me to explain:  I happily tip just over 20% at Sullivans and Flemmings, even with a bottle of Symmetry by Rodney Strong, when the service is good.  I tip over 20% when the service is good at any restaurant.  If I tip 20% here, the waitress get 60 cents = no bueno.  She runs around for a heck of a lot more than that.  (In fact, I donate 60 cents every day to a child in another country that I don't even know).  So, I usually tip between 50 - 100% of the check here, and I implore you - if they give you good service, consider it please.Back to the review...A+++ on Ebay, thumbs up from Siskel and Ebert and 5 Stars on Yelp.  Check them out if you haven't, impossible to top for breakfast.",2
3,"Ordered delivery out to a airport hotel. I have to give them only three stars because it took 75 minutes to be delivered and the food was cold when it arrived.I ordered the chicken cutlet Amici, very good but also very salty from the prosciutto, mozzarella sticks (cold, but decent marinara) and a couple cannoli (these were delish, I probably would've given less stars had it not been so good. As a captive audience to the lackluster offerings around the airport, I was hoping for more, but expected less... 3 stars",1
5,First experience with Josh M. and A-1 Plumbing/Perfect Air and had a great experience.  Seemed sincerely to care about the client and well being.  Was not oversold on anything but given recommendations of what he would be doing if it was his home.  Felt very comfortable with the Josh and the Company's overall professionalism.  Will use for some needed repairs in future.,2
5,"Best Italian restaurant there is.  I always get the tomato bread or wings as an app, brandy cream sauce with spinach, and If I have room, I'll get their cheesecake or tiramisu.  Don't forget your wine, its byob.  Try their seafood specials if you get the chance.  I love them!  Service and ambiance is nice too, kinda diner-ish, but good for a date or family night.",2
5,"I went here on a date night with my husband and or food was terrific,  the atmosphere was very nice.  Definitely will be going back",2
1,"Haven't been to a Philllip's in a long, long time. So when work took me to the Sheraton in Philly I thought it was time to reacquaint myself with my childhood seafood place... Bad idea.The crab cakes I remembered as delicious morsels of ambrosia turned out to be overly greasy, too little crab, and much too little taste. At least they were edible. The grilled snapper (fish of the day) and asparagus that I got on the side were overcooked and drowned in butter as if this could hide the unmistakable blandness of the food.I was quite literally crushed. Hoping this is was symptomatic of the location and not the chain. Will have to try the one in Baltimore and pray that it lives up to my childhood memories.",0
2,"I don't know what so special about this place. I had classic chicken parm. It was okay, but I had expected something more than ok.",0
5,"Take plenty of Sun Screen !!!  Really well organized and run. Not a bad seat no matter where you get a ticket. I recommend a top row of the reserve grandstand. It is nice because you can bring something to hang on the fense to shade your back after mid day. Plenty of food and drink available but you can bring your own drinks just no ice-chest/coolers. I took a shoulder bag cooler, an insulated lunch box that held 8 drinks and that was ok.  Expect to have your bag searched for guns and pepper spray, no problem with a pocket knife. First races are at 0800 gate opens at 0700. Last race at 1630. There is a free concert after the last race of yo chose to stay longer. We will be back next year for sure.",2
5,"This hotel was fantastic. I was in town for a week, working at my company's PA office in Wayne. Great location and easy to get in and out. Hotel staff was very friendly. Room was immaculately cleaned and very spacious for just one person. Kitchenette was fully stocked with dishes, silverware, utensils, a small dishwasher and a full size fridge. Windows surrounding the king size bed were great- lots of natural light. I liked that opting out of housekeeping got me a $5 credit at the restaurant. The pool is small but no one was there the two times I went to use the hot tub. The bar has a decent drink selection, although I was bummed they were out of mint and couldn't make a mojito (which was on the drink menu). Burger was okay. Dessert was mediocre (but free with my $5 credit, so nbd). Omelet station was a nice touch in the AM. Coffee frequently had coffee grounds in it/was very weak, but the breakfast spread overall was nice.",2
4,"I'm not gonna lie, i consider myself somewhat of a breakfast connoisseur. I'm not saying anybody else considers me this, I'm pretty sure its just me. But regardless of the details i travel long, far, and wide for a good breakfast. My next stop on this adventure was Skyway Jack's, now this isn't the original Skyway, ill make my way to that one at some point. But this one was closer to work and i decided to shoot over and see what all the hype was about. And from my visit the hype was well deserved. Now there were a couple of glitches when i got there, they were down a waitress so one poor soul was stuck working the whole room, and the service suffered because of it. Mainly my omelet came luke warm. I was dissapointed but i took the situation into consideration and decided to give them a pass. When i dug in i was extremely pleased. HOME FRIES, get the HOME FRIES. This is what home fries are suppost to taste like, not bland, and tasteless. These ppl do it right, the omelet was delicious aswell, the hash was good. Was dissapointed at the quality of the biscuit, but aside from that everything was pretty wonderful. Now its not at the level of Kissin Cuzzins, or Frog Pond. Who at the moment i consider the mecca's of Pinellas County breakfast. But its just a notch below. 4 stars for Skyway, def worth checking out. They also have some cheaper breakfast options for those not wanting to spend $7 on an omelet. We can't all be high rollers like me.........lol",2
3,"TJ's Shoe Repair is one of the few shoe repair shops right in the heart of downtown Nashville.  TJ's is on Church Street right across from the Library. This place is really great because you can stop in on your lunch hour and get your heels replace on your pumps or get something else patched up fairly quickly.  If you need some more extensive reconstruction you may have to drop your shoes off, but this place is great for a quick repair.  So, if you broke your heel on the way to work, stop in at TJ's and they will get you taken care of.",1
5,I have gone to this museum many times as a child and once as an adult. This museum is so hands on. I love how interactive it is for the kids. Since it is a children's museum the target audience is obviously more for kids than adults but it was still fun to go there as an adult. There were many neat facts I learned about while I was there. The museum is a good size with (I think) three floors. They do have elevators for those who need them. There is a parking garage across the street and the prices are fairly standard for a museum.,2
5,"I had a wisdom tooth that was in serious need of extraction. I called my regular dentist and they were unwilling to see me for another 3 months, even though I was in a lot of pain. I was lucky enough to find out about Center City Emergency dental from a billboard on my way home one evening. I gave them a call and they were so respectful and sympathetic to my needs. They were willing to book my appointment the very next day. My visit was absolutely awesome. The staff here is unlike anything I've experienced at any other dental office... They are courteous, caring, friendly and they make you feel at ease the entire time. I appreciate that they clearly explain what you need and how much it's going to cost. Dr. Cabrera was excellent with letting me know what to expect during and after the procedure and answering all my questions. Overall, I am so happy with my experience here that I think I will make this practice my full time dentist. Not too many places can make you smile after a tooth extraction.",2
1,"Literally the worst donair that I have ever eaten in my entire life. Guy who was working was a total creep , I had about 4 pieces of donair meat in the whole thing. My friend got a poutine , the gravy was like water & the fries were mush. Cannot believe how disgusting this place is , never again in my life will I ever return ! Horrible !!!",0
5,Wings are amazingly flavorful! I love their beer selection as well... I would say the only negative is how small their menu is. There's little to chose from and you can't always get the same thing depending what day you go or what they have on the menu that day... but owner is very friendly and helpful.,2
5,Excellent food and great people! I'm a fan. It is my new go-to lunch spot now. Thanks guys! Keep being awesome!,2
5,"Decided to give this place a try on my lunch break and I have to say...I'm impressed. It's a little small but the decorations are pleasant l. Most importantly, the sushi is VERY good...and you get a good amount. I will definitely be going back.",2
5,"This was an amazing event space with exceptional attention to detail for each and every member of our team! We held a corporate retreat there in March and every local and out of state staff member was very impressed and pleased. Mark is a very gracious host who takes pride in his facility, his food and the service he provides. Thank you so much for a wonderful experience and we will see you again next year! FYI, the roasted red pepper hummus is amazing!",2
5,"This place is just crappy. But in a kind of awesome way. It isn't hipstery divey or anything. It is a great last bar for the night. The prices aren't amazing, but the place is super chill and unassuming. If you are there for more than a half hour, I guarantee that you will meet someone who is at very least interesting to talk to! Sometimes they have live music (usually just one person with a guitar). I very much recommend this place for anyone who doesn't at all care about a bar being ""nice"" or ""clean"" or ""fancy."" If you do care, I would stay away.Most of the bartenders are amazingly friendly and rarely if ever have an attitude. They make you feel very comfortable. This is just a great neighborhood bar!",2
4,"I had been to Albasha before in another city and was pleasantly surprised to find one in Metairie. However, I was hesitant bc I hadn't been to one in years. I was definitely pleasantly surprised! First, shout out to whoever controlled the tv's because I was entertained by some great foreign music videos throughout the meal. Not sure what channel but it was reminiscent of Bollywood music vids but obviously not Bollywood. You get the point!Second, service great. Everyone very nice. (Negative- they could have been a tad quicker- I've been twice now and both times have taken a bit longer than I would like). Now for the food- great. I always have to judge a Mediterranean place by their falafel and I did enjoy it. The bf tried kibi as his app- he loved. For an entree, I had the gyro platter. It was great. Couldn't ask for more when it comes to Mediterranean food! Atmosphere- I would say this is more of a lunch place. Prob wouldn't go for dinner or a ""date"" or anything but great lunch spot in Met!",2
5,This hospital is by far the best for families on the East Coast. They make seeing multiple MDs on the same day very easy and the quality of care is incredible. The renovated wing is fantastic with good accommodations for caregivers and friendly and attentive staff. I wholeheartedly recommend A.I. DuPont and will continue to travel from NY for my child's care.,2

4,"I like the Clue game lookalike of this hotel. Respectful bell boys and valet drivers, bartenders delivering our drinks to our rooms quickly, phone etiquette with nice customer service, and my gf and I would come back to this hotel next year, great area, a little busy streets in downtown Boise. Coming from Cali, this service is phenomenal. Thank you guys. Watch your money spending here. Mine as well walk around and get cheaper foods to eat. The con's is no air vent in bathrooms especially of ours.",2

5,"Even if you don't drink beer, this is a must-visit if you're in St. Louis.The tour itself is free and last about 1 hour. You begin with a quick history of Anheuser-Busch and go to the horse stables, where the famous Clydesdales are held. (I swear they live better than me). You get a chance to check out their large vats where the beer is aged, followed by an explanation of how they make their beer. You then get to go to canning, where you can see just how ridiculously fast beer is bottled and canned. Finally, it's time for free beer!There's even Stella Artois at the tasting room.The gift shop is really good for souvenirs too. So all in all, a must-visit if you're in St. Louis",2
5,Good food and service.  A great establishment within the Carrollwood Village community.,2
4,"Don't judge a book by it's cover.  Looked like a any similar bar food type chain like Friday's, Bennigan's, or Ruby Tuesdays... JB Dawson's is far better.Awesome experience from the second we stepped in, hostess greeted us with a smile and time to table waiting expectation.  We were promptly seated, and tended to right away with a smile and good attitude by a server, Nancy, who helped us with a beverage and app order.  For our app we shared the twisted shrimp as it was Twisted Tuesday.  Nancy told us this dish far surpassed Bone Fish's Bang Bang Shrimp, to our surprise, it clearly did.  Our beverage and app shortly followed. Shortly there after another server stopped by, Kyle, who was our designated server.  Boy, smile, great greeting, great attitude, engaging.  We talked a bit, figured our way through the menu and placed our order.For our dishes, my wife selected the Four Cheese Mac & Cheese side -- Sharp Cheddar, Pepperjack, Mozzarella & Reggiano dusted with bread crumbs with cornbread as she had large lunch.  Very good.  Unexpected, light, not overly creamy, not burnt, just right.  And the corn bread with maple butter..... ahhhhhh that was really nice. I ordered the fish tacos-- 3 Flour tortillas, seasoned tilapia, chimichurri sauce, mango cilantro salsa & a lime cream drizzle.  Passed on starch sides and had their asparagus that was cooked to perfection.  To my surprise the they were filling, nice size portion (see photo)  not a two bite app.  Very moist and super fresh fish.Great first experience all around expect one key aspect.  Their so called craft beer menu was really limited and did not contain a variety of types; focused more on IPAs.  Limited thinking for the bar manager I must say.  Kyle our waiter also bar-tends.  We got to talking and he offered with no questions to swap out my beer for another option --- Stoudts Scarlet, which is a reddish beer.  For my beer palette it was better then the others limited options had a nice taste at the swallow then waned off.   Kyle informed us that they buy for all 4 restaurants and try to find a middling that works across the 4 guest demographics.  Not a great decision honestly.  There are so many great craft brewers in the Bucks County region and even Bristol area that should be showed cased and tested through.  For me a bad or poor beer selection stunts the overall experience.We'll be back but I may need to sneak in my own beer selections from my craft collection.",2
5,"OMG. This dealership is amazing. What an incredible experience. We were in and out in 3 hours with the car we wanted and treated like royalty. The sales team and our rep Enver were awesome. Friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. No pressure. Wow. And the finance guy Justin was great. While waiting for the car to be detailed, I walked around the dealership and talked to a LOT of happy people. Guys buying cars, getting service, staff. EVERYONE was so friendly and courteous. It was a feel good experience all the way around. Highly recommend this dealership. Straight shooters. No BS. I got a great value for my trade in too.The thing that stands out is how helpful they are. Helping up get what we wanted in the most workable way possible.",2
5,"We have been here a couple times for happy hour and several times for dinner.  So we're on our way to being ""regulars."" The food quality is excellent, and prices are good -- good value for the money. (Roasted cauliflower and lamb chop appetizers are very good, salmon and short ribs entrees are tops.) Service has been WONDERFUL. We ate here one night with a friend who had suffered a stroke. The restaurant was very busy, and our friend insisted on trying to order himself, despite a great deal of difficulty in making himself understood. Roy, our waiter, was SO PATIENT, caring and compassionate -- he was just the best.  Tonight we were back and he waited on us again (without our friend with mobility and speech impairments) and again, Roy has got to be the best server in Tucson: he's  knowledgeable, honest, competent, efficient, and friendly without being obsequious or stuffy. Nox is not a fancy, ""white table cloth"" kind of place, but for a friendly, cozy, fun place in the neighborhood, it doesn't get better than this.",2
5,"Wow. From friendly owner/staff to huge portions of sushi and udon... I'm a very full and happy girl. We needed carry out sushi since one of my kid fell asleep. Decided on this place thanks to all the Yelp reviews even though it was 20 mins away vs the closer sushi joints nearby. We ordered: spicy salmon hand rolls, Nelson, dale and Corey, Arizona, sashimi appetizer, veg udon, miso soup. Love love love that they let you customize the level of spicy in your rolls. Yum!! Everything was extremely yummy. My favorite was the hand roll and the D&C. I just wished someone had warn me about the size of this overly loaded spicy salmon hand roll. It was huge and salmon in every bite.  The flavor in the D&C was soooooo perfect. Although, I had wish I asked to make it extra hot. I like my food spicy hot. It was a great last night in FL kinda meal.",2

4,My family ate here last night and thought the food and service were excellent.,2
3,"We hit Mr. B's Bistro for dinner the next night because the BBQ shrimp was supposedly the best in the area. I'm not sure if it's the cooking process (the waiter described that the shrimp were pan cooked in the BBQ sauce), but the shrimp had this really weird texture: they had no snap at all and almost a mushy texture. Normally, shrimp this large have almost a lobster texture. There was a good amount of shrimp in the dish and the bib they give you makes for a hilarious photo that I can''t post :-)We also tried the fried oysters which tasted great with the lemony sauce that was put on it.I had the braised rabbit since I hate taking shells off shrimp. This was cooked well and the sauce w/ tasso ham worked well w/ the mashed potatoes.After having dinner at Mr. B's and trying to figure out what to do for lunch on our last day, we decided to hit it for lunch on our last day. Unfortunately, it's definitely not as good as dinner. The jambalaya was ok but didn't have enough sauce. The stuffed pork chop was overcooked and oversalted and the pear stuffing didn't quite go that well with it (somewhat bitter?).  So it would have been 4 stars overall, but the lunch wasn't that great for me.Service was excellent however.",1
3,"I like that Sally's has more options for hair supplies than any other beauty store in the area. The staff is nice and friendly and everything is usually well stocked. Sally's is my go to when I feel like experimenting with my hair due to the wide array of products they carry. I do wish the staff was a little more knowledgable on what they carry but I understand that that's a lot to ask. I also wish that the store was bigger, brighter and cleaner. The cramped aisles, dust bunnies and flickering, yellow fluorescent lights don't exactly give that same ""beauty/trendy"" feeling that other beauty stores have. If I could give one piece of advice to management it would be to work on the appearance of the store, other than that I'm pretty happy with Sally's.",1
5,"I'm giving my visit to Aveda Institute a 5 for a series of reasons, and the price is definitely a factor.For $16, I was greeted promptly (promptly in my book at a salon is within 15 minutes of my appointment) by my student stylist, Miata. Miata is about the cutest sweetest thing north of Atlanta as far as I am concerned. She was talkative and had a lot of suggestions for what I could do with my hair. She also listened to exactly what I wanted -- and delivered. I have fairly course hair (for a white girl) and I don't treat it with much, nor do I blow it dry (on my own it never works). She cut a little less than an inch off (my guesstimation), feathered in fantastic layers, and then blew out my hair. I am extremely satisfied -- I normally can't have this type of a cut without spending upwards of $50. Definitely tip, but I think they pool tips, FYI. My bf has an appointment on Saturday, so I'll update then.",2
4,My first time - won't be last!!!  Smoky aromas hit you when you enter.  Everything is home made  my guest had the daily sausage sandwich. Excellent texture and flavour  my sandwich was filled with tender beef cheese and their homemade candied beets  large portions rustic decor. Open kitchen.   Vegans stay home although their roasted veg side dish was great!!!!I need to go back and try brunch! real meat. Real cooking. Oh and dark rye.  Yum,2
5,Great experience buying from Conicelli. Jacob our salesman was very attentive and did a great job finding exactly what I wanted.  I would highly recommend Jacob and Conicelli. He was a 10 out of 10,2
2,"Visiting my daughter at nearby college and she wanted some Japanese food. Yelp review brought us here.  My wife and I ordered Chirashi and it looked okay at first but sashimi slices were a bit thin and rice had very little sushi rice flavor.  Problem was the freshness. Fish didn't have any firmness to it and they smell fishy. My son's salmon wasn't fresh either. My daughter's Unagi Don was okay.  Misoshiru was watery and tasteless. If you like cooked items, lots of mayo, teriyaki sauce and lots of avocados, this is your place.   I would give service 3, overall food 2 and sushi or sashimi 1 star for freshness.",0
5,Best damn breakfast I've ever had. We had the roast beef debris biscuit with cheese sauce on top And stuffed French toast. The fruit was the best fruit I've ever seen and the homemade whipped cream on the French toast was out of this world. Fresh squeezed orange juice and a latte for the perfect end to this meal. We will be back!,2
4,"The atmosphere was nice and small. Very busy for brunch, expect at least a 30-45 minute wait. I recommend the spinach, caramelized onion and goat cheese omelet, but request a little less goat cheese. (this one was way too much, would have been better with 1/2 the amount).  Oh and the fruit was served perfectly ripe. Cash only.",2
5,"Nice Experience!!  We had quiche and Joe's scramble and a Lemmon muffin, all excellent.  The bottomless mimosas were wonderful and the waitstaff kept them coming.  Such a great start to Saturday.  The remodel was well worth the wait, the place looks fantastic!",2
5,"Awesome little dive. Visited on a Tuesday night and it was packed so I grabbed a seat at the bar.. Had a cup of seafood gumbo and blackened catfish with Randolph sauce. Both were excellent.. I will definitely visit here again.. Parking is limited out front, but there is plenty of room behind the restaurant",2
5,"This is a milestone review for me on Yelp.  I had been struggling with which one to chhose.  I decidede to make it Redemption.  This was seriously one of the best meals of my ENTIRE life.  This review was from about 2 months ago.  Sorry it is a little dated.  Such as life.  The setting is an old church.  It is really a beautiful surrounding for a restaurant.  Although I am an old church architecture nerd.  It was really cool to look around.   The service was incredible.  I was hear as part of a group of 7 other characters, several were part of the NOLA restaurant scene.  We wanted a good time with the meal and they provided it!   Paneed smoked soft shell crab a la Christian.  I was not fortunate enough to have enjoyed the original.  I can not comment on the faithfulness to the founders recipe.  I can say this there is no highe calling for a soft shell crab than to be cold smoked and fried in preparation for this dish.  On to your 77 virgins and mecca for you!  But I experienced heaven eating this.  Seafood stuffed filet of fish a la Christian's - This was superlative.  Again did not try the original, but the mirliton and seafood stuffing was heavenly, and more importantly improved the taste of the fresh flounder rather than competing for the spot light!   The combination was quite possibly one of the 10 best meals of my life.  If you have been here, you should try it!",2
5,"These guys were quick, respectful and fun! Big ups to Kiran! They were available on short notice and showed up on time, with a great price compared to others in the area. Highly recommended.",2
2,I truly expected more from a burger place owned by St. Elmo's and Harry and Izzy.  The restaurant felt more like a sports bar with all the TVs on and the pop music blaring so loud it made it difficult to focus on my date.  I got the Stanford (turkey burger) and zucchini straws.  The straws where much better than my burger that lacked any real taste.  My date got the Going Greek (lamb burger) and loaded potato salad and once again the side was better than the burger.  I've had better burgers for much less.  I will try it again with a more traditional beef burger to see if it was just the non traditional that didn't work for us.,0
4,"Spur of the moment decision to eat there last night - we dined in. Am happy we tried it. The steamed dumplings were delicious. The pork egg foo young was absolutely delicious. I could definitely taste it was fresh and made on the spot, not pre-made and frozen. For once, I could actually taste the egg. My husband had the pork lo mein, and he gave it a thumb's up. No, it's not NYC.... Come on people....accept that you live in Tampa Bay and judge accordingly. China City is not the prettiest of places, but hey, I find that holes-in-the-wall stay in business because the food speaks for itself.",2
4,"I have never found this market to be anything sensational except that when I need something not run of the mill like honey with the comb or something organic, I usually find it here.  They stock a lot of not seen everywhere items and the store appears very clean unlike a few in the neighborhood.",2
5,"Lowe's is our preferred home improvement store. The employees are always super friendly and knowledgeable, not only with helping me find where an item is located, but willing to listen to my project and offer suggestions on how I can get it done.What I really like about this location is their twice-a-month kid's workshops. The kits may be based on kid's movies, but the kids really like that, and the kits are fairly easy to put together. They are made out of real wood and have so far lasted through some heavy playing. The kits have stickers, but the base item can be painted instead, or once the stickers get ruined.I really like that this location sells ""sample size"" paint containers that you can get mixed to whatever color you choose. These 7-8 ounce containers are absolutely perfect for small craft projects (such as painting the resulting toy from the kid's workshop!).You can also have wood and PVC cut by an employee. I've never been charged for the cuts, although my requests have been fairly simple and straightforward. This is especially nice since we don't have any saws at our house, and no place to store any, either.",2
1,They send many jobs over seas to phillipines and india. Its hard to speak to anyone from usa.... Great service top of the line but cant see sending my hard earned American money over seas..... What a bummer....,0
4,The General Tso is definitely better than #1 but the dumplings are far worse.The chicken fried rice was decent and so was the lo mein. I may switch my standard delivery chinese to Royal Chef.,2
4,Happy is back!!Great to catch up with him again.  Here we are enjoying a freshly prepared dinner of goat curry and butter chicken.  DeliciousAnd of course .. Happy !,2
5,"It's surprising that you get as much food as you do for the low low cost that they charge.  I was hesitant to try my sandwich at first, thinking it must not be very good if it's that cheap.  I was Wrong!  This place serves some delicious sandwiches.  The only complaint I have is that they use bell peppers on almost everything and I'm allergic, but it's easy to order your sandwich without and so it is not a big deal.",2
1,Wait staff was pleasant but food took forever even though it wasn't remotely busy. Burger bun too soggy .....fries have a funky dust on them. Everything was super salty or greasy.   What is all the hype about?   Not cheap either.  Terrible.  Stay away.  Seriously.   BTW.  Two hours later and my husband and I are both feeling queasy. Thank goodness for Alka Seltzer,0
5,"I can't speak highly enough about the quality of service provided here.I stopped in on a Friday evening to get some links removed from a nice watch I'd recently purchased (from somewhere else). Literally the least profitable thing someone could come in for.The ladies minding the store were friendly and courteous, took immediate notice of me when I came in, and called John over to look at my watch.As for John himself? It's plain to see how much he loves what he does.He could easily just have swapped out the links as fast as possible, charged me $20, and been back to whatever he was doing before. Instead, he engaged me in conversation about the watchmaker, whether I owned any other automatic watches, what not to do while wearing it - apparently chain-sawing is a bad idea ;-) - whether to get a winder for it, how often to get it serviced (by the maker, not by him), how to minimize corrosion from salt water, who manufactured the movement, and more. After he was done, he pulled out a couple of nice watches from his own cabinet -- not to sell them, just to show how the different movements worked -- and told a few stories about other watches that had come through his door over the years.After I'd imposed on some 45 minutes of his time, he charged me less than he originally quoted me for the link removal, gave me a copy of a watch enthusiast magazine he had lying around, and sent me on my way with a smile. A perfect experience all around.",2
4,"Thoroughly enjoyed our dinner here a few weeks ago. Very cool atmosphere and love that you can byob or order wine there. Set menu of multiple courses, with the only option to choose if you wanted beef or lamb for the main course- we chose lamb. Every dish was flavorful and distinct. The belly dancer was fun and the other groups in our room were nice as well. Would definitely go back again.",2
1,"Hmmm let's just say avoid this cheesecake factory! Upon arrival they said it was going to 40 minutes for our table. That's perfectly fine it is a rainy night and I expected it to be a little wait. We walked around the mall and did a little shopping before they texted us to let me know our table was ready. When we came to check in the hostess informed us that our table was given away to a larger party but they were working on getting our table together now. Strike one! Don't text me to tell me my table's ready and then give my table away when I check in. I asked to speak to the manager and he also informed me that they made a decision to pull the table that were going to sit at to get the table ready for a party, but they would have a booth cleaned off soon.... That should have been my clue that it was going to be a sucky experience when the manager cosigns with a silly mistake.They finally got our table pulled together for us and we had a very friendly server from what it seemed. We ordered and waited and waited and waited. (Ok we will say it was because it is a busy night) Our food finally comes out and my Chicken Farfalle was supposed to have extra Farfalle sauce on the side. No Farfalle sauce. My friend ordered the steak Diane and shrimp scampi. Her steak Diane was supposed to be MW however it came out medium closer to medium rare. We informed our server that the steak was not cooked properly and I was still waiting on my Farfalle sauce. The server informed me that she ""just had not picked up the sauce yet and she would get it"". Strike 2. She brought me back my Farfalle sauce and let's just say it wasn't Farfalle more like Alfredo sauce. When I told the server it was Alfredo she took it sniffed the bowl and said ohhh let me fix that. She came back literally with the same bowl she sniffed and said ""this is the correct sauce the manager said it's the correct sauce"". I told her it was incorrect and I have eaten this many times. She proceeded to try and explain how it was the correct sauce. Strike 3! I am done. I know what this sauce taste like and that was not right. I will not be back here and please whatever you do just go to the one in Green Hills! The Green Hills Cheesecake Factory service is always good and the food is always great. I've tried this one about 4 times and it always ends up the same. I'm angry at the service and the food is never good. I'm sitting here at the restaurant writing this review so that in itself should let you know the level of frustration I have tonight!!!",0
5,"I asked the woman at the counter which sandwich she preferred and she said, ""The Wendy."" And then she revealed her nametag and it said Wendy! Okay, well, can't really argue with that. And I'm glad I didn't. That was a really good chicken sandwich. I had mine with grilled chicken and fresh garlic, in addition to the standard issue peppers and veggies. Dang, it was really good! The bread was soft, warm, and it soaked up the Italian seasoning with perfect absorbancy without going soggy. I cannot complain.My wife had a chicken caesar wrap which was also excellent. The dressing was creamy without being cloying and it had a nice garlic zip to it. This is the place to eat!",2
4,Always great... But I'm always impressed when the employees treat you great when you walk in 15 minutes before closing. My hat's off to the closing staff! Suggesting a new item for my wife to try was great. The Pad Thai is something I now have to try as I return.,2
3,"If you decide to eat here, just be aware it is going to take about 2 hours from beginning to end. We have tried it multiple times, because I want to like it! I have been to it's other locations in NJ and never had a bad experience. The food is good, but it takes a very long time to come out. The waitstaff is very young, but usually pleasant. We have just had too many experiences where we spent way too long waiting. We usually opt for another diner or restaurant on the weekends, in order to be done quicker.",1
5,"I didn't use to frequent the market often but my coworker made me go after work one day and now it has become our Friday treat after a long day at work!!! The chicken enchiladas are AwESOME!! No really!!! I'm hooked and the southwest chicken salad is good hot or cold, and bc I spread the word I have to buy it weekly before my mother in law gets it's, there nice here always helpful!! We tried the chicken taqutios today. Guess what. Also good. We will be back again n again great flavor:)",2
5,BEST MARGHERITA PIZZA EVER!! I originally tried this place after buying a Groupon 6+ years ago. My wife is a vegetarian so we tend to always get a Margherita. We were blown away by the freshness and flavor of our pizza. The crust is perfectly thin and the ingredients are always so fresh. I think we've ordered the veggie pizza before but it's hard to get anything but the margherita. I highly recommend giving this place a try.,2
5,"Hidden gem! We had a day out without any children, and went here. The bartender was super knowledgeable about their beers and offered samples for free. She took great care of us although she was really busy with a full bar. We ordered the chicken wings and they were delicious.  I was very impressed with our experience.",2
2,"Consistently the slowest checkout experience I've ever had. Literally at least 5-10 minutes per person, and longer if there's ANYTHING outside the norm (return, coupon, ship to home), which is then a 10-15 minute ordeal. Friendly staff, but that's not all it takes to create a great customer experience.",0
5,I was just visiting St Louis/Clayton for a business trip. I was referred to Sauce on the Side by a colleague. It is amazing to say the least. The food is fresh and creative. I ate there 3 times that week! Super friendly staff. They even gave me the low down on the local beers!  Love 4HandsBrewing by the way!,2
5,Probably the best breakfast cart on campus. Doesn't give sandwiches dripping with grease like some of the other carts (unless you order something that should be greasy). Quick and consistent as well. Price is about the same as similar carts.,2
1,"Totally non-dog friendly, unlike 95% of Manayunk.   Ashame since it's accross from the dog park.  I'll be giving my $ to the dog friendly Main Street Market from now on.",0
5,We brought our dog care for an emergency several weeks ago. Sadly our dog passed away but the vet stuff was so good and compassionate and did all the could. They were quick to treat her when we arrived and to do all needed tests to determine the problem. They were very knowledgeable in helping us make a decision as to what was best for our dog. We really liked the vet to the point that we asked if she sees regular visits and were bummed to find out she only sees emergencies. The team sent us a card and nice note after the loss of our dog. The cost was reasonable and actually less than I expected. Would definitely come back again.,2
5,"Mozzarella has been opened for a few months now and its reputation is growing quickly by word of mouth.  I can only speak for their pizza (which is the best on this side of town), but their menu consists of salads, pasta, subs, calzones, and so on. They delivery and do carry-out, but they have a nice seating area if you'd rather dine in. Free wi-fi and $4.95 lunch specials.Call first to see if they still have their carry-out special: a large one-topping pizza for only $7.99 or 5 toppings for $10.99!",2
5,"We've stayed at this Courtyard several times. The place is always very clean, the staff is friendly and helpful, and the location is convenient to shopping and interstates, but it's quiet. The food is also good, so I am sure we will be staying there again.",2
3,"The ride is quite boring but you'll learn about depth of water and the history of the boat and the city around just from listening to the operator talk.  The bars weren't fancy but it will do the trick.  It's the touristy thing to do and you should do it just because you're here and you might not get to do it the next time you're in town.  I suggest you do the lunch time tours rather than the night time ones because you'll get to see more of the scenery.  There isn't much to see when its pitch dark outside. Pros: You're a tourist, you like touristy things, take this trip.Cons: Boring.  But not quite a total waste of time.  I used this trip to recover from my hangover from drinking way too much the night before.",1
3,"This round-the-corner clothing version of the fabulous and famous Gravity Pope shoe store is similarly fabulous. The space is amazing and really fits the GP image. It's antiquey and trendy all at the same time, with creaky old wooden floors and and a gorgeous interior. I love how huge this shop is, too. It just keeps going and going!And of course, the clothes here are amazing. I'm a bag girl, and their leather totes, travel bags, and laptop bags are out-of-this world gorgeous. But for $800?  I just can't do it.I love the items and brands they carry, but I have yet to purchase anything from Gravity Pope, even though I love the store. It's just too darn expensive! Call me when they have a sale.",1
5,Carrot cake was amazing. Crave it every day since I had it. Doesn't even compare to previous cakes I've had.,2
5,"If you are willing to walk 3-4 blocks on the other side of canal... You will not be disappointed! Best place to eat so far!! Highly recommend!!  My husband and I enjoyed it so much that during a 5 day stay, we ate there twice!  Inexpensive dinner- total bill (for 2 people) minus alcohol $50.",2
4,They accept digital coupons!!! I love that everyone is always super helpful in person and on the phone. I was having trouble finding a few items for my project at home and was in need of pure Beeswax and i could not find it anywhere in Tucson and Michael's had it. Not only that but i had a 40% off coupon and was going to do 2 separate transactions to use the 40% off my most expensive item and they will automatically do this! AMAZING! I love this store and could definitely get lost in it - there are so many different craft ideas and items you wouldn't think of for gift ideas. The store is very clean and organized and staff is friendly and helpful. They also offer craft classes- definitely gonna look into that!,2
2,Service by our server was great. But the rest of the staff seemed to be more interested i. Each other than helping the servers that were swamped. Took 45 minutes to get cold hamburgers!,0
2,"Over priced and over hyped.  We were visiting Nashville and an internet search for restaurants showed this was one of the places to go to in Nashville.  We went for brunch.  I had a good feeling when we first when in and Zeppelins Over the Hills and Far Away was playing but that was probably the most memorable thing.  We didn't start off with the whippped feta, which seems to be the big thing there, maybe that's why we didn't have the same experience as other people.  I ordered the French toast cinnabon thing which was fine.  My wife however, had the Shakshuka and did not like it at all.  Too spicy in the morning, and as someone mentioned in another review, it would have been nice if that was mentioned (although it does say spicy on the menu, I think she was expecting a different spice).  Also, the poached egg to me was disgusting.  My wife used a spoon but could have drank it with a straw.  I think there were two, I give her credit for forcing down one, I couldn't have done it.  We also ordered a bloody mary  and a mimosa.  There wasn't much mimosa as far as volume goes and my bloody mary was a little thick, I think because of olive juice.  We each had side orders of bacon, two slices each at $5, and not like it was super thick.  Overall, the bill was about $80 and my wife was still hungry.  The waitress did notice that my wife hardly ate anything and mentioned getting the whipped feta saying it would help her stomach which was now hurting because of the spice.  She said no, but it would have been nice if the waitress had brought over a sample.  Anyway, like I said, about $80; $10 each for the mimosa and bloody mary, $14 for the three cinnabon french toast, $13 for the Shakshuka, $10 for four slices of bacon and whatever it was for the coffee (which was good).  I'm counting the tip so the coffee must have been up there too as well as the extra pita my wife asked for.  Listen, The Olive Tree Cafe in the Village in NYC has been there forever.  Check out their menu online and check out their prices.  They don't do breakfast, but if you're ever in NYC and get a chance to go there, do it.  It's fun, they have Charlie Chaplin movies playing, tables made of chalkboard to write on and great Middle Eastern food and great prices.  If you want pseudo hoity-toity, somewhat decent Middle Eastern food at an unrealistic price, then go here.",0
4,"Went yesterday on their second day of being open. It was packed! The staff is friendly and hardworking. Overall the food was great! I got one pound of snow crab and a pound of shrimp. The shrimp are huge! As far as seasonings, another customer recommended the Whole Shebang (Cajun, lemon pepper and garlic butter mixed together) it wasn't bad but a bit much. I would stick to one or two options. The food comes steaming hot in a bag. It was very fresh! Outside of boils they have shrimp, chicken and fish baskets. Corn, sausage and potatoes are also available a la carte. Overall great spot! Family friendly. A few kinks to work out with service but they have a great thing going!",2
1,Don't bother going.  The servers are too busy dancing to take your order.  Waited  30 minutes and never had our order taken.    But the servers danced two songs.,0
4,"My iPhone 6 screen cracked and the LCD was damaged.  I took my disabled phone in on a Sunday morning to have it repaired and I was told to come back in an hour.  I arrived a little sooner and my device was ready to pick up!  The replacement screen is beautiful and the staff was very helpful!  Only downside is that the touch ID no longer works. The manager DID offered a full refund and damaged screen to allow me to exchange my device with apple, but I declined.  I would definitely recommend this business to family and friends!",2
5,"My Wife & I have been wanting to visit Fiamme's since it's inception, but due to it's limited hours and the distance to drive from So AZ, it never happened.SO, when we had a Stay-cation in the Foot Hills, we jumped at the opportunity dine @ Fiamme's.It is located in a strip mall.  A long, deep and narrow venue with few tables; much reminiscent of Hanover Street in the Nahth End of Boston!The store is immaculate and the help is uber friendly.We got a simple Caprese salad that was divine, as was the bread served with it.The 13"" Carne pizza was amazing!  Several types of meats, a bit of cheese and a scant dolep of red gravy on a dough pie that literally puffed up around the outside into an airy, slightly burnt crust.The Owner, Mr. Scott Volpi was interacting with the customers as well as his staff.  He is a very personable young man! We wish him well!As I told him on the way out, my only regret is that we didn't come up from SE AZ sooner; we've been missing A LOT!",2
1,"Mediocre and expensive. I could not find prices listed anywhere when we ordered. This is also the first place I have ever encountered where a sandwich ""combo"" means with cheese, instead of a side of fries. They also charge you extra if you want gravy on the side. Roast beef ""combo"" was okay. It was tasty but very little meat compared to the HUGE bun. Onion rings were burnt. Fries were terrible. Mozzarella sticks meh. Oh and charged for peppers that I specifically said I didn't want but was given non the less. Will not frequent again, and I would strongly advise you to do the same.",0
1,"I've been here a few times, tried it one more time. Basically the food tastes like fast food of breakfast, not really impressed and the service is mediocre at best. Especially disappointed in the tiny pancakes. Sorry but I won't be dining here again.",0
5,"Can't say much more than has already been said, this is the place to get good consistent sushi.  Very friendly service, and once they see you a few times they call out your name as soon as you walk in the door.  I've been going to Osaka for years, and I've never been disappointed, they have a great sushi menu and Thai menu.  There's enough selection on the menu to satisfy most people that aren't big sushi fans.  The specialty sushi roll menu is huge, many original selections and combinations, though I would call these rolls, ""American Sushi"".  They also have a traditional sushi menu, and if you sit at the sushi bar on a slow evening, and they know you, they will let you come up with your own custom roll !  One of my favorite rolls is the ""Sexy Man"" along with the ""Fat Bastard #2"" yes these are real names of their rolls. About the only thing I could critique is the time to get your sushi order can take over 30 minutes on a really busy evening.  Still way worth the wait, and it gives you an excuse to order more sake !  They're going to be moving at the end of September because the strip center is being torn down for a big CVS, because there's not enough of them around.  It's probably a blessing in disguise because the current location decor is due for a upgrade.",2
1,"A 12 dollar burger and fries that were not even edible. Seriously, I used to enjoy this place but man has the quality taken a nose dive.",0
4,"I ordered a caramel macchiato and absolutely loved it. This was way better than Starbucks coffee. I liked their wrinkle fries, their sandwich was good and flavorful, and owner was very friendly. My husband and I both ordered a panini. I only wish I would find a menu online somewhere. They are a little hidden gem, so they should do their best to reach more people.",2
2,"They have dulled like their steak knives. Used to be a treat to go here and now it is just really expensive. Their target audience is clearly only people over the age of 60. There wasn't anything special about the appetizers or desserts, and unfortunately the cliche crab cake and chocolate lava cake were the only highlights. The old fashioned cocktail was a healthy pour, but the most lack luster of Indianapolis, and a featured drink on their menu too. I think the bitters were forgotten and the orange zest was just a small piece of torn off skin. The glass had a single large ice cube, but they brought out the bourbon in a decanter filled with small ice cubes. It was barely anything more than very very watered down bourbon by the time it was poured. Guess they only know how to serve wine. For entrees, I ordered the special, a dry aged New York strip, but it was totally overpowered by a thick pepper crust, which completely ruined the point of the dry aged flavors, for $60. To add insult, the steak knife was duller than  the butter knife, and I never had to work a knife that hard in a white linen.   The lobster tail for $26 was dried out and mediocre. The highlight of my wife's $50 salmon was the hollandaise sauce and side crab, the salmon itself was thin and uninteresting. We opted for the chocolate lava cake for dessert, which was the only thing worthwhile. The dessert menu was boring steak house safe bets: lava cake, cheese cake, berries and cream, creme brulee. Service was very good at least, although slow for being a quarter full on a Thursday night. Overall, a rather disappointing showing and it seems they have gone the way of Ruth Chris and outlived their Glory days. The dry aged steak dish was completely mis-designed and the menu is just as stereotypical unimaginative steak house as it gets. In hindsight, we probably could have had a far better, or at least similar experience, across the street for a hundred bucks less, not to mention whats available in half of downtown Indianapolis. For $250 for two, at least we have fond memories.",0
4,"I liked this place. Fish tank the size of one wall. Very relaxing. Seems upscale but casual. Was pleasantly surprised by all the food we ordered. No one was unhappy with their meals. From the kids popcorn shrimp, to the blackened fish tacos, to the grouper sandwich. Recommend this place for lunch. Did not try it for dinner so can't say.",2
5,"I brought my fur baby Vito to The Grooming Room for the first time on Saturday 6/18/16 and requested Rachel because of the reviews I read about her. I have my cosmetology license so I know a good cut even though I cut humans, I know when you get a quality cut or a shit one as I've been doing hair since 95'.  Rachel was very good. I am finicky about my baby's face and she cut it the way I requested. (I did tweek it a tiny bit but usually I have to clean-up the whole cut when I bring him home).  He looked and smelled wonderful.   I will be going back and Rachel will be the one I request again.  She really did the best job of any groomer I have ever brought him to. Thanks Rachel.",2
3,"Exactly as I expected!  Food is typical diner fare, but the staff are friendly and polite.  The kids loved it.  It was a good time for all.",1
4,"I mostly go here for Sunday School and the 5 for $5 happy hour. Good stop for a Sunday Funday.The wine and beers I have tried here have been pretty delicious, one stand out being a wine with hints of blueberry and white pepper, I wish I could remember the name!The food here is good and reasonably priced, cheeses are paired with simple but delicious accompaniments. Standouts include the arugula salad with beets and goat cheese, and a white bean and artichoke panino.Tria is a good place for a low key date or hang out with a friend.",2
4,"Atmosphere:  The craziness going on around you in Reading Terminal depends on the day and time of day that you go. It is really convenient that you can sit at the counter and get waited on there.Service:  The staff was upbeat and pleasant.  They were the ones who recommended we sit at the counter, which was a really nice experience.  We didn't feel rushed to get out of our seats.  It was really great that they offer you a sample of the food if you are unsure.Food:  Overall very good.  I was hoping for a bit more spice and strong flavors, but it seems like it is made marketable for the general population.  Which worked out fine with me because there were seasonings available on the counter to bump up the flavor profile.  I got the etouffee and bread pudding.  The etouffee was good, but the flavor got a little muddled after eating it for a while.  It didn't have the depth of flavor that I was hoping for.  The bread pudding was super delicious!  I would recommend it to anyone needing a sweet fix.  My friend enjoyed her jambalaya.Overall:  I would certainly come back.  The convenient location, good service, and yummy food are all definite pluses.  I am not sure that it is the best New Orleans place in Philly, but I am happy to partake of the menu again sometime soon.",2
5,"At $45, the prix fixe option is totally worth it. The foie gras soup is not to be missed. Service was attentive but not intrusive. Make a reservation before you go.",2
4,"Yummy fine dining mexian food. Portions are good, although plates could be $1-$2 cheaper and I would be a regular. The service is excellent, friendly, and they go above and beyond.",2
5,So amazing! Got VIP and skipped all the lines!!! So fast and better than howl-o-scream and Halloween horror nights! And half the price!!!!!,2
4,Staff was very friendly and helpful! Shower pressure was the best! Clean and tidy room. They welcomed our 2 tiny dogs w/ a small PD. Great place to stay for the price. I didn't go down to the continental breakfast... Hubby said it was a nice spread. Across the street we went to JonAs .. Had a blast!,2
1,"Arrived to restaurant and were informed we could sit at bar to avoid waiting for service.  We located seating at the high top bar which we were told would be adequately serviced. Our waiter approached asking if we wanted drinks and ordered water. After waiting nearly 20 minutes our waiter returned requesting our order, as she sat down menus.. We politely informed her that we did not receive menus and would need time to order. She indicated she would return in a moment to place our order. After another 10 minutes she returns and took our order. My salad was right however we were not provided utensils, which I had to go fetch myself. My husband also inquired if a specific game could be showed on the tv. Our waitress stated she would check and returns to tell my husband he would need to ask all 8 folks sitting at the bar if it would be okay to change one of the tvs that's showing the same things as 2 other tvs. The final thing that has disappointed me and caused me to waste my time to make this complaint is that 2 men who arrived nearly 5 minutes after us placing our order were provided their food (nachos) before us who also had ordered one nacho. Contacted management with no response! Nice atmosphere, HORRIBLE service!",0
4,"Ok my 4 stars are a little more biased than usual. First off, this hotel IS pet friendly. I mean they don't just accept dogs in the rooms, the staff are very friendly around the animals. Getting to the hotel with GPS was a breeze, but it took a couple seconds to figure out that there is an underground parking garage. It was a little scary and cramped for me and my family at first because we were towing a 4x8 Uhaul, but the hotel found a great parking space for me. The hotel is an older one, but it is decently maintained. The one thing that the Sonesta truly shines in is the food. I called in some room service for dinner and breakfast, and both times blew us away. Now if you're in New Orleans, chances are you wont' be checking out the cuisine of a hotel (Why?!?), but in our case our 3 yr old was sick and we couldn't venture out too much. This hotel had everything we needed, and a great staff to get it to us. All in all I give a solid 4 stars for staff, and service. The room was a bit small, the toilet had too much flush pressure so the water would spray out on every flush even with the lid down, and the thermostat was a little tricky. 4 solid stars though.",2
5,"This is a romantic, Italian restaurant! I was thrilled to get a booth next to the window on M street. I love to people watch. I loved the Cabernet the waiter recommended to go with a our wagyu steaks and tagliatelle pasta. That pasta was AMAZING!",2
5,We had another outstanding meal at J Gilbert's. Sunday is half price wine night so we started with a great red wine. The calamari appetizer was tender and delicious. We ordered 2 versions of the filet combo. One with crab cake and one with scallops. Both were excellent. Grilled asparagus was perfect and the Lobster Mac and cheese and the au gratin potatoes were decadent sides. You can't go wrong with any of the entrees here. I do not know why it wasn't busier!,2
4,Ordered a green hurricane smoothie that was delicious and the Mediterranean chicken with zoodles. Zoodles were delicious and flavorful and the chicken was a bit small but very tasty. Shared a salad as well that was absolutely huge and delicious with apples and beets! Felt full without the guilt! Great prices and cute set up.,2
5,This is the best place you are not going to. The decor is awesome and the staff is fantastic. Our waitress Madison and bartender Raquel were personable and took the time to find out what we wanted. Raquel even came to our table to make sure my margarita was right! The tequila list is extensive. Can't wait to go back for the Sunday brunch which is supposed to be out of this world. Do yourself a favor and go to this place ASAP!,2
5,"The all you can eat is amazing. Try a little bit of everything and have as much as you want. For $20 you definitely can't beat the price, and the food is creative and there's plenty of variety. Definitely worth checking out.",2
2,"Should give them 1 star for the quality of the work but I will give them 2 because they were able to take me as a walk-in. I wanted to get acrylics and since they did plain ole acrylics (unlike the 2 other salons I previously went to), I sat down and let the lady go to work. Halfway through she informed me that they would be $60 plus $5 for a french tip, so I might as well just get the gel for $70. For $70, these acrylic nails should be able to give me magical powers. Instead, they are uneven, transparent enough that my nail bed shines through, and cracking 2 days later. It took an hour and a half, they switched girls in the middle of the process and the quality is appalling. I highly suggest going to another nail salon in the area.",0
5,Fantastic restaurant!  Consistently great food and atmosphere!  Great place for a catered party or a romantic evening with your wife!,2
4,I love to explore local small businesses and this one was a great find. It's a very nice small cozy and super clean neighborhood coffee and crepe restaurant. Staff is very friendly and their crepes are amazing. I tried the Honey bee which was good with mochachino. The prices are pretty affordable. It wasn't super busy on a Saturday morning.,2
5,Great haircut - needed a quick shape-up for seminar at Rutgers. They came through - highly recommended.,2
3,"Walk around inside and soak up the history. Talk to the guy selling shirts outside, he has some amazing stories to tell. They love jazz there and you can see it in their eyes. People who don't even like jazz walk away after spending some time there and talk about the fun and newfound appreciation for this American creation. Wear loose clothing in the summer and try to ignore just how BAD everything around the area smells. It's worth it.",1
4,"Stayed here for work and it was the only place in town that had availability. Check in was a breeze and my room was nice. Free tea and coffee and very clean and fresh smelling room. Lobby was large and open. Breakfast buffet is an option that I took advantage of two days ($16.95), it would be nice if breakfast could be included like other hotels in the area. Parking is expensive $38 a day, bit work is paying so no harm to me. Close to the ballpark and Washington street where all the bars and restaurants are. Walking distance to the arch. I think I'll try another hotel next time.",2
4,"Visited today for lunch and it was pretty yummy. The restaurant is located right by the beach so parking can be an issue, but luckily we found a spot right away. I had the Hickory Burger, and my boyfriend had the grilled chicken sandwich. The prices are fair  (it was $28 for the two of us). There is a wonderful seating area which makes you feel like you're in a friends backyard. There is also a great play area for kids. Definitely worth a visit!",2
3,"Friendly staff, but disappointed in what I got. My grilled cheese's bread was burnt. For $6 (and .48 because I used my credit card) I was expecting better.",1
1,"I used the mobile app, the bill was for $31  and I asked a friend to pick  it up.The store refused to give her the order because I was not there with my Card. I'd done this at least 6 times before without issue.  So I understand that TBELL is trying to watch out for my money.  not letting anyone steal using my account   So why then did they still charge me the $31 even though I never received the food.  Who is it I'm being protected from  hackers or Taco Bell itself.  I'm out $31I've attempted to contact TBELL but I'm not able to get through to them.",0
5,"Freshii is an awesome place for a quick HEALTHY meal.  We found this hidden gem close to our office and are so excited to have fresh, delicious and healthy options for a quick lunch or even be perfect for a little meetup with friends.  The inside is clean and bright, with the walls covered in foliage, giving it a fun,semi-tropical kind of feel. They also have outside seating w/ umbrella do it is PET FRIENDLY and lets us enjoy the beautiful Florida sunshine.Now to the food....there were so many options and variations, is was almost impossible to choose.  But the helpful staff was very knowledgeable about the different dishes and helped steer me in the right direction.  I went with the Pangoa, and it was DELISH!  It was picture perfect actually. Brown rice topped with fresh avacado, cilantro and cherry tomatoes, roasted corn, black beans, chicken and drizzled with a tangy ""spicy"" BBQ sauce (not so spicy for my tastebuds). I'm literally craving it as I type this....My friend got the Cobb salad and he couldn't stop raving about it. Everything was fresh, crisp, delicious and fast!  Also, a greats option for VEGANS, as the have tofu and falafels for all meal options. They also had a huge array of smoothies, a juice cleanse and breakfast options!!!  I could see this being a one stop shop for someone in the go who trying to add few more healthy options to their repertoire.  Freshii is defiantly going to be a staple in my busy work week.",2
5,We spent about 3 hours here today with our 14 month old grandson. He had a blast! There are plenty of picnic tables and shady areas. All the children were mindful of him as he ran around in the water play area. It was pretty busy but it's spaced out so well that we never felt like we were in the crowd.  He also loved walking out on the pier.  We live in  Sarasota and I wish we had a park this beautiful. We will go back.,2
1,"Sat down over a half hour, only miso and drinks served. Waiting for actual food ordered or someone to cook it ....waiting ...",0
5,"Reservations Gourmet- to-Go is often overlooked at as a Seminole Heights eatery but shouldn't be. Reservation offers up a convenient service for those without the time to cook. The kicker is, that if you have been to Reservations you'll crave it even when you have time to cook.  Reservations serves quality home cooked meals to-go and their weekly specials are huge deal for those that are budget conscious.Not only is Reservations good but they are also locally owned and operated. The owners Anthony and Elke live here in Seminole Heights and make everything from scratch.One order will usually serve a two people.  We have ordered 2 meals which easily served four people and we still had leftovers.  The order pictured to left included:Yankee Pot Roast, fork tender beef slowly cooked with carrots, onions, green beans and potatoes for $11.95Chicken Rustica,  boneless breast sautéed with crushed red pepper, garlic, capers, olives, tomato and Romano for $11.95The Yankee Pot Roast was good but the Chicken Rustica was fantastic (BTW I am a fan of olives) . The mashed potatoes are great and the salad's are above average. Other hits include the Chicken Marsala and the Meatloaf. Reservations also carries vegetarian dishes such as the Polenta Lasagna; polenta layered with portobellos, parmesan, mozzarella and pomodoro sauce.Reservation's specials change weekly. Make sure you sign up for their e-mail list which is on a clipboard on the front counter.There is seating at Reservations and its a popular lunch spot for those looking for a great sandwich.  The hot sandwiches are a must try. Topping the hot sandwich list are the Hot Meatloaf Hoagie and the Buffalo Chicken Finger Sub for $7.95 each.If you want to splurge a little you should try a piece of cake which will cost you $4.50. The Cheese Cake is a hit among neighbors but I have to give my personal recommendation to the Carrot Cake. I am not a fan of carrot cake but the Reservations version kicks ass.",2
4,"This place has a really nice outdoor covered patio...great service, good food...usually willing to accommodate food allergies.",2
5,Always a great time coming here! Some of the cheapest soft serve in Tampa but they also have a variety of other options too such as sundaes which my dad loves. I always get the vanilla soft serve dipped in chocolate and it never fails. I've been coming here for years with friends and family and I have so many good memories here which always makes it a pleasure to come back! The service is super fast and it was really packed tonight so props to them for getting our orders out fast and correctly.,2
5,Le Rendez-Vous is the perfect restaurant for those who enjoy the finer things in life. From duck l'orange to an authentic Grand Marnier Souffle every course looks and tastes of the time and care put into it by the chef. They also have a very impressive wine list. The waiters are attentive without being to intrusive and the atmosphere is very pleasant.,2
5,"Have ordered take out from here twice. This is one of the two best Indian restaurants I've been to in Bucks County (the other being Cafe Bombay in Bristol) -- everything tastes fresh, and you can taste the ingredients (as compared with so many places where the meals basically just have one note). Highly recommend this place.",2
4,"Amazing pizza I think it has won me over from my previous favorite (five points pizza - also veryyy good.) I've taken my boyfriend, parents, and friends here and they have all enjoyed it. If you're looking for a good pizza spot in Nashville this is it!",2
4,"When I'm near this spot and its lunch time, this is where I grab a bite. Super friendly people and the sandwiches are great. Love the turkey with white sauce. Wish they had a sit down place, but I will continue to grab lunch here, highly recommend.",2
3,"Sometimes it's the little details that can make or break a good restaurant to be a great one. My 3 Stars easily could have been 5 if for one little detail. Salad Dressing! My wife ordered the Chicken Caesar Salad and I had a side salad with Blue Cheese Dressing with my Fantastic Hamburger. The Hamburger was pure perfection. The 1/2 lb patty was juicy, cooked med rare with grilled onions and cheddar cheese. One of the Best Burgers I've eaten. Oh yes the Dressings. I asked the server if the dressings were home made in the restaurant. He's was so proud to say yes they were. Little did he know that the dressings he and his kitchen think are so wonderful are actually terribly horrible. The Caesar Dressing was an Oily Based concoction that was so over powered with anchovies and garlic my wife could not stand eating it. I couldn't either. My Blue Cheese Dressing was so over ripe that after one bite I couldn't eat anymore. With so many great dressings available to purchase from Sysco or US Foods I'm always so surprised that restaurateurs insist on making their own thinking theirs is better. Let's just say Ken's, Marzetti or Girards dressings are all available from their local foodservice company that come with great consistency and are shelf stable.The restaurant itself is very nice & relaxing. A block off the main drag of State St also adds to the quaintness. I would definitely go back although I wouldn't order anything that requires a dressing.",1
5,"A true hole in the wall with authentic middle eastern wraps. I love to go to this place, I used to go more often about 5-10 years ago but I got the chance to revisit a month or so back, boy didn't I miss it!I had the Mediterranean wrap, amazingly well done and cut meat to perfection with all the necessary adds on (such as feta, grape leaf dolma) to make sure all the middle eastern flavors dance in your mouth. I enjoyed it so much. The portion is perfect, not to big, not too small. You want to top that with a really awesome desert, you have to try the pistachio burma.... God I am coming to you.",2
3,"Love the juicy steaks and fantastic service. Be weary, though that medium-rare is very rare. Almost raw. I learned this from my first time and consequently order medium from them on which was perfect for me. The sides are yummy and complement the steaks. This place is a bit pricey but worth the splurge.One time, the waiter came back to return a tip because we didn't notice they already added gratuity to our large party. We thanked him and only took back part of it. That was very nice of him to do.",1
5,"This is my favorite place to buy house plants as well as outdoor plants. They have very knowledgeable and friendly staff as well. I also really love the gift store that has everything from all kinds of garden supplies to candles, lotions, indoor and outdoor home decor. Its hard for me to not find something that I do not like in this store and nursery. Great for buying gifts for others.",2
5,"Fantastic customer service, did a great job on my screen and expert install of new screen protector.  I'd say, move over Apple Store!",2
5,"Good hearty breakfasts. As a friend once said, ""if you leave there with any folds in your stomach it's your own d... fault. """,2
5,"For years I've been purchasing my daughters yellow roses for their birthdays; one stem for every year old.  They are17 and 19 now,  so you can imagine how expensive this could get.  I shopped around and found that The Flower Place consistently has the best quality roses and at a much better price than their local competitors. I HIGHLY recommend you check out The Flower Place, first. Don't let the old gas station exterior fool you. You'll be glad you did.",2
3,"The chicken and the ribs entrees were overly-salty. I like my foods full of flavor, but not salt. But still it was pretty good, and the parking lot was convenient. The sides were good though.",1
5,"This place was soooo unexpectedly delicious!! We had Charred Carrot Hummus, Shabazi Fries, Bean Fattoush, Roasted Cauliflower and the Bean Tagine. Every dish was flavorful, inventive, fresh and amazing!! Kudos to the chef and owner!! Definitely coming back.",2
5,"Love this place. My partner and I go all the time. The food ( thanks, in part, to James in the kitchen) is consistent and so good. My partner is addicted to the Rueben. I change around a lot but the burgers are fantastic. We prefer sitting at the bar and always get great service, we especially like Claire. Beautiful job on the decor. Bathrooms are always clean. This place is a great addition to the neighborhood and an asset to our community.",2
5,Excellent choice for fresh Greek cuisine. I had the Chargrilled Lamb Plate with Greek salad and rice and my wife had the Chicken Gyro with grilled vegetables. Delicious marinade and seasoning on both and portion size was healthy for the price.,2
5,"Super yummy place!  Easy to miss if you aren't from the area.  We had waffles, scrambled eggs, and a breakfast burrito at our table, and everything was superb.  My son and I had something called the wildflower triple that had scrambled eggs, bacon, and a waffle.  The waffles were very yummy were tender with the perfect golden crisp to them.  The bacon was a great balance of crispy without being over cooked.  Prices seemed reasonable to me, most items in the $5-8 range if I remember correctly.  Mine was $7.75 I think.One last note is that they had good portion sizes.  The portion sizes are filling, without being super sized.  I was afraid when I order something called a triple it would be WAY too much food (even though the price was inline with other items on the menu).  It was two eggs, two pieces of bacon, and a deep pocket waffle the size of a coaster.  If you like huge portions of food look elsewhere.",2
1,"My first visit and my last. Just spent $21.00 for fried oysters and fries. Fries were the best part of the meal (ketchup was okay). They presented 8 little balls of fried crust covering the smallest, mushy oysters. I eat 3 hoping it would get better but the 4th was mush and foul.I told the waiter and he said he was sorry. I paid the bill. Lesson learned but it was not cheap.",0
5,"Been going since opening.  Beer is amazing, great quality, better taste!  Food trucks too.  Enough said.",2
5,Yo this draft latte is BS good. Also the guy at the register complimented my tie. 10/10,2
4,"I Love Gia's pizza and will officially say that I am addicted! The sweet red sauce that is on their pizza, the huge salad with the pepperoni, bacon, green peppers, red onions, mushrooms, and croutons, and the stuffed bread breadsticks are my faves. I actually have replicated the salad and sauce at home and am going to make the bread sticks some day. I just can't afford to eat there every week like I would like to! Gia's is good at any time, but I love lunch in the early summer or late fall so I can sit outside and enjoy the weather and their lunch specials. It's also a good place to watch games since they have lots of TV's. Not really good for groups of more than 6 or 8 due to the size. For those of you who ate here when it was Papa Vito's, don't worry the menu hasn't changed. Also, for those of you who've tried Papa Vito's in Belleville since they opened, stick with Gia's Pizza. Easier to get to as far as parking and the one-way streets in Belleville, Gia's puts enough sauce on the pizza whereas Papa Vito's Belleville skimped on it, Gia's smells nicer and it's easier to get into the building carrying a baby at Gia's. (Guess I need to review Papa Vito's in Belleville next)The only reasons I am giving them four stars and not five is because I can only rate the pizza, bread sticks and salad since that's all I ever get there.",2
4,"It's a Walgreens. It's a chain. It's in my hood. Being in my hood, is reason enough to bump them up a star. Actually, the extra star is my Christmas gift to them. Because, their great sales made my budget for ""Secret Santa"" at work go further. I wasn't even looking here and found a perfect gift as I entered and it was 50% off. More gifts, the merrier the recipient. I am also a fan of their photo lab. It is so easy to submit pictures via the Walgreens app. Once my photos are ready to pick-up, they'll text me. Then all I have to do is jump in the car and drive up Hampton a couple of blocks. It usually takes less then two hours and the quality is good. I don't use the pharmacy, but this is my go-to for over the counter drugs. The prices are good and I've never seen them out of stock for any of the products I use. It is a busy Walgreen's as everyone has stated. So have patience when it is time to check-out. Management is quick to open additional registers when a line starts to form. Will I return? - I support my hood, even if it is a chain store. When: December 13, 2017Why: Photos and Secret Santa Shopping",2
5,"Excellent shrimp and grits for breakfast! A nice spicy barbecue taste to it. My husband had the Boudin omelette and it was good but the boudin wasn't crisp and was  and he thinks that would've been better, but the hashbrowns were phenomenal.",2
4,"Excellent location!!   This hotel sits kitty-corner from Independence Hall entrance, right across the street from Liberty Bell and a stones-throw from many other historical significant sites in Philadelphia.  It is also an easy stroll to Penn's Landing, South Street and two blocks down from Market and 5th SEPTA station.  The rooms are the traditional Monaco decor with lots of bold wall coverings and period furniture.  Bathrooms are also nicely done with excellent water pressure and upscale finishes including free-standing tub and separate walk-in shower in the Spa King room.  Staff was very friendly and helpful as well and who can't love the daily coffee service in the morning and wine-tasting in the evenings.  My ONLY complaint would be the alley-facing rooms has to deal daily with the trash and delivery trucks at 6:30 AM sharp.  Would suggest management push to make this happen at some other time of the day.",2
5,This place is where the former Pollo Loco used to be next to the launder-mat. I'm always in search of the best breakfast burrito and this place has it. Delicious homemade flour tortillas made daily along with a fresh salsa bar with 4 different salsas to choose from. They offer daily specials too! I'll definitely be back for lunch & dinner.,2
5,"We tried two varieties of pizza and both were excellent. Easily some of the highest quality pizza I've had in South Jersey.   The owner John was there and was warm and friendly.  The actual facility is immaculately clean.  With all the mediocre pizza places on every corner, it's great to find a place that uses high quality ingredients.  You can absolutely taste the difference.  I highly recommend Organico.",2
5,Was here about a month ago. The food here is great but the waitress we had was terrible. She stood at the bar...saw every move we made and did nothing. We waited for our appetizer....waited for our main course.... waited for her to notice we were done. Then it was like she was doing the world a favor by waiting on us. I had been here several times. I left her no tip.The stars for the food.... no stars for her.,2
5,"I have to start out by saying, why do those who like hookah not know about this place?! It was such a wonderful experience! Please hear me out!My mission on this review is to get the word out! A friend and I went spur of the moment and I'm glad we did. From the outside of the building you wouldn't know it was a hookah bar (except the giant sign of course lol). The moment you open that giant wooden door, the decor and paint color gives it that authentic look. Warm yellow paint with evil eyes and giant metal wall lamps with cutouts shining red surrounding all the walls.When you go up a few steps there's a gift shop, a table, and the register. They ask you to take a seat upstairs and they follow you shortly after. (There's even another upstairs that I barely peaked at).This is the amazing part: cushions on the floor with giant metal mandala tables!!!! It was so authentic I could barely handle my excitement. They have a menu with drinks, food and hookah. Water was only a dollar which was amazing because hookah bars are usually pretty pricy.We smoked ""sex on the beach"" flavored shisha. It was smooth! Very smooth! We even brought bubbles for the trip to have a little fun :)What I like about this place compared to other loud hookah bars is that it wasn't even close to being hectic. I felt like I should have whispered at first, but after awhile I was more comfortable. Only one other couple was there and they were very nice to talk to as well. The older man and the young guy was extremely nice. The younger dude checked in on us and was sociable which was really kinda nice but not overbearing. If you want a low key, quiet and chill hookah bar, this should be at the top of people's lists.",2
3,"This place is good. For the lofty prices the proportions were very small. However the drinks were cheap and the service was very good. The piano is a nice touch as well. The cheesecake is incredible, just get it and don't look back.",1
1,"I took an 8 year old and a 14 year old for the lunch special pizza.  We have done this on several occasions, and the kids love that they each get their own personal pizza, made the way they like.   They both ordered their pizza with 2 items and wanted BBQ sauce as the base instead of tomato sauce.  (this is the only way they enjoy pizza).   I was told that they could only get tomato sauce, not BBQ sauce.   I explained that we have gotten it this way several times before.   We were told that they don't offer it this way any more.   I see that some of the pizzas offer BBQ sauce and pointed it out, but again was told that it couldn't be made this way for them.   I asked if I could pay additional to have it made with BBQ sauce, but once again told it was not possible.   Sadly, we left the restaurant and chose a different nearby restaurant for lunch.  I'm sorry to say I won't be able to take the kids here anymore.",0
3,"Came in here on a Friday night not really expecting much but to watch the Sixers game. They had a few drink specials, none of which really appealed to me. The mixed drink I got seemed really weak. However, at around 9pm the bartender ABSOLUTELY BLASTED the music to the point where my mate and I paid our check and promptly had to leave. We could still hear the music playing all the way down the street. I don't know if they do that to lure people in or scare them away. I prefer other bars in the neighborhood...",1
5,"I had an awesome experience at Champs today. I told the groomer how I wanted Harley's haircut and she did it exactly as requested. And it looked fabulous. In addition, the groomer, manager, and Pat all courteous and helpful. I also had the opportunity to see the dogs out back during our playtime. Backyard is so big they have more than enough space to run around and have fun. I would highly recommend them for grooming and boarding. And I look forward to seeing them again.",2
2,They are kind of skimpy on their ingredients for the price you're paying. The chicken in my jerk chicken taco was undercooked as well.,0
5,"Great food, amazing service! This is a hidden gem in the area. I hope more people go here!!",2
5,"These hand grenades don't play!! Thy definitely do the job for $12! I would rather much have these than hurricanes. They taste more citrusy and pack a more sour punch. Because they're delicious and refreshing tasting, it'll keep you addicted. By the end of the bottle you'll be swirled up!!",2
2,"I don't understand why Yelp has two separate listings for the same restaurant? Oh well ... my review covers them both:It is sad but seemingly true that this place has survived for years on the overflow traffic from some of the other places at John's Pass. Tired of the wait at Bubba Gump? Not in the mood for pizza from Delosa's? Just realized that you paid for parking and that Walt'z has closed for the day - plus your feet hurt from a day at the beach ... stop for a while at Sculley's and take what they serve you. If you can find a server, that is. Actually, the service isn't that bad ... the problem is with the layout of the place. The shops here want to have an eclectic air, as though they were built from driftwood and shipping crates held together with sail cloth and rope. This is fine in fantasy, but in reality does not make it easy for the wait staff to get around easily of remain within eye sight of their tables. The food is passable, but unexceptional. Being a stone throw away from Gulf of Mexico means that a restaurant can lean towards basic tourist fare (they likely won't know how boring it is) and get away with it. Locals tend to shy away from such places, unless they are entertaining out-of-townees who believe boat drinks and breezes are more important than fine dining.",0
4,"What can I say, this is the train station.  The bathrooms are clean, it is a huge space, and there are plenty of little places to grab a snack or a beverage.  It is way better than Penn Station in New York City!",2
5,"You will have to stand in line, you will have to squeeze onto a wooden bench with a lot of strangers, you will not have heat or a/c and .... it is worth it.  This is such a fun jazz show and such a cool space - you have to try it at least once and I am betting that if you go once, you will go again.  This place is legendary!",2
5,"I have been going to Mimosa for waxing for a few years now. I have always had a good experience and left a happy customer!I was in over the weekend for a wax and realized the next day that there was still some hair left behind, so I left a voicemail with the issue on a day they were closed. I was pleased when they contacted me bright and early the next business day, and promptly got me in for a touch-up wax, free of charge.Very pleased with how they handled the situation, I will continue going there for years to come!",2
4,"This target is conveniently located and has what we are looking for.  There is a large parking lot so no need to worry about finding a spot to park.  We can get in and out quickly, and those are the main things I look for at Target.",2
5,Stopped in right after flying in and this will probably now be my first stop coming out of MSY from now on. Fresh bread for the sandwich and quality stuff!,2
1,"Friendly service but the food isn't worth eating. I tried to sample everything to try and find something to at least fill me up for a meal, everything is over cooked to the point where it's hard or rubbery. Ended up just getting a box of cereal. 11.99 each person, would have been better off eating at the sit down spot in silver legacy",0
2,"We always like to check out the neighborhood restaurants and lend support to the local businesses, so we checked out lunch at KC Barbecue. One of my favorite bbq items is brisket, so we were thrilled that they had a bogo special on the brisket sandwich. For $8.50 we were served a small, tender, but tasteless sandwich without any side items. There were the usual squirt bottles of three typical bbq sauces. Nothing unique. We added on a small side of bbq beans that were actually kidney beans, for $2.25. The side was disappointing, but maybe it was my fault for expecting some pieces of pork like you normally get at a bbq restaurant. Maybe the kidney beans are typical of KC. On a tasty note, we enjoyed their Corn Bites ($4.50 for 6) a battered and deep fried ball of corn, with a tamale flavor. We are taking this restaurant off our list of places to go.",0
1,"I have no idea why this pretentious, dirty place is so popular... If you like terrible service, over priced wine, junky lawn chairs, and cock roaches crawling up your arm, you should definitely go here. Otherwise, you should save your time and money and go anywhere else.",0
4,Would have been a 5.   Food was excellent. Ambiance is well-designed.  Hostess fit the cool vibe.  Bartender seemed a bit bothered but drinks were nicely crafted (when I was finally noticed).  Great care went into making  the cocktail but it floored me that the ice  was the kind  you get at the machine in 7-11.  Kudos to the chef though; Cant get this authenticity in NY...and the value is incomparable.,2
5,Best ice cream in New Orleans!  I personally love the chocolate peanut butter and fudge.,2
5,"Well, I don't know why would anybody give this shop less than 5 stars! It is my first time visit and my very first tattoo and let me tell you, was I worries? YES, but guess what- Chaz made it super easy and smooth so I barely felt any pain and I love love love my new tattoo! I will post the pic later after the healing process will be completed just because I want you to see the beautiful art work Chaz did for me! Shop is very clean, everyone is very friendly ,knowledgeable and Chaz is definitely very passionate about his work.I would definitely recommend and will be back for the second tattoo .Thank you, guys you are all awesome and made is so easy for me to make up my mind with the tattoo!",2
5,This bar was created for guys. Great place to hang out with friends. Heard the burger was the best in the city. Tried it out and it was amazing. Make sure you order the duck fat fries too. If you're in Philly this is the place to go to. 5 stars,2
1,"Owner and Manager, Pay attention. Hotel Across the Street Fairfield Inn, wanted dinner before checking in decided Denny's would be perfect.This Denny needs help, Gentleman sat me and my Family down and told us someone would be with is shortly. Almost 15 minutes later no one came over, I saw a female one Table away as she dropped off items but then she scooted away. I saw a Family arrive, and the Waiter that sat us down help this family, taking their order and bringing them drinks.I told my Family let's go, I know we are tired and hungry but they don't value our business. As we got up, all 8 of us one even made an attempt to perhaps stop us even acknowledge us. So sad... We ended up at Wendy'sIf you don't change your ways, Travelers wi ll write you up for poor Service and eventually you business will fail.I might even Contact Denny's Corporate to share my Experience. You accross the street from Major Hotels.Think about changing or sell the place to someone who cares.",0
1,"Horrendous customer service I ask if their is any promotion to switch from my carrier to theirs, crickets... They act like they're doing me a favor to switch to their service.",0
4,"Pretty good food, service could've been better but I'm not one to complain especially if the food is good.",2
4,"The bartender Michael, the house made spirits and beer, and the great food (a ruben and a Depot Burger saved the day).  They were severely understaffed at 2pm on a Saturday but Michael was busting his butt and that made the situation all the more tolerable.  We will definitely be back again; hopefully the staffing issue was a one off.  P.S. Don't miss the opportunity to try the BBQ sauce they serve with the sweet potato fries ;)  As my my husband said, it's ""stupid good"".  Unfortunately they didn't have a gallon to sell me!!!",2
4,"It was whispered this was some of the best Ice Cream out there. I can NOT dispute this fact.  I splurged and got myself a single scoop of Mint Chip. The scoop was HUGE. I mean -HUGE- The flavor was delicious and it was so creamy! It was a delight in my mouth!I also ordered a large cappuccino. While it wasn't the perfect cuppa, it was a decent cup of rich java, and that's just what I wanted with my ice cream. I would reccomend this place to anyone.",2
5,"I was here on the soft opening day (11/18). The official opening is on 11/21. Drinks were buy one get one. They were handshaking all the drinks so it took a while. Our order was after a big group one so it took 30 minutes to get our two orders. They are still working things out so it's understandable. The boba here are are very unique. They are clear and jelly like in texture with a hint of something fruity. It was a refreshing change. They appear to specialize in foam milk teas. I ordered a standard boba milk tea, which is the equivalent of ordering chicken tenders and fries at a restaurant. It was okay but the boba made it worth it. My sister ordered a boba Sakura oolong tea without the foam. She enjoyed it very much and will be coming back. The decor of this place is super cute and I would rate it the cutest bubble tea in Chinatown. The owner is also very friendly and nice.",2
5,This is a great spot to get a well priced lunch that comes with soup and spring rolls. This is the best Thai food I have had in Edmonton and the service is always quick and attentive.,2
4,"What, no line for Sunday brunch!?  Awesome.  Just make sure you get there before the 11am rush.  Excellent coffee choices, ie medium or dark.",2
5,"This is my new favorite restaurant! Everything was absolutely perfect from the drinks, to the food, to the service. Our server Veronica was so helpful and good at describing things, and seemed to really care. Mediterranean meets Southern and some of the best food I've had in a long time. Definitely the most memorable service.",2
3,"Don't get me wrong, the donuts were delicious, but I thought the process was extremely difficult. When you go to a ""make your own"" donut joint you go for the experience, and their clip board was not doing it for me. The amount of items on the clipboard seemed overwhelming and I was instantly confused. I was also extremely disappointed that you could only get one topping. I was really excited to let my almost two year old load up his donut as a special treat, come to find out he could only add sprinkles. The donuts were tasty, but in my opinion it isn't worth a drive. The experience just didn't do it for me.",1
5,This is my favorite steakhouse in Sparks/Reno area.  A great hidden treasure.  Full of suprise and what a great dining experience.  So far a cut Above the rest of the areas steakhouses.,2
5,"Ordered the coconut curry ramen and it was so delicious. The broth was extremely flavorful, and savory. Party in my mouth!",2
5,"Emilio Valsecchi has been my mechanic for well over 10 years, he's  meticulous in the attention and care of his work. his skills vary from domestic to the most difficult Import vehicles. if your looking for an honest mechanic...i highly recommend Emilio, he takes wonderful care of my Land Rover.",2
4,"Nice atmosphere, good place to have dinner or drinks with a few friends. Vegan pulled 'pork' was not superb but pretty OK",2
5,Pretty much the best Italian restaurant in the entire Philly area.Went there for lunch today. Excellent bread. I asked for garlic my wife no garlic. They brought out two full bowlsBruschetta was real good. Toasted longhots stuffed with prosciutto were killer!I had a HUGE portion of angel hair with hot sausage. I could only finish half it was so big. My wife kept stealing mine while she ate gnocchi in vodka sauce that she said was great. It's a small place on the outside but has a big dining roomYou can't go wrong at this place!,2
4,"Just a treat to go here. A very unique dining experience. We stopped off on the way to wine tasting in Los Olivos and had a lunch. It was Sunday and they were BBQ tri-tips outside, so naturally we ordered those. I also sampled their venison chili. Both dishes were quite good. I found the venison chili a bit under developed in terms of the chili and spices, good but as if they had not had ample time to really settle in and develop. The tri-tip was excellent but the sandwich was a tad  basic and underwhelming. However the service and the setting is so fantastic and so superb, it's an old cabin that was a stop for travelers back when, that this pushed the rating to a 4. Bring the food up a notch and it would be a 5 in my books. Definitely worth going to but it can get really crowded, which is a good sign but you might have to be prepared for a wait. No problem, hang out in the canyon under the trees and let the day take you!",2
4,Made an online reservation and was seated promptly. Seat was for four and they put two tables together near the bar. It was noisy but that's to be expected on a Saturday night. Our server was wonderful and the food arrived on time. We had three chicken and one veg entrees. The food was absolutely delicious. I highly recommend street noodles with some chefs hot sauce. But make sure to get a reservation or you'll have to wait 30mins.,2
5,Terrific experience learning about and seeing Wyeth's work and his inspiration.Very well curated collection and on side tours of the family house and studio plus Kuerner Farm.,2
4,"Let me start off by saying the BBQ shrimp at Mr. B's was the single best plate of food I had while in New Orleans. Spent almost five days there, and didn't enjoy any dish more. Staff was really friendly and we enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant. Felt like we were in a throwback New York joint. The only reason I'm not giving them 5-stars is because the crab cake, although mostly crab, was not very flavorful and overpriced for just being a single serving. So, if you want BBQ shrimp, I'd recommend this place 11 times out of 10.",2
5,Eclipse Pizza has been our favorite pizza place for years. Try the Ironman Pizza and the carrot cake!,2
4,"I went to El Camino Real for a surprise birthday party for my cousin-in-law. A few of us went early to eat dinner before the guest of honor arrived. I was feeling kind of sick that day, so I opted for a chicken taco salad (which I judged to be a mild and non-offensive menu choice). I was shocked at how delicious a taco salad could be. I could have drank the cumin vingarette out of a glass. I was also instantly jealous, and began feeling better, when I saw what some of the other folks I was with ordered to eat. One person got the brisket and another got the pulled pork sandwich, and the aromas that were entering my nose were soothing and enticing. Bottom line: I'd like to go back and be more adventurous with my meal choice.",2
2,"I went here with a friend who had a Groupon.  The sushi was horrible, full of filler breadcrums and very skimpy on fish.  They took a lot of time and care to decorate the plate with fresh orchids and I wish that they would have invested this extra money into giving us more fish in our rolls.",0
3,"I came here for my birthday as mentioned by Aria S. I made reservations for a Wed night for a group of 9 (this is their max). Good thing too, because every table was full. Since this is a BYOB, we had about 7 bottles of wine for the table. As I looked around, every other table had ice for their wine. I had to ask our waiter after about 15 minutes if he could bring us a couple ice buckets for the table. He took our wine and put it over on a window sill. This was a little strange, but it only got worse. We didn't know if it was appropriate to grab it ourselves or if he would pour it for us. We spent the entire evening walking through the restaurant to awkwardly pour wine. Not exactly how I wanted to spend my bday dinner. Its especially frustrating because this is a BYOB restaurant, you'd think this wouldnt have been an issue. Besides this, the service was fine. They also accommodate to the gluten free people out there.Onto the food. We started with dips of the day, very authentic and tasty. I ordered the braised rabbit leg. I thought the meat itself was fine. I wish it was seasoned better and more tender, especially for $26. Luckily I was able to try a few of my friends' dishes. My favorite was the stuffed pepper. I really wish I ordered that instead. Unfortunately I will not be coming back here. I wish I was able to have a great experience like some of the people below.",1
5,"Passed by Tzin many times without realizing it's there, finally went to try this tiny but awesome wine and tapas bar. Tasted 4 tapas dish and each single one is delicious and portioned just right. Highly recommend letting the owner picking the wine pairing, I don't know how he does it, but he seems to know what wine I would like better than myself. Definitely made into my top 5 restaurants in E-town, make sure you make a reservation, they only have less than 1o tables,",2
5,"This was the BEST BLT Wrap that I have ever had, the bacon was "" perfectly prepared""  thick and crisp, but not burnt.",2
2,"A typical South Jersey BYOB Italian restaurant located in a strip center with a brick oven, go figure! The restaurant is mediocre at best. Service was good, fast, food came out quickly since table turnover is a priority. So fast they forgot the sundried tomatoes in the Chicken Abruzzi dish we ordered. My friend ordered spaghettiand meatballs, and the server brought out ziti and meatballs, Really? So can understand the confusion between ziti and spaghetti since this is an Italian restaurant! I could honestly overlook all of these oversights if it wasn't for the fact that they actually charge $2.00 if you would like salad w/dinner! I failed to mention, it's a half portion! I guess it's understandable, the rent must be expensive in an empty strip center shared w/ Burger King.",0
2,"Snooty, noisy and expensive. Food is ok and location is good but the staff are snobs ( hard to fathom why ) and the acoustics make for uncomfortable l veld of noise.Not with it.",0
4,Their prices are standard for salons in the Manayunk area.  It is usually pretty easy to get an appointment.  I never really had a bad haircut although I never do anything crazy with my hair either.  The space is very open and clean with friendly staff everywhere.  My only gripe is that there seems to be a high turnover with their stylists.  I only had the same stylist twice.  They do send a discount in the mail to apologize for the inconvenience.,2
2,Came in looking for housewares and furniture.  Didn't find anything worth buying.,0
4,"Held a baby shower here recently for my daughter .  Marissa was very helpful in the planning and I think everyone enjoyed themselves.  We used the main dining room and bar area.  The brunch food we chose was plentiful and mostly yummy although the grits were a bit bland .  We had sampled the shrimp and grits which were very good when scouting the place but the cheesy grits I had on that dateDid not compare - however the rest of the food - including sausage , bacon , eggs and pancakes was yummy .  I wish their pastries included some kind of iced cinnamon roll mostly because that's a favorite of mine but also because it would have been more festive than the small muffins which were aBit dry - the glazed donut/ roll was good though .  The only real issue was that the drink station - serve themselves coffee and hot water in thermal vessels and juices plus champagne to make mimosas - was not out until about 30 minutes after guests arrived -- and the juice carafes were very small - almost like what you'd place on one table so kept needing refill ( I think when it appears like there is only a small amount guests will be influenced to not tAke much out of politeness so should look plentiful ) also twice when I went for coffee it was empty -- although they did refill it when asked .  The staff was very pleasant - the bartender was helpful and good about our taking up his entire bar top .  I'd highly recommend this as a party venue or just as a good brunch place",2
4,"I dig Three Muses, because it's close to the touristy French Quarter, but is so totally, refreshingly Marigny.  It, like the Uptown Delachaise, which I also visited on my most recent trip to the Crescent City, is a gastropub/winebar with small plates and a decent selection of wine and draft beers.Be advised that the plates are indeed quite small.  If you're starving, I'd say you could easily put away three of them yourself.  My friend and I had two each, plus dessert, and weren't super full when we left.  Seating is also limited and the seats by the door were absolutely freezing!  It was a warm evening in late November, but the doors were open and cold air was blowing on us.  Eventually we moved to the bar when two seats opened up there.You order at the bar, which seems to somehow work better here than it did at Delachaise.  The food runner was sweet as pie!  There is an impressive vegetarian portion of the menu, of which we sampled the feta fries, falafel bites, housemade rigatoni, and miticana gratin, all of which were totally yum.  For dessert: chocolate heaven and banana-marscapon struedel.  I'm drooling over the memory of eating it.The band playing was just freaking excellent.  I had a 9:00 Fringe Fest show to be at, so we missed most of their show, but what we saw / heard was super.I'd definitely visit again, next trip down south.",2
5,"From the moment we walked in I knew we had found the right place for like lunch. Filled with locals and tourists alike, the atmosphere was warm and inviting:) Our bartender welcomed us to the bar counter and introduced himself as Phil and made us feel right at home. My turkey Brie sandwich was off the hook and the tequila was even better!! This wouldn't have been the awesome experience it was with our awesome bartender Phil!!",2
5,"Me and my boyfriend stopped here traveling through Riverway and it was the best decision we made all weekend. We had the fried tofu as an appetizer and we both had the chicken pad Thai. The food was fresh, made from scratch and so tasty. It wasn't greasy at all and didn't give that full bloated feeling afterwards. The service was impeccable and the prices were great for the portions. There is also a separate vegan menu! We will be returning!",2
1,"Never been a big fan of this place. Food is very mediocre, nothing special by any stretch but our last experience with Cafe Roma was just ridiculous. We ordered online..waited an hour and then called to politely check on our order and got attitude by the person answering saying it typically takes 45 mins but its only been 59 mins. not an hour. Ok. So another 15 mins passes when my genius bf notices that he mis-typed his phone number so he calls to correct his mistake and was told that the food would not be coming. Period. We were shocked. Even without the phone number, they had our full address and we were not very far from the restaurant. They did not attempt to deliver, and had no intention of doing so. No excuse for such unprofessional service. Shame, shame, shame.",0
2,"The grits and mac and cheese were incredible. Hot chicken sandwich was pretty bad. The chicken was so over cooked and parts of it were inedible. Won't be back, there's better BBQ elsewhere.",0
2,"I recently withdrew my kids from this school for the following reasons:1. I enrolled them here prior to moving into a new house so I was driving 1 hour 15 min every day twice roundtrip to pickup and drop off. Not the school's fault so this doesn't count against them in my star rating, but does take a toll when other areas of the school aren't performing.  2. The food - This food is regular school cafeteria food. I mostly feed my kids healthy meals. The food here is canned, boxed, etc, and the portions they give the children are so small!  My kids are hungry when I pick them up. 3. Administration - We were originally on a waitlist at the kids' new school until the summer, but I got a call they were able to get them in sooner. Primrose has a 2 week notice to withdraw kids from this location, but between all the sick days and then a waitlist for several classrooms there we though it wouldn't be a challenge to work something out so we didn't have to pay for 2 schools. We asked to speak with the owners, and we were only able to get as far as talking to administration. We withdrew them a week ago.  They charged us almost $1,000 for two children that won't even be there.  We asked to find a compromise but someone called from administration and told us there was nothing they would do and we needed to follow through with the contract we signed about the cancellation policy. 4. They will not move a child to a new classroom until they hit a certain age regardless of how excelled they are. I had the teachers tell me several times my daughter should be in the next classroom up. I know this is not an uncommon thing in the schools, but it is frustrating.  5. The Germs!  I know kids get sick when they first start school, but the kids are sick all the time. They do not seem to have a strict sick policy. There are always kids in both of my kids' classes that are coughing, sneezing, or have green boogers constantly hanging from their noses. They also had HFM, strep, and several other serious illnesses widespread throughout the school. I gave an extra star for the few teachers there that are just wonderful and will be missed!  Seriously, there are a few girls there that are complete rockstars and just love the kids so much!",0
2,"We used to go here quite a bit, but haven't been in a few months.  The food and service was always great in the past.  Today the service was completely horrible.  The margarita was the worst I've ever had.  The whole bottom of the glass was covered in salt.  It wasn't drinkable and the server didn't offer to make me another one or to take it off the bill.  The server had a really hard time taking our order.  He was probably new because he didn't know the menu.  He dropped off our food, but left the table so fast that we couldn't even ask for sauce for our tacos.  He didn't come back to check on us until after we were finished eating.  The food was okay, but very bland without sauce.  Very disappointing.",0
4,Stopped in again for a second visit. We got there at 8:15 on Saturday and had to wait about 15 minutes for a table of 5. After we arrived the line grew rapidly. By the time we ordered it was around the corner of the building and down the sidewalk. The service and food were good. My husband loves the Breakfast Medley with the perfectly good hash browns and over easy eggs. I also recommend the Chocolate Sin and Sweet Potato Pancakes. Next time I'm going to try the French Toast. It looked delicious.,2
5,"I was on a trip to Philadelphia when I had my very first Cannolis there and OMG I wasn't disappointed! Fresh, sweet, and addictive are the best three words to describe my Cannolis experience! The filling comes in three different flavours, chocolate, vanilla, and ricotta with chocolate chips. I tried the ricotta and chocolate chips one and I can't even describe how heavenly it was. On the other hand, I tried their Éclaires, naah not that good and I definitely had better ones in several other places. But hey, it's an Italian shop, didn't expect them to make great French pastry anyways.I live in VA but I'd drive all the way back to Philly for those cannolis. Bottom line, this place gets 5 stars from me because of the cannollis.",2
5,SRS is truly an exceptional management company. They have been extremely accommodating with very specific requests that I have made. Recommend.,2
3,"The food  here was consistent with what I have tried at other OSFs in WA and CA. Good and reasonably priced. The environment is nice as well. However, the service at the downtown Nashville location was less than a professional three-course restaurant service. Main course was brought to our table less than 5 min after the soup/salad starter. I hadn't even had half of my soup yet when the spaghetti was put next to it. So it had to sit on the table while I finished soup.Similar thing with dessert (ice cream). It came without asking us if we were done with food, which we weren't. It felt like the server just wanted to get done with his routine. Food gets 4 and service gets 2 stars.",1
3,"To sum it up, it's an average bar with ties to a very well-known TV show - but that fact doesn't make the food or much else better. When I went they had $4 White Rascal's and on top of that I had the normal gravy fries. $11 for fries, steep to say the least. They were steak fries, covered in gravy and mozzarella cheese and while pretty damn good, I would be hesitant to say that they're worth the price. Service was good, sometimes a little slow, but still friendly.",1
4,"Cool mom & pop Greek spot. Great breskfasts, greek salads, friendly, oersonsl service. Ssk for Jufy",2
4,The pizza was awesome-crisp crust and great taste. The Cesar salad was a little weak but the dressing was still good.,2
4,"I was talked into going to Sockeye on Fairview (despite not being terribly fond of the original) and I'm glad I took the advice. Our server Alyssa (sp?) was attentive but not overly so. I asked her for advice on the menu. She suggested several items, but the Chicken Comfort Bowl with bacon and jalapeños really stood out. It was very, very good!The didn't have my beloved Heineken, but I tried their Galena Gold. It was good, but not great. I'll be back and I definitely recommend it for good food and great service. If you love their beer you will really like this place.",2
5,"Love this place. Come in sit in the back,  relax and have some me time.  They have all types of spiritual  items for sale. Really nice gifts too.",2
5,"""The best Eggs Benedict I can remember ever eating.""OK, it was a lovely morning in Boise,  sunshiny and people enjoying the patio and the spacious bright inside restaurant.  The staff was very attentive and pleasant... like they were actually glad we were there.  From my view... this was a wonderful breakfast experience.",2
3,Had a great view but too many plants in the Windows. Large seating dining broke up into sections around a large bar area. Very nice atmosphere. Friendly staff. Large menu. My hubby ordered the Ribeye and fries. They seasoned and cooked it perfectly. I ordered the chicken carbonara. Unfortunately it's without the egg but was very good anyway. They don't serve bread nor salad with the pasta dishes. The steak came with salad. Their gooey cake is a must.,1
5,"This tour was awesome! My friend scheduled this tour in advance for my group of 5 our first night staying in the French quarter. Out of all the things I was told to do in NOLA, going on a haunted tour was the top of our list! We met the tour guide on the corner of a busy area outside a small grocery store. The only thing I might say that was confusing was the other groups that were doing a haunted tour the same time we were and were meeting in the same vicinity. We approached the other group by accident and said we were there for the 5 in 1 tour, the man who for the other tour company told us we were in the wrong place and made very negative comments about our tour guide and the company we had signed up for. Honestly it just made HIS company look bad that he would say that to someone. Anywho, the tour was awesome-not going to give any of it away because the stories are best told by the Bone Lady herself. She was so animated and knowledgeable and while other reviewers have said negative comments about the tour, they probably just weren't paying attention (which is hard to do on a Friday night in the French quarter) At the very end of the tour our group approached the bone lady to tell her how much we enjoyed the tour, she told us about her cemetery tour which was taking place on Sunday. We signed up with her right then and there! SERIOUSLY go on both of these tours, you won't regret it! One more comment about the negative reviews, you'll notice a couple people say it's boring: it's not! It's a 5 in 1 tour that lasts 2 hours, there's a TON of history to go over and if you're chatting or not paying attention you will miss all of the stories!",2
5,"A quaint & warm atmosphere, friendly servers and awesome food.  Echoing the previous reviews - do yourself a favor and try the grits. I would def recommend this cafe to anyone.",2
1,"Let's be honest. One of the tragedies of the human condition is imagination.  We have the capacity to dream and fantasize limitless dreams and fantasies. We conjure our imagined selves to be these powerful beings without hindrance or handicap and when we are optimists and ambitious people we pursue these dreams with fervent dedication.However, unfortunately because we are limited by imperfection we are unable to satisfy every desire dreamed. The Saltwater Grill undoubtedly was born out of this beautiful dream - day dreams of contending with the big boy Louisiana seafood restaurants and being THE PLACE for Riverebend folks to go when it's time for that fried seafood platter. But it will never be this if trends continue (over priced mediocre food, a basic misunderstanding of flavor, weird service, uncomfortable ambiance - read all the other bad reviews for details). When you are growing your business, your good reviews only matter a fraction of what your bad reviews are worth. Take the note, Saltwater Grill!  Read your bad reviews and make intelligent changes!  It seems like every complaint from the bad reviews were duplicated in our experience. That seems real lazy.Sometimes we must take hard, honest looks at ourselves and admit that we can't do ALL THE THINGS well.  It appears as if running a restaurant is just not something the folks at Saltwater can do well.Look- I can't skateboard. I can keep thinking I can for the rest of my life but the longer I keep this dream alive the more likely I am to break my leg trying to do something stupid. Know what I mean?",0
5,"Went to dinner here with friends, and can't help but question the folks who said they had terrible service or so so food. we had an exceptional waiter, who truly knew the food, the wine, and wasn't afraid to make recommendations. loved him, very professional. The ambiance was excellent too. I do enjoy the bright lights, modern feel of some of Tucson's newer restaurants, but this was a nice break from that. For dinner at least, it was low lighting, elegant, real Tucson feel. The place was hopping, there was light jazz played live, the drinks were amazing...the food OUTSTANDING. my friends can be somewhat hard to please...and Maynard's wowed them. I'm going back today for lunch with coworkers, and hope it's as good...without the dinner menu. Have heard great things about the Cuban style pulled pork sandwich.ok...UPDATE: Cuban pork sandwich is amazing! slow roasted, melt in your mouth pork on a delicious ciabatta bread, with spicy mayonnaise, fresh cilantro, roasted jalapenos...can't go wrong! very nice to sit on the patio in the afternoon, too!",2
5,"Three letters, WOW!  Food was excellent and relatively cheap for the FQ.  Our waitress Kerry was excellent.  I had the big easy breakfast which came with lots of food that I could not finish.

2,"The room is adequate.  However the parking structure was completely full and there was no additional parking.  We called on the evening of arrival to ask for them to bring blankets for the fold out bed., and towels.  The NEVER came.  When we weregoing out for the day. we called the front desk to ask that our room be tidied up, but when we returned the room had not been touched.  We also let the housekeeper in hallway know we were leaving the room for a while if she could pleasemake up the beds.  There was 1 bath towel in the room.  When I called for towels. was told they will be coming out of the dryer soon.   I would NOT recommend this hotel as there are several in the area and I'm quite sure you will receive better service at another hotel.",0
5,"If you're in the Indianapolis area and in need of Gucci come see Shonda she is amazing. My ring was ordered on Monday it's here today, talk about service.",2
4,"Decided to try this place since it's close to my house...it was a good gamble.  Fish was fresh and the chefs were really attentive to us.  We were in there before a dinner ""rush"" so I can't speak to what it would be like if it was super busy, but we were pleased and would definitely go back.",2
5,Melissa is by far the BEST! I've gone to two other lash lounges and I will tell you Melissa outdoes them all. She knows her craft. She doesn't double or triple stack lashes. She gets you in and out. 100% recommend going to Melissa.,2
4,"I heard alot about Honey's and how the food is so good here. I chose today my birthday to be my first visit .I read earlier reviews about how crowded it gets and they were not lying but I didn't wait no more than 20 minutes. Now let's get down to the food it was delicious. I had french toast, home fries, sausage and for dessert a slice of Jewish apple cake and it was to die for! I will be back most definitely.",2
3,"I went to Han Dynasty earlier this week and ordered some noodles and a fish dish. We'd never been there before and when the fish dish came, we took a few bites before realizing it was pieces of pork belly. It was hard to tell at first due to the heavy colored sauce/ vegetables. When we told the server that neither of us ate pork for religious reasons, the server replaced the dish. However, by then we had lost our appetite. When it came time to pay the bill, I was surprised that there was no discount for the mistake they had made. I like the food overall, but the customer service is far from ideal.",1
2,"Service is ok, cooler and dining on your beignets inside isnt the same but on a hot and humid night you can appreciate the blasting A/C in Morning Call.Cash, parking lot, little wait time.Prices have gone up but who is gonna complain when it's still pretty cheap. Beignets here are lighter and come plain so that you can toss your own confectioner sugar on it.Overall if you want the tourist experience head down the French Quarter's, and put your elbows on the sticky tables down there.",0
5,Ice cream martinis. What more could one want one a Friday night? Their food is good as well. Portions are filling and taste good. The ambience of the place is what really sold it for me. It's a great hangout.,2
5,"The Food here is bomb.com on Wednesday they have 1.00 jumbo wings and they are really good and seasoned just right. The drink i fell in love with is the Dirty Lemonade, If you're in Indianapolis come visit this place.",2
2,"I usually have nothing but good to say about the Peppermill, but this weekend we wanted to extend our stay and was denied a room! The front desk said there was no rooms but when I went on the website there were a lot of rooms to reserve.i guess because we get promos and stay at discount prices during the week they didn't want us here! They even lied about it! So SILVERLEGACY HERE WE COME! Disappointed!",0
5,HandleBar is a great!! A great two hours and would recommend any night of the week! Arrive early & grab one of the seats without pedals or up front that take all the work! The stops were spot on! The drivers adds to the great time too.,2
2,"Smells like something burnt in here. Full Montegu sandwich was good, but I am used to bigger sandwich at this price.  Nothing to really impress me here.  I won't want to come back any time soon voluntarily. However, I've been told the Thanksgiving sandwich is memorable.",0
5,"We've been there for Valentine's Day !! It was actually really good, well priced and really nice service !! They Cook in front of us as well ! Awesome experience",2
5,"Overall FIVE stars!! The customer service was excellent and the food was one of a kind!  For starters we shared the seafood gumbo.  It was very tasty and full of flavor.  I had the portabello mushroom dish that was not too heavy and perfect for me.  My fiancé had the Mr. Bs BBQ shrimp!  This was our favorite!! Drank the sauce with a spoon afterwards.  For dessert we had homemade green apple sorbet!! It was a perfect way to end our night!  We wanted to eat here again, but the whole meal PLUS our drinks was $175!!",2
4,This place is very crowded.  The prices are reasonable.  We had two omelets and two coffees.  The food was good but not great.  The eggs were overcooked and the cheese very light so nothing to cover up the overcooked eggs.  Coffee was fine for an all you drink setup.    Four stars because the service was quick and friendly.,2
5,"This was my second time dining at The Prime Rib, and as before, everything was perfect. It has now been cemented as my go-to place for an occasion dinner. We arrived early, and sat at the bar just in time for the happy hour special. The bartender was a bit slow to take our order, but it was unexpectedly crowded for a Tuesday night, so that was excusable. We brought our own bottle of wine (which you can do, albeit at the expense of a $25 corking fee, though they do not advertise this), which we left with the hostess when we came in. When it came time for our reservation, our bottle of wine was already waiting at our table, on a small silver tray. I was quite impressed.The Prime Rib exudes elegance in a way few places do nowadays. From the leopard print carpet to the black wood paneling to the lucite-lidded grand piano to the sharply suited waiters, you feel like you stepped back in time to an elegant restaurant in Midtown Manhattan in all the best ways. Our waiter, as expected, was impeccable. Even though he was also waiting on a large group nearby, our wine glasses were always full and our food was brought out with perfect timing.As an appetizer, my boyfriend and I ordered the tuna tartare to split. When it came out, it was already split onto individual plates, which was a nice touch. The tuna was delicious, and there was certainly $19 worth of it between our two plates. For entrees, I ordered the veal porterhouse, and my boyfriend ordered the full cut of the prime rib. I am a tremendous fan of veal, though I had never had it as a porterhouse steak before, and I was not disappointed. Deliciously seasoned, generously cut, and perfectly tender, I would order it again in a heartbeat. The full cut of the prime rib was, to quote my boyfriend, ""as big as [his] head"". I didn't even know one could have a cut of meat so gigantic. He said it was delicious, and after trying a bit, I agreed with him. He didn't finish it, and I imagine most people wouldn't be able to. We got potatoes au gratin on the side, and they were good, but they're just potatoes au gratin, nothing to write home about. For dessert, I got a slice of key lime pie, which was solidly good, as expected.Was it expensive? Sure it was. Was it overpriced? I would say no. The quality of the food, the service, and the atmosphere to me was well worth the price. We will certainly be back.",2
5,"My hubbie likes to think of himself as a pizza connoisseur they serve pizza, he's probably eaten there. We go to Mellow Mushroom about 3x/month and this place has the best pizza in the bay...hands down!We enjoy the Maui Wowie...pesto, chicken, bacon, pineapple, and banana peppers. The crust is always cooked to the perfect crunchy texture and there's a great beer selection here. Staff is always very friendly and have never had to wait for a table.",2
4,"This place deserves a good mention.  It's one of my favorite spots for my lunch break.  Pretty solid Thai food that isn't the best I ever had but is consistently good, with hearty portions that can satisfy any Thai craving. Add affordable prices and you have a winning combo.I am so often struck by how great the service at Singha is. It's fast and efficient, and friendly to boot.  Other restaurants downtown need to take notice.  Singha is consistently packed, and turning over the tables, because it isn't glacier-slow at lunch time.  Sure, there seem to be quite a few servers on payroll, but those ladies (mostly ladies) hustle, and the place is probably doing more than enough revenue to cover the costs.  Singha also deserves praise for offering something not readily available downtown. I wish this place a long and prosperous future.  Whoever owns and/or manages this place is doing something right.",2
5,"I am from WA state and was in town visiting my sister the week of Thanksgiving. She scheduled us hair appointments with Ally W.  I was very nervous because I hadn't colored my hair in 7 years(it was just a very boring brown color) ;) I have hard water and didn't want my water to change the colors. I explained to her kind of what I wanted (blonde highlights) then told her about my hard water. She said she had a plan for me and would love to do caramel since my water is so hard. I let her do what she thought was best (usually I wouldn't), but she seemed to know what she was talking about and was VERY VERY confident in her job. I trusted her and walked out of the salon feeling fabulous. She did such an amazing job and I have never gotten so many compliments on my hair.  I love the confidence that she had and she was so personable. If I lived closer I would go back in a heartbeat. The next time I come and visit I will definitely be making another appointment with her. Thank you again Ally. Carrie",2
5,"We got there past 5pm on a Saturday night and the wait list is not long. Maybe like 4 people ahead of us on the list you get to choose to be seated inside or out. We chose both. 20 mins later, we noticed the list filled up fast! The wait is longer if you want to be seated outside. The food is GREAT! Only one unisex restroom available inside.",2
4,"I went opening night. It seemed like a few small things needed to be hammered out but over all the food, drinks, and over all atmosphere was spot on. A little more salt here... A little more pepper there... I can't wait to go back and see how the restaurant evolves.",2
4,"Man.... The chicken here was so freaking hot and fresh!!!!!!!!!!! THEM BISCUITS THO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The red beans and rice.... Man. Flavor, flavor everywhere! I went here at 10 a.m. before we left for our cruise; everything was HOT AND FRESH. I was a bit annoyed because people who came in after me got their food before me, but when I got my food, man.... it made up for the wait. The signature sauces they provided were not all that, the young lady who work there even said she didn't like them, so I stuck with some regular ol ranch for my tenders. Definitely a must have when you're in the N.O. On Canal Street. I ate my food so fast I couldn't even take a pic. And yall know that ain't like me to not take a pic of my food!!!!!!!!",2
5,"I have been here twice now and both times have been fabulous. The first time I went was in early July with my mother.  We both had a great time and our paintings turned out great.  It was a great night with my mom.  The second time I went, my husband and I went to the Paint Your Pet event in support of the Nevada Humane Society.  We sent in pictures of our dogs a few weeks before the class and they had sketched out our pet on the canvas.  It was such a fund night and because everyone was painting something different - it was fun to walk around and look.  We will be back and I will continue to take friends and family there.",2
4,"I've finally eaten here enough times that I feel comfortable to give a review.I will start with the crab legs- on the smaller side, but they are okay. Usually juicy and easy to crack.Calamari- some of the best calamari I've ever had, the sweet chili sauce on top is so delicious.Salmon meal- I was hesitant about this but surprisingly the salmon was pretty good. The potatoes were not so great but edible nonetheless.Drinks- $4 glasses of wine, need I say more? Overall, I am an extremely picky eater and this place borders on a 3 star (food wise) but you cannot beat $4 glasses of wine, tons of seating, and huge flat screens.",2
1,"Visited tonight for take-out.  16 bucks for the tutto du Mari, which had 6 small shrimp and a bunch of nasty canned clams, most of which were so mushed up I couldn't tell what they were.  No seasoning except salt and tons of pepper.  Sauce tasted like flour and water.  Salad was limp and soggy.  Bread was ok, but basically a giant unheated roll.  16 bucks for one bite of salad that I spat out, six small shrimp, a bite of bread, and 2 forkfuls of pasta.  The rest went into the trash.  If I hadn't gotten take-out, entire meal would have gone back.Gooey butter cake was ok but not particularly fresh, and t-ravs were edible (but easy to get frozen so hard to mess up).  Hubby had the chicken portobello pasta and reported it bland but inoffensive.",0

5,"I had numerous things happen during my move and required additional services from this office. The guys in this office are top notch and are very trustworthy. I'd say more about how they took great care of me, but they may have gone above and beyond what they should have and afraid to say too much. I would recommend this office to my mother!",2
4,The original plain fro yo! Has the right amount of tang and zip. No topping needed. Obsessed.,2
4,"Had a nice, quiet dinner here last Wednesday and would certainly recommend. Our reservation was not necessary as only a few other patrons cycled through the restaurant throughout the evening, but since it's a fairly small space, it's probably not a bad idea to make a reservation just in case (and especially on a weekend). The service was friendly and unobtrusive, and the interior of the restaurant feels homey and intimate. Upon arrival, we were immediately greeted, seated, and provided an ice bucket for our BYO bottle of white. We lingered a while after dinner to finish the wine and did not feel unwelcome or rushed at all. And dinner itself was very good; my green curry was just the right amount of spicy, and the portions were small enough to finish but large enough to be filling. Great place for a casual evening on a quiet block near Rittenhouse!",2
4,"We were in NOLA for a week, staying close to Horns, which made it a perfect breakfast place for us.  The service was wonderful and the staff was very personable!  On only our second visit, Pamela immediately brought the same drink order we had at our previous visit.  Horns really has a home-town feel to it.The menu is interesting. Maybe not a lot of choices for me, but I'm not from around here.  We just stuck to more basic items.I recommend!",2
3,"My problem isn't with the Chesterbrook Trader Joe's per se, it is with their ""home office"". They drop items faster than you would drop a hot knife. Over the years, I've loved their Curried Tuna, in pouches, about a buck sixty-nine, in red, yellow and green curries. Add some rice, a splash of coconut milk and fresh cilantro leaves and you have a marvelous casserole. I bought it, the rice and the coconut milk by the bagfuls. How did Trader Joe's reward my fidelity? THEY DISCONTINUED IT...saying it wasn't ""cost-effective"" to the consumer. WHA??Over the years, I bought their Greek-style spinach pie with feta cheese. It was a very popular item. Then, one day, they replaced that item with a Trader Joe's pie...spinach and kale with feta. That new pie tasted like grass that had just been cut by a mower. Yuuuck. Their explanation? They wanted a Trader Joe's product so they discontinued the one that was better but wasn't made by Trader Joe's.The list goes, sadly, on and on. Buy a product at Trader Joe's, like the product, buy even more of the product and, yet...""home office"" drops that item for no apparent reason...time after time after time.I have to admit: I go to Traders a lot less these days because you can never depend on a product you've supported and bought in abundance actually being there. The people at the customer service desk see me coming and hide because they have run out of explanations as to why seemingly popular items are dropped.So, Trader Joe's...you're running customers off because of the abrupt changes with the availability of products in your stores. C ya...",1
4,"Great place for families, and food is fantastic! The recipes are creative and original. We've been there several times and always have a great experience!",2
2,"Over-promises, and under-delivers. Quoted 12pm delivery and not only was 30 min late but also forgot to bring the soda we ordered. Said it would take 5 minutes to bring the soda and doesn't come back for another 30 minutes. Pizza was lukewarm and no soda. Thanks.",0
4,"I stopped by with my partner during happy hour and it was busy, but didn't seem to attract a rowdy crowd. There was a great mix of people of different ages and it felt very accessible. This is the first place I ever felt offered an impressive selection of beers both on tap and canned/bottled. I also overheard the staff patiently help some patrons decide what to drink based on their preferences--some places get very impatient and just want you to pick something. That being said, servers were either very attentive or very busy, but that's to be expected. This is my new favorite spot in the Funk Zone!",2
5,"I'm picky when it comes to pizza, and Brixx is a win every time! I love that their menu incorporates gluten-free options and perfectly sized lunch options. The wrap around bar also makes it the perfect stop to unwind after work, but arrive early, their patio fills up quickly!",2
4,"My girlfriend and I just went there Saturday night and loved it. The food is fresh and very good - plus reasonably priced. They had already run out of the Crab Legs we wanted, so we went with another crab dish that was also good. The lobster bisque was very good and the shrimp tacos were really great. I wish the chairs had backs on them though - we sat indoors and most of the seats are bar stools - so kind of uncomfortable.",2
5,"Good stay, comfortable beds, modern decor, everything I was looking for.  It's across the street from a few fast food joints and has a big park lots.",2
4,"My temporary apartment in Boise does not have a washer or dryer, so turned to Yelp to find one with good service and reasonable prices. A few popped up in the search and I decided to try my luck at Scrubby's. It has a fun name, after all.My first visit was on a Wednesday night after work. Parking lot was small but there were a few spaces available. When I first entered there were several people milling about, though none approached me so I wasn't sure if any were employees. The layout was as such: dryers lined the back and left side walls, rows of washers took up the center. Folding tables were scattered between the washers and laundry carts were interspersed throughout. The walls (both interior and exterior) were decorated in whimsical paintings and neon lights in shapes of bubbles and clotheslines, which was a cute touch.I walked to the second row and tried to find an open washer. There were plenty, but what I quickly realized was that nearly all of the $1.25 washers were ""out of order,"" while the $1.75 were all working. Convenient. I loaded up two machines. They were good sizes and easily fit all of my items. Washes took just under 30 mins, so ran over to Albertson's across the street to grab a sandwich for dinner. Once I was back, I loaded my stuff in two dryers. Cost is $0.25/7 minutes for regular size, $0.25/4 minutes for XL dryers. You have options of high, permanent press, and low heat. The regulars worked well; one dryer needed 3 cycles, the other 4. I used permanent press.Overall a decent laundromat. They have wifi which was a nice way to kill some time waiting. It was relatively clean and odor free, though the constant barrage of flies can be really annoying. And while I wasn't approached by anyone, a girl did eventually make her way to another customer who needed help. Note: they have coin machines to make change but no ATM. Go to Albertson's for that, or come prepared with cash. Scrubby's also has a drop-and-go service that might be worth pursuing if that's your thing. And they have a loyalty card that gives you $1.50 in cash after 6 visits. Be sure to ask for one. I would use this place again, and in fact did so on a Friday afternoon with a similar experience, though with the addition of Maury paternity tests on TV. On that visit I noticed they had repaired a few of the $1.25 machines, which is the reason I bumped my original 3 star review to 4. Maybe it wasn't a scam after all.",2
4,Was very excited to have this restaurant open a location in Goleta. My family enjoys take out from here on occasion. The food is always excellent and the staff is very friendly.,2
4,"Just had a pepperoni slice and it was really good. There isn't much to eat in the Reno airport, especially after you pass through security. The people were pleasant and a beer and a slice for $10 is a pretty good deal.",2
4,Great grocery for for everyday items! Usually no wait for check out! Fast counter should be more ready for items out of stock or need more prep time. I have waited more than most would for items that need to be made due to being sold out.Clean & friendly staff! Left Publix for this 1 location on grocery store. Now has a Tesla charging station.,2
5,"Amazing beer and all for an amazing price! They have a great food truck outside , wonderful seating place under the trees. The BrewTenders are great! The severe told a funny story about the dickin cider customer. This bar reminds of us of our home brewery out of CO and NM. Awesome place. Come and enjoy!",2
2,Had the Spring onion soup. Could not eat it. Much too salty. Much too spicy hot and I like hot. The General Tso's wings were ok but too much sauce- drenched in sauce. My husband had the pulled mushroom sandwich. Funny taste. Guess we will not be back.  Noise level very very loud too. Sorry to have to write this because we like to patronize local places. They are very busy so I guess we are of a minority opinion,0
5,"I MUST say, this was a really great experience and I will definitely do this again!! The bread pudding was excellent!!.. I love that it was a hands. We started off making the bread pudding to put in the oven, then we moved onto chopping all ingredients for the gumbo and étouffée. Once everything was chopped, we were taught how to make roux and started making our gumbo and crawfish étouffée . After everything was done, we plated our food and all sat down together and enjoyed our wonderfully cooked meal with some wine!!",2
5,"Had a great experience. Place is really clean and has cool decor. Service was prompt and intuitive. The food was delicious. Make sure to leave room for dessert, the dessert menu is a picture book from their bakery. Prices were great as well!",2
4,We had so much fun on Friday night that we came back on Saturday. The bartenders here are super nice and even recognized us. The music was great on Friday with lots of hip hop. It's a spacey venue and has outdoor area so plenty of space to hang out without feeling like a packed can of sardines. Fun place overall.,2
2,"Being a vegetarian while visiting New Orleans is no easy feat.  However, when I have found eats, they are usually very good.  Tomasito's was below the standard I have gotten used to.  Not to say it was bad, not at all.  I had the chips and a bean and cheese burrito. I would have gotten rice in my burrito but it was not vegetarian (really?).  Service was ok, and the flan was excellent (although ""with berries"" seems to mean one raspberry).That being said, at least there was food to eat on the menu, and that is not assumes in New Orleans.",0
3,"My revisit update offers the same rating, for different reasons.  This is still a pretty expensive burger place...maybe get rid of one of the guys and lower the price 20%. ;) The burgers are real good and the toppings make it super delicious.On this visit my bacon cheeseburger was somewhat baconless...it had three small chips of bacon, like it was the last pieces left.Apparently visiting after dinner is a no-no.",1
1,Employees never have grille items!!!! Always slacking at the easiest job ever!!!! How hard is it!???even worse now!!! Absolutely no food on grille at 11:00.....bugs everywhere !!! Wow needed a drink ! And they literally stole 02$!!!And still no grille food!!!! N,0
4,Food and atmosphere is nice. As one should expect in the CBD. Sometimes the back room can be stuffy on a busy day. I recommend the raw oysters and burgers. A few dollars on the high side for lunch.,2
4,"I went to Ted Drewes last night and was reminded that I never reviewed it. Ted Drewes is a St. Louis staple and a must have after the Cardinals game. Some of my faves are the Strawberry Shortcake, Lemon Crumb, or Smores concrete. All equally delicious. I usually have one of my dogs in tow, so it is much appreciated that they sell doggy bowls with small amounts of Custard for only $1.50. My only (small) gripe about Ted Drewes is the parking situation. Ted Drewes is right near a very busy road and the parking lot is always super packed, so parents should make sure to keep kids close by! There are a couple of benches there, but most people with vans or jeeps pop their trunk and eat in the back of their car. Over all, I give Ted Drewes an A+!",2
5,"Always good! Very fair price (almost too good) for the amount of meat they give you. I took my mom here when she came to town, because I took her to all of my favorite spots in town. Hope this place stays the same!",2
5,Excellent little family owned restaurant where each member of their team is passionate about their food! Loved the food too! Definitely be back for more to try!,2
2,Not the experience we had hoped for. We were on a family vacation from Arkansas as this is one of the closest locations to us. The menu was confusing as they have fresh fish on the menu but if it does not have a checkmark beside it they do not currently have it. I wanted halibut but there was no checkmark. So I asked the waitress for a recommendation. She recommended the snapper dish. So I ordered that. Then the server came back to tell me the snapper was still frozen solid. The chef recommended I get the red fish but I did not want that. So I got the swordfish.  It was good but I was disappointed.  The waitress was friendly and took good care of us. I said well get me a discount since you didn't have what I wanted. No discount and no manager came out to apologize for not having dishes ready to go for a Friday lunch. We will probably come back but are disappointed in this trip to one of our favorite restaurants. You would think they would have better customer service and have all menu items prepped for the weekend!,0
4,"Tried this place for the first time on a Saturday for a late lunch/early dinner. LOVE LOVE LOVE the low carb Naruto Roll, but it only comes with 5 pieces :( .... I would adding more healthy rolls wrapped in cucumber and soy paper like this to the menu. The Sashimi prices are a little high...All in all we loved the mix of Japanese/ Korean food and the service, although the choice in music wasn't up to par.",2
2,"I was in town on business and feeling on the edge of a cold and I was really looking forward to a healthy salad, but unfortunately I didn't have the best experience. I ordered the Chopped Med Salad and there was so much oily dressing that it leaked through the take out bag and puddled at the bottom. The menu also indicated it had greens, but in fact it was on a bed of iceberg, which I find a bit shocking for a vegetarian restaurant. Where is the nutrition value in that? The only plus was getting a free (tasty) lemonade because I checked in on FourSquare. Overall I found it bland, boring and uninspired for a veggie place.",0
4,"Yum! I love the Black Thorn Pub. Probably top 5 best slices in St. Louis. The place is majorly dive-y. Ladies, don't wear a skirt. You do not want bare legs touching any seat in the house. The service is, well, pretty non existent. I always sit in the back booths when I go and my husband usually places the order and gets the food. BUT I do always get a friendly hello and goodbye when I leave. I chose this place last night as my ""Last Fat Meal"" before I start my annual January diet (a week in, already sucks). Boy, oh, boy did BTP not disappoint. This time, my pals and I got the garlic bread. To my most happy surprise, it was garlic cheese bread. Honestly, I was not expecting much since the place definitely has that minimalist, we-do-one-thing-great-and-that's-pizza vibe, but it was awesome! Highly recommend. Beer was not ice cold, which is kind of a pet peeve of mine. Other than that, no complaints. LOVE.",2
4,"Great dive bar on Central we had a quick adult beverage at prior to seeing Donavon Frankenreiter at the State Theater. Be prepared to smell like smoke when you leave, though.Staff and the regulars are very friendly here. They also welcome our four legged friends too!!I love this place because it reminds me of my favorite dive bar in Tampa, the Tiny Tap.",2
2,"The food was good. It really was. I don't think it's better than a number of other restaurants - Cavan, La Petite Grocery, Lillette, Cochon, etc. - but it was good. However, the atmosphere is so-so. Very loud. Worse than that, 'market price' for a dozen oysters is $45. Yes, it's my fault for not asking. However, I think it's a reasonable assumption that oysters in New Orleans are going to be less than $20/dozen. So to list oysters at market price and to not inform the guests that they are west coast oysters seems disingenuous. I might just be complaining because I paid $90 for 24 oysters, but they honestly weren't even that good. Superior Seafood's oysters are much better. Again - my fault - but it still seems fishy.",0
3,"Hobnobber is close to my office, and the older male employees make a point to go here weekly. Possibly more than weekly. There really isn't a lot of variety around the 8000 block of Airline in Metairie. Hobnobber is somewhat close by on West Metairie Ave.Anyway, in the ~2 years that I've worked at my current job, I hadn't tried Hobnobber. I'm not really a seafood fan and their menu consists of a lot of seafood entrees. If you like seafood, this might be the place for you. I finally gave in and accompanied some co-workers last week. They recommended the Italian entrees, if I wasn't in the mood for seafood. I opted for the eggplant parmesan. While I didn't have high expectations, it was really quite good. I've had better, mind you, but for a quick and reasonably priced lunch, it was nice. Plus, it's a convenient location (for me).If you are in a hurry, you might want to call ahead and place an order to-go. It's a small space with limited seating, particularly at lunch. Also, if dining in, note that it's one of those places where you order at the counter, the server brings your food, and then you eat. They have a small, limited selection salad bar by the serve-yourself drink machine.Overall, I wouldn't make the trip here if I had more time for lunch. But, in a pinch, it's good homemade food at a good price.",1
3,"Friendly service, received our food quickly, came by our table several times to check on drinks and our satisfaction with our meals. We will come back here again! Very tasty!",1
5,"I was recently in an accident where someone hit the passenger side of my car, and with my car being a lease I was paranoid and super frustrated. However, Ken, Service Manager, helped alleviate my worries. From when I first called first thing in the morning following the accident up until I picked up my car from being repaired a week later I had nothing but pleasant exchanges with him. Ken walked me through each and every step and made me feel comfortable with the work that was going to be done, as well as provided the lowest quote as compared to the other body shops I checked out.  I would definitely recommend Ken and his team not only because they completed the work in a timely fashion, but also because their communication and follow through was super helpful in a very stressful situation.",2
4,"This place is great, flavorful Italian food, beautifully prepared and presented without being fussy.Took the parents and ladyfriend for dinner last weekend.  It wasn't super crowded at 6:30 pm when we arrived so I got a little nervous.  I needn't have feared though; by the time we finished dinner at 9:30 (more about that later) the place was packed.  I guess it's just one of those places where people dine later in the evening.Our server was excellent.  Very attentive without being obtrusive.  He described all of the specials on the extensive list by memory, speaking slowly and clearly rather than spouting them off in a Micro Machines voice like some waitstaff tend to do.  To start we had the grilled polenta with broccoli de rabe, mussels in tomato broth, and the grilled eggplant.  All three were exceptional.  My favorite was the eggplant; it could not have been prepared any more perfectly, and I'm not even a huge eggplant fan.For the main course, I ordered fileted Branzino-as did the ladyfriend-which was prepared in a tomato sauce and served with steamed asparagus.  The fish was melt-in-your-mouth and light yet flavorful.  The asparagus was OK; I prefer asparagus sauteed or grilled.  My dad ordered the fish stew which was also excellent.  My mom ordered veal filet mignon, which I did not taste but judging from her oohs and aahs, was just about perfect.For dessert we just had coffee/cappuccinos, which were very good.  Throughout the 3 hours we sat there, service was excellent .  We never felt rushed at all, despite the restaurant filling up as the night wore on.  My mom remarked that the server waited until we had all finished eating before clearing away any plates (it's a pet peeve of hers when servers take plates away while someone is still eating).  The BYO thing is great, of course.  Oh and you won't believe how reasonable the prices are, especially once you see the high quality food that comes out of the kitchen.",2
1,"I don't know if you can see it from the pic I uploaded but there's sauce covered straws, hair, crumbs and red soda all over the table they sat us at. I asked the waitress to clean it up. She wouldn't. We left before getting our food. Super gross.",0
1,"This is the worst Hertz location. I rent a car once or twice a week for work and have been to a lot of Hertz locations. The customer service is poor, the car pick up location is inconvenient and the cars never have a full tank of gas. Let me share with you some lessons learned, which the Hertz people should tell you but don't:1. Before you leave the rental counter, make sure you have a parking ticket to exit the garage.2. I have never rented a car from this location with a full tank of gas. They tell you it has a ""little less than full"". How the heck do you return a car ""a little less than full""? I always end up filling up the tank for them because I don't know when to stop pumping. 3. The cars used to be in the downstairs garage of 30th St station. Not anymore.  Go out the rental office and make a right, up the ramp until you find the escalator. Take escalator up. Walk across the overpass and take the escalators down. Leave the building and cross the walkway to the rental cars, which are outdoors. So, if it is raining or snowing, good luck.4. Take parking ticket from lesson 1 to exit the parking area.5. Upon return, just park in any spot and bring your keys back to the rental counter (back into the building, up the escalator, across the overpass, down the escalator, across the length of the station) to return the keys. Don't expect a verbal confirmation of your total, don't expect a smile or someone wishing you a good day. Just walk away vowing to take a cab the next time.",0
1,"Update, it's been well over a month now, but multiple attempts to get It Can Fit to come fix/replace the couch have failed. They haven't even bothered responding to my review and even if I get them on the phone, I can't rely on them to stick to any appointments they offer.If you are looking to move soon, my advice would be to find a more professional mover way ahead of time. These guys (ICF) were available last minute and I decided to bite with the lower rate that they quoted, but do yourself a favor and plan your move ahead of time and don't think too much about any slight price difference. It would be worth it to go with a professional moving company.",0
1,$150 admin fee and $40 a month for a tiny gym that is barely ever open? No thanks.,0
5,"Food was fantastic, view perfect, atmosphere is quaint. It was a gorgeous day to sit in the patio we had the corned beef eggs and hash, and the banana foster French toast as well as a burger, it was all delicious! The waitress was super sweet also.",2
1,"Horrible, old, cigarette smelly (even tho we requested smoke-free); room was never serviced during our 2-night stay, toilet starting leaking the morning we left. Needs a complete, total, expensive remodel!!!",0
5,The room was clean and super comfortable.  Everything worked well.  The staff was friendly.  The bar had a nice happy hour.  The location was great - close enough to be easy to get to the action but far enough to be quiet while you're trying to sleep.  The courtyard was enjoyable.  The wifi worked great (but does require you to log in way too often).  The bathrooms were large and clean.  The pool was *very* cold (probably the only negative thing we have to say about the place).  We would definitely stay again!,2
1,"I don't know this for sure, but my first impression of this place is that it is run by unscrupulous people. Come along with me, as I journey back in time -- all the way back to Wednesday...I step foot in this 7 Eleven, and the first thing I think is: this is one of the nicest looking 7 Elevens I've ever seen. It is very clean, bright, and spacious. Very nice looking selection of prepared meals. There were many that actually looked like they'd be quite good. But I wasn't hungry this day. No. All I needed were a few items. First, some good old TP. And let me be perfectly clear (as clear as Barack Obama): I DON'T buy the cheapest toilet paper because I'm cheap. I buy it because I like the way the cheap stuff feels. The more like sandpaper, the better. I like to feel like its working. I don't need to or even want to feel like an angel is up there. Or some perverted freak named Scott. In any case, I got myself 4 rolls. And then I just needed one more thing - some plastic cups for a little party I'm having this weekend. I go ahead and drop my stash on the counter, begin to extract several singles from my wallet, when the cashier looks at me and says, ""24.99.""I respond, ""That's not right.""He points at a price tag on the plastic cups which reads 19.99. I begin laughing. I tell him the price is clearly wrong. He tells me he's got to talk to his manager. Meanwhile, I tell the folks behind me waiting in line that I'm just going to go run and get different plastic cups to hurry the process along. Before he got back from doing his price check, I already had another cashier ringing up my two sleeves of cups for 1.99 each. That's more like it.At around that same moment, the first cashier comes back from his consultation with his manager. He tells me that the price was, in fact, incorrect. And that the price is actually 14.99.THAT'S the unscrupulous part.CLEARLY, THAT price is also far too high. His manager did no actual price check at all. He simply told the cashier to pretend that the real price was actually 5 dollars less, thinking that I'd be stupid enough to accept this. Why, because I'm white, and you're a racially superior Indian? You think white people are stupid don't you? We'll just believe what you tell us, and fork over our money.",0
5,"An endorsement from the target audience: my three-year-old daughter loves this place and asks to be taken here all the time. I'm usually happy to oblige because it's a perfect place to enjoy time outdoors when the weather is nice. She can run and play in a safe and engaging environment, and it's not like somewhere like Sesame Place where you have to run around frantically to ensure that you get your $40-per-person's worth. This place is $6 a pop and the pleasures are low-key: there is a carousel, a train, tunnels to play hide-and-seek in, scenes from fairy tales like the three little pigs' houses, the tea party from Alice in Wonderland, and giant's chair from Jack and the Beanstalk, a little playhouse with toy food, musical instruments to play, fountains in the summertime, a sandbox with dinosaur ""fossils"" in the bottom, stuff like that. It seems like every weekend there's some themed event with craft tables or exhibits; one time, for instance, a paleontologist from the state museum was there with a giant mastodon femur that he had dug up, and there are holiday events like a Halloween trick-or-treating parade. Employees are friendly, grounds are full of flowers and shady trees (lots of nice willows to sit under). Been here many times, will be back many times.",2
5,Excellent venue for a quick lunch! NY style pizza accompanied by a delicious fresh salad.  They offer Daily weekday specials.  The best part is sitting out on the shady patio.,2
1,"I really wanted to be able to leave a good review, this place is within walking distance so the location is super convenient.  Basically, the food is mediocre, which is fine, I can handle so-so tasting food. It's the experience portion of dining here that caused such a low review. I saw the good and bad reviews, but I'm fair and like to judge from my own experience, so I came in with neutral expectations. I came in with a group of six people. We ordered separately, I was the first to order. However, our food took 25 minutes, and when we asked what the holdup was, no one seemed to know or care. We did end up letting them know the service was poor, and the guy I was explaining to walked away as I was speaking! He flat out did not care.  At this point, that's just plain rude. We tried to complain to the woman managing the floor and her response was, ""oh.""  Apparently, we weren't the only ones complaining, as we were walking out, another customer walked in to get her money back because her boyfriend has already been served and finished his food while she still hadn't gotten hers. This place has potential, but until they realize that service is an equally important part of the restaurant experience, they probably won't even try to improve. Such a bummer.",0
2,"The food is ""JUST OK"" only thing here worth traveling for is the different beers on tap and good conversationIn response to the GM who responded to my reviewit's impressive you stand by your staffBut my opinion is my opinion. and I stand by what I wrote... I took shots at no oneBut your request that I stay away, will be honored!Best Wishes",0
4,"Great flavors, solid service, only a few things lacking on the execution (a little bit of clumping in my grits, brussels sprouts a little too spicy for a breakfast dish).",2
5,"First of all, cash only. Which they prominently display, but if you're reading this and didn't catch that in the yelp description, you'd be missing out on delicious food. They have a decent menu of tacos, tortas etc. In addition they have a large variety of serve yourself condiments that are delicious and make the food that much better. It's outdoor seating but they have a tent so you are in the shade. I would recommend absolutely this as an affordable and delicious lunch option!",2
5,Very great. The owner came and spoke with us. That is always a good sign. The waiter was great and the food outstanding.,2
5,Ice cream here is excellent! Made fresh and you can tell. The flavors shine through and taste it. Their sauces are also homemade and were great,2
4,"I think if I could, I would give Zen Yai a 3.5 stars, but alas, c'est la vie. The prices for their curry are excellent, at less than $12. Zen Yai is a tiny place, which is both good and bad. Good if you don't have to wait, because it is nice and cozy, but bad if enough people eat here on a given evening -- because you may just have to wait a while.I like the decor a lot, and the use of colors. The tables and plates are full of refreshingly bright colors. The service was fine, and the food was at our table in no time.My Pineapple curry was excellent! And the rice is served in the shape of a pyramid, which is fun. All that being said, my girlfriend had a less than pleasurable experience. She is a seasoned green curry lover, and was disappointed with their green curry offering.",2
4,"Being from California, we didn't have Waffle House. We grew up with IHOP...Or as it was originally called by its full name: International House of Pancakes.  I generally prefer IHOPs to Waffle Houses. Both are cool in that they are open 24 hours, but IHOP seems to have a larger menu and more variety. ...Especially on their breakfast items. They get seasonal options that I like as well.This particular IHOP is fairly near to where we live, so it's convenient. It's also right off the Interstate and it seems like its always got a steady crowd there. There are 2 motels next to it and Rummel High School is around the corner. From the various times I have been here, it seems to be a mix of high school students and out of town visitors.I like going at night best and ordering breakfast. Breakfast is served all day. If you don't feel like breakfast, they have a lunch and dinner selection instead.The staff at this location have always been friendly and we've never had any problems.It's an interesting place to people watch and enjoy some yummy pancakes.",2
4,"I took the kids here for lunch the other day while they were on Spring Break. I've been here a few times and forgot to review it. Dong's is the best Chinese Buffet in the area. The one thing I don't like is you have to wait on the waitress for your drinks, I'd prefer to be able to get my own refills. They have a large selection of food. They keep the buffet fresh also. During my last visit they were constantly switching out their food and adding freshly cooked food. The only thing they're missing on their buffet is Black Pepper Chicken, maybe they have it on the dinner buffet. I've never been here for dinner so I don't know what changes on the dinner buffet. For lunch though, this is definitely a go to spot if your in the mood for chinese.",2
1,"I chose to try this salon out because it was close to home and I needed my solar nails removed and I wanted gel instead. They clearly didn't know how to remove solar as they spent an hour scraping it off after the initial  soak. They proceed to do gel, but she coated my skin more than the nail and after several redos finally finished. A few days later, the gel is coming up. Never will return.",0
5,"I got my hair cut here yesterday and I can honestly say it's one of the best haircuts I've ever received! Michelle helped me find the cut I've always been looking for. I came in with an idea of the cut I wanted and she helped me with the missing pieces in a courteous and professional manner. The atmosphere in the salon is relaxed and professional. I'm only going here to get hair done, from now on!",2
5,"Great food, great atmosphere, great service. I've been here twice, and neither was a disappointment. The food is always fantastic (if a bit on the pricey side) - maybe it's because I'm a sucker for Nutella, but the Belgian Waffle topped with Nutella is Heaven for your mouth.",2
2,Not sure if it's right that sushi was warm when it came to the table. Service was sloooooooow.,0
1,"I tried to like this place... I really did. So much so that I went back to try it after a less that satisfactory first wax.Wax 1- I had Despina, I think her name was. I waited a good 15 minutes after my appointment time for her to come and get me from the front. Ironic they have a 9 minute policy that if you don't show they'll cancel/charge you or whatever. Anyway, as for the experience with Despina, she did not speak to me. Like at all. Made me feel super awkward the whole time, and missed a fair few chunks of hair. She didn't ask me anything about myself, didn't tell me where to sit or how she wanted me positioned etc. Luckily I got this one half price as it was my first time at EWC.Wax 2- I booked 3-4 weeks later with Amy Jo (based on previous Yelp reviews). She was a lot friendlier (literally the only reason why I'm giving this 1 star) BUT way too sloppy. I think it's safe to say this is the worst wax I've ever had. She left half of my hair on right before Valentine's Day! I understand they can't get all the hairs all the time but a lottttt of hair right on top was left clearly visible to my waxer. My apt was at 3.45, I walked out of the building at 3.53. Really. This includes the time spent undressing, redressing, and paying. 8 minutes is not long enough for all of this. It went so quick that when she said she was done I was actually shocked.  I'm about to go to CVS and get some at home wax strips to finish the job... For $47+ I expect way way more. The staff- Another reason why I won't be returning. The ladies at the front desk are generally rude and disinterested in showing any glimpse of good customer service. ALSO, I don't like being asked if I'm going to tip - can't you give me the card machine so I can do it myself rather than make me announce if I would like to tip and how much? The hunt for a decent Brazilian wax in Philly continues- someone help me PLEASE!",0
5,Love this place!  Been going back once a week for the past two years.  There is usually a wait but the line moves quickly and have never had a bad sandwich.,2
3,Great selection of mixed drinks  & beers! & a nice atmosphere :)The customer service was 5 stars... Very Friendly! The food wasn't the best very average - the cheese dip w/ the pretzels was funny tasting.. & the chicken asparagus was pretty bad.,1
3,"I miss Mexically, but if you can't make the trek/wait in line for Don Memos then this is a decent option.  Most recently I had the chicken tostada.  It was a ton of food, but it didn't wow me.  The flavors are kind of bland.  I wish they didn't charge for guacamole.  It's cheap, quick Mexican style food.",1
5,"For my boyfriend's 31st birthday, I decided to take him to Ruth Chris because it's a steakhouse and we've heard nothing but good reviews and it's true. It was both our first time coming here, and overall everything was great. There was valet parking you payed for and our reservations were for 8:30, we got sat at that time as well.Our waiters were very friendly and understood it was our first time. I have to say the steak was beyond amazing! By far the best steak I've ever had and I've had my fair share. I got the side of mash potato, he got a baked potato as his side and the bread they serve you with pretty good. I forgot the names of our steaks, which were both different but they were perfect. Buttery, cooked well, not too burnt, just great. The tab was pricey, but you pay for what you get and that is excellent steak. It was a great experience, I'm actually dying to go back and I'd definitely recommend to anyone else.",2
4,"I frequent the HOB in Oldsmar about once/month, or so. I've drank there more than ate but have had the caesar salad for dinner before;it was pretty small but a great price. The buffalo chicken dip is DELISH as are the chicken nachos. The key is to go before 7pm for their happy hour, which includes half off their appetizers. They also have $5 beer night on Thursdays. You can bring up to a LITER mug of your own and they will fill it for $5. The place is small but the atmosphere was fun. HOB would be the neighboorhood bar if there were more things on this strip of street to do...we have a good time and it was a pretty chill atmosphere.",2
5,"I booked a spa appointment here while I was in town. I did the Voodoo Love massage and bath. It was a very cool experience. The massage was awesome, there were red rose petals on the floor leading into the room, the room was dark except for the red candles burning and voodoo drum music to complete the effect. the massage oil was made from a love oil apparently derived from a recipe from the famed Marie Laveau. The bath, which was after the massage was pretty much the same..red candles and drum music. The water was covered with rose petals and more love oil in the bath water. the whole experience was great. I'd do it again",2
3,"Tropical Isle is tacky, but they have a signature and requisite blow-your-brains-out specialty drink, the Hand Grenade (complete with stupid cup), which is the stupidness-delivery weapon of chice for the polo shirt wearing-beads set.  Two for one during daylight hours, most days.",1
5,"Stopped by for a quick lunch. Very pleased to find a nice salad on the menu! Also have Sirloin sandwich, a hot chicken sandwich wrap and a tempting New Nashville Burger. My big salad only cost $6. Can't wait to try their dinner menu sometime.",2
5,"Best Thai food in the area. Great decor and friendly staff, they will always remember you.",2
5,Celiacs in the area def need to check out this place!They have a number of gluten free options and accommodate to preventing cross contamination to the best of their abilities if you mention your dietary needs.My fav thing from there is their chicken quesadillas.,2
3,"Friends rave(d) about Honey's. We had some time to kill before a flight back to CA, so we stopped here with some friends who live in the area. It was Labor Day, and I was surprised they were even open. We did have to wait 40 minutes for a table, and this was at 11:30. We found parking on the street, which was surprisingly easier to find than expected. Honey's had indoor and outdoor seating, we chose the inside seating because it was HOT and no shade. We got the biggest table in the joint and were seated with menus and beverages. It has a homey style to it.There is a plethora of brunch options. I heard the pancakes are huge, and some items such as the breakfast bomb just seemed like too much food. I chose the open faced biscuit sandwich with veggie sausage and gravy. I also got the home fries, but could have had grits, hash browns or latke. My friends got omelettes (designed) and the bomb. I couldn't finish my food as it was too much, and I got the smaller menu item. Service was great-we never ran out of coffee, tea or fresh squeezed OJ. I would say try it once before making it a go-to destination.",1
4,"Stopped in for a late lunch today. Special of the day was catfish with shrimp jambalaya and greens. Catfish and jambalaya were great! I am not a fan of greens but tried them anyway. Still not a fan. Dish came with warm cornbread. Food was scalding hot! Kudos for that! Had the BBQ oyster appetizer, it was ok. Peach cobbler for dessert was excellent! A bit pricey, but food was good and service was excellent.",2
5,"This place is great!  The prices are reasonable for the quality of the clothes you find; most of what they carry is either new or like-new.  I always love finding the original price tags, even if they don't show the original prices.  Definitely check out the shoes and clearance area!Workers are nice, and tend to keep to themselves, though they are very attentive when you ask for help.",2
5,"I always get greeted with a smile here. It's always clean and well stocked. The salad bar is fresh, deli is efficient, and baked goods always fresh too. The pharmacy staff are excellent too. They know who I am and ask me how things are going with genuine interest.",2

Honestly, come to this place and you will not be disappointed.",2
4,"Excellent food and bar. Slow service.A friend and I stopped here during an evening of bar hopping in the CBD. We were seated promptly and given our menus, which are half-French, half-English. Not a big deal for anyone who can read French and/or has been living in Louisiana for a reasonable amount of time, but definitely something tourists should be wary of. I didn't have any alcohol because I was the designated driver, but I can say that their drink menu is extensive, and the bar was packed from the moment we arrived until the moment we left. This restaurant's biggest strength is it's food. I tasted their crab bisque, and had Poulet Grand-Mère as my entrée. Both were excellent. The latter arrived in a wide cast-iron bowl, which I'm sure has a more proper name, but was an interesting touch nonetheless.The service was why I gave this restaurant 4/5 instead of 5/5. Most of the wait staff seemed to be interns from culinary school. The handful we dealt with were very friendly, but would do well to be a little more attentive. For example, the server who brought us our desserts ran off before we could ask for spoons to eat the dessert with. In summary, a good dining experience, but I think I would rather continue exploring new restaurants in the area before returning.",2
5,"Easily my favorite hotel in Philadelphia.  Well located in Center City and the rooms are exquisitely designed.

4,"Visited on a Sunday night, 8:30-11. 9-11 is Yuengling $2 pint drafts and $3 bottles. We came in a group, a Yelp after party, if you will. You were wonderfully accommodating, and  I promised I'd mention that server Dan P was especially attentive and accommodating of our crowd.I think the drinks came perfectly balanced, which is very nice. Sometimes you love when drinks come strong, but they're not necessarily delicious. Here, you get booze, but also scrumptiousness. You treated our group to kamikazes--- thanks, they were great!Also, in addition to a plethora of drinks, we got the nachos and the ""awesome fries."" These were fantastic, like over-the-top perfect for satisfying grease cravings while drinking... DELICIOUS. Even without happy hour specials, this was a great night for service, food, drinks, and the game- thanks for having both soccer and football on screens all over the freaking place. :)",2

4,"Really liked this place. It was a bit busy as it was a Sunday morning when we visited so I feel like our waitress was a bit overwhelmed however, the food was so good. I love the fresh and healthy options. I had avocado smashed w/olive oil and salt over toast and their fresh juice. Awesome.",2

Specialty pizzas (si se Salsipuedes!) are worth the line at the counter.  Wish the obnoxious guys in front of us had just left before the manager had to make them (thank you!).  Tasty pizza still made up for it.  Oh!  and how does a pizza parlor have a better wine list than ""the club?!""",2
5,My go to breakfast joint whenever I'm in Mount Laurel. They have great omelets and ambiance. Wish I knew about them years ago. They always offer me free coffee to go when I leave. Love them!,2
4,Service is great.  Food varies on what you order.  Had breakfast for dinner one night and it was fabulous.  Had a ribeye another evening and it came out unseasoned and grisly.  Waitress was sweet.  Ask for Alicia when you come.  She really cares about your experience here.  I will eat there again as it is proximate to my hotel but it's worth driving to eat there as well.  Just be careful what you order.  Breakfast for days - steak not so much.,2
4,"A solid B to B+. I tried the falafel plate, which came with rice and a small salad, as well as a few slices of pita bread. The falafel had a nice subtle flavor; not overpowering but definitely not bland. I tend to prefer my falafel's inside consistency a little less dense, if that's the right description, but it was a nice flavor and a good cook for a nice crunchy outside. The rice was cooked perfectly (I can't stand an overlooked mushy rice) but didn't have a whole lot of flavor. It was light and refreshing, but not spectacular. The drizzle over the top (tahini? laban?) was a nice addition. Overall very nice food, a solid B-B+.",2
2,Meh. I don't understand all the rave reviews for this place.  Got a gel manicure that only lasted about a week and a half - mine normally last at least 3 weeks.  On one of my nails the polish chipped at the cuticle within a few hours.  Ambiance less than fantastic. Cheap.  But I won't go back.,0

5,AWESOME thai place. Went for lunch and the service was snappy and friendly and everything we ordered was fresh and incredibly flavorful. Really comfy/cool ambiance and you can sort of watch them cooking the food in the big woks. Definitely going to frequent this place. A bonus: they sell cute t-shirts with elephants on them.,2
5,"I've been here for several blow outs and I highly recommend! The entire staff is talented and I love how you can book online. I usually see Krissy or Bianca, but everyone is great and super friendly. I also recommend getting a vital shot with your blow out. It is a deep conditioning product that doesn't add extra time to your visit but makes all the difference! I am blonde so I am always trying to keep my hair conditioned, and the vital shot lasts about a week!",2
4,"As soon as I walked in, I knew I did the right thing in getting the Yelp deal. I ordered some Pho, Summer rolls, and the Basil Chicken. It's been a long time since I've had Pho and while the broth and accompaniments were on point, I remembered why it had been so long since having it. Too much involved with the noodles and the broth and then of course I over did it with the sriracha! But still -- very flavorful. I should have gone with the Pho with chicken instead of the Pho with Eye-Round steak, Flank, Fat Brisket, Tendon & Tripe. The Basil chicken was beyond amazing. I have to admit, I did not think I'd eat the whole portion, but I did. It was 2pm and I hadn't eaten all day so needless to say, I was starving!! The amount of veggies in this dish was great. Eggplant, snow pea pods, green, red, yellow and orange peppers, mushrooms, string beans! But that special spicy sauce. OMG I could eat that like it was soup. Delish! I keep on forgetting what the summer roll is and each time I order it, I wanna smack myself for not remembering. I don't really like the wrapper. Pardon me for being vulgar, but it reminds me of a condom. I meant to order the rolls that are fried! Oh well, next time I'll get it right. Overall, for my first time ordering here, I was pleased.  I'd definitely recommend the Yelp Deal. I wish I was able to find a menu online, otherwise I would have ordered ahead of time!",2
5,"Walked in for eyebrow threading and this was my first time experience... Samira was awesome. She had very good customer service and made me feel comfortable since I didn't know what to expect. I love my eyebrows now! They are super clean and it was a quick process. Thank you, Samira!",2
5,"What a great way to spend the afternoon!   We (5 girls celebrating our 30th birthdays) agreed that we had to do some sort of swamp tour while we were in NOLA in April.  We booked online and drove ourselves the 35 minutes to Slidell (for a few bucks more, you can get shuttled there).  We showed up right at our tour time, so we were worried that we wouldn't have enough time to check in, use the restroom, and get to the boat before it left.  Thankfully for us, Canjun Encounters offered a ""late"" boat for us tardy folks, which left 15 minutes after our scheduled tour time.  Whew.  Our guide, Captain Troy, was fantastic.  He took us quickly up the river, stopping occasionally to give us some interesting factoids about the area.  Then, we quietly floated into the swamp.  It's gorgeous!  And Captain Troy continued to give us more great info about the swamp and its inhabitants.  Due to the unseasonably cold weather, we didn't see any alligators up close.  However, we did get to pass around someone's pet baby alligator.  Too cool!  And we got to see someother wildlife, like birds, turtles, snakes, and spiders.  I guess my only complaint is that we used a covered boat, which hindered our view of the swamp a little bit.  Other than that, our swamp experience with Cajun Encounters was fantastic.  Highly recommended!*Tip: go to Southside Cafe for lunch.  It's only a few miles away, and the food was AMAZING.",2
5,"This culvers is always busy, and hasn't gotten an order wrong yet. Its pretty good, like the same as any other good culvers. The service is nice too, I think they might leave their cheese curds out too long- not always fresh. But I'd reccommend.",2
5,"Very happy with my experience here the other day. Couldn't get into my regular doctor due to scheduling issues so I figured I'd try the urgent care near work. Including paperwork, seeing PA, and getting Rx- I was in and out in 30 mins. They didn't have me sitting in the room waiting for long periods of time to see the PA either. Staff was very nice and didn't seem bothered that I came in close to the end of their night. They also called me the day after to make sure I didn't have further questions. Would definitely recommend to others.",2
5,my favorite pizza place in the area . friendly staff and the biggest slices of pizza anywhere . For 4.50 you can get any one of up to 10 different gourmet slices . the margherita and the buffalo chicken are not to be missed . great outdoor dining area I frequently ride my bicycle there have a slice and Ride it off home. nice small dining room in the back .,2
5,Wow! Excellent service and the best calamari I have ever had. The beer was good and atmosphere friendly. Nothing negative about this place at all!,2
5,"Both times I have gone to Mojo it has delivered! Danny our server was very attentive and gave us great recommendations; I don't think we would have gotten all we did if he didn't sell everything so well. Every night they have some type of pitcher deal for their drinks which is nice. 25% off a different cocktail pitcher every night is such a great deal!Get the Seared Ahi Tuna, Baked Goat Cheese and Blue Cheese Stuffed Bacon Wrapped Dates!! Those were definitely a favorite between my boyfriend and I.",2
5,"We can't wait to come back!Okay so we decided to come to New Orleans for my 30th birthday and stay with The Ace. We asked for a few things to be in the room before we arrived and Oz at the front desk went so far above and beyond to make that happen for us. Literally what a star. Allison and Cici helped us out during our stay as well and both are rock stars. Sadly, these are the only names I have but I can say that everyone was so nice to us and made our stay so wonderful. The rooms are spacious and perfect for the vibe of the hotel. Great products in the bathroom, comfy beds and blackout curtains perfect for sleeping in. They're totally hooked up for music with a record player as well as an intuitive Bluetooth set up. Awesome minibar with all the fixings and a full fridge, which was great to have for all the leftover fried food you accumulate in Nola. We didn't get a chance to eat at the restaurant, but it looks adorable. The lounge has super yummy cocktails and there is usually complimentary popcorn to snack on. Attached is a Stumptown Coffee which was so convenient for us as we head out to explore! There's a rooftop pool and bar/restaurant called Alto that is so fun! Heads up, it is open to the public so it can get crowded. That said, we didn't have a hard time finding some chaises to set up on. The Eternal Summer was my favorite drink up here. We actually made it to the gym. Once. It was great - clean towels, cold water, full set of weights and a couple treadmills. All good but we didn't spend much time here. I think that covers it! Really looking forward to returning.",2
5,"Five words: Peanut Butter Chocolate Milk Stout. Dear gawd I love this stuff! Keep in mind I was skeptical. I usually stick with Single Speed, which is on the complete opposite end of the spectrum, but when literally every other person you are with is drinking this ""Reeses cup beer"" you eventually take a sip, and discover that it is delicious and you kick Single Speed to the curb and end up roaming around Randall's like a crazy person until the nice girl stocking beer notices you and carries over a bottle asking ""is this what you're looking for?"" and you want to hug her. But I digress....  If you can't track down the peanut butter, their regular chocolate milk stout runs a close second in my book, and this is coming from someone who is not a big fan of dark beers. Maybe my taste buds are changing with old age, who knows. I have my fingers crossed that they won't take it away as the weather warms up!The tasting room is probably one of my current favorite spaces. It's all concrete and metal a distressed wood and an awesome wall of custom ""wallpaper"" (it's a stencil). It's gets crazy crowded in here on weekends, but the bartenders are efficient and it never takes long to get a refill. They also have limited seating outside on the sidewalk, which is awesome on warm days, and they generally have an amazing soundtrack going. If drinking round after round of beer gives you the drunk munchies (no? just me?) you can grab a snack from Fifth Wheel, which is basically a tiny Bailey's kitchen that offers up nachos, pretzels and other pub fare to go along with your beer. Order and pay at the window and they come find you when you're food is ready.",2
1,"Not impressed by the food or service.  Visited them for brunch about month ago and will not be back.  Overpriced mimosas ($7 each for a small champagne flute is ridiculous) and the food was just average.  My husband and I left because we felt very uncomfortable after the table next to us ordered salad, which they were out of lettuce, then french toast, which they were out of syrup, and a couple of other items I can't recall.  Oh, and no table visit by a manager!! I can't believe this place is still in business.  Our bill was $50 for 4 small mimosas, an egg & cheese bagel, and an omlet!  What a ripoff!!!",0
4,"I love shopping at Ross Stores. I stop at every one I come across. Yes, much of the merchandise is the same, but once in a while, you find a gem. It really is a treasure hunt. They carry a selection of ""as seen on Tv"" stuff, a slew of Jr's clothing, a decent selection of ladies and missy, but they generally fail at plus, men's and petite.  These markets are woefully represented. Sure they have a men's section, but looking through the stuff, it's crappy t shirts and fubu jeans. Hardly anything the men in my life would wear.This particular store's selection of lingerie/under garments is sad. They don't have a good variety of lingerie other than bras and panties.  Their home goods is very nicely situated as are their bed and bath items ... and their shoes!! My goodnes, their shoes are to die for!One rhing I've noticed recently is that they are carrying many more high end designers: Michael Kors, Calvin Klein, and others at decent prices. So it does pay to shop at Ross.",2
4,"Great for a casual night out. The grilled Catfish was OK, but I loved the Harbor potatoes. I would go back to try a few other items on their menu.",2
3,"Had lunch at Carrabbas yesterday and if it weren't for the attentiveness and professionalism of the bartenders we would never return to this establishment. We waited over an hour and a half for food and asked to speak with a manger maybe 20 times during the entire experience, needless to say he never came over. Jen and Marcus handled everything perfectly, which is the only reason I'm rating this place 3 stars. It was happy hour and they kept us entertained and in good spirits while we waited forever to eat. When the food finally arrived everything was delicious. Marcus recommended The Johnny with fettuccine Alfredo and it was excellent. My wife also enjoyed the Johnny Rocco salad. We would definitely dine here regularly once all of the kinks are worked out but management needs to realize that this is New Orleans there are plenty of place to enjoy good food. Take care of your guest.",1
4,"They have a few locations, and we picked the one that is in more of a residential area than a busy center of the city. There was no line when we arrived shortly after 11am. But, it was still busy, it can get crowded very quickly with a very small interior. They have five counter seats, and that is about it. While we were there, most of them were there to purchase the food to go, so the seats were not in high demand.Even though this is mainly a donut shop, they also offer enticing fried chicken. We ordered their very popular Fried Chicken Sandwich, available from 11am. It was smaller than I thought it would be, but I always take quality over quantity. It was juicy, tasty, with a nice little kick to it. We really enjoyed it!We couldn't just order chicken from a donuts shop, so we got a couple of donuts from their Hot Donuts selections. We chose Cookies & Cream and Strawberry Lavender. We both liked the strawberry one better, since it had better, stronger flavor. Cookies & Cream was good but didn't have much flavor. Definitely a place to visit if you are visiting Philly!",2
5,Awesome I can't wait to go again next year best attraction around.Almost feels real in some of the houses.Haunted hayride was spectacular with fire torches machine guns chainsaws Churches demonic preist.Walking in the woods with a little glow stick is awesome and scary.Very real feeling.FORGET bush gardens howl o scream and haloween horror nights all you need is screamagedon.,2
5,"The Phillies did an unbelievable job with the new park.  A great place to see a game and I've never had a bad seat.  I currently have the Sunday plan which is a great way to spend a summer afternoon.  (My seats are on the left field side and I've witnessed Philly's change of heart over Pat Burrell - loathing and booing early last year to cheers last last and this season!)Food choices are great, atmosphere is terrific.  I would rate this the 2nd best ballpark in the U.S.  Sorry, gotta give the nod to AT&T Park  in San Francisco...all the atmosphere of Citizens Bank Park but with the water and the Bay Bridge in the background instead of Packer Ave!",2
4,Went for lunch 11/28/09I posted pics of all our food.Friendly serviceCreative appetizers:-andouille stuffed fried mushrooms-special of the day appetizer smoked pork & cream cheese cakesMain Course:Big portion1/2 rack of ribs YUM!Tasted like New Orleans BBQ if I had to call it somethingRibs came with a choice of 2 sides & hush puppiesOur sides were the collard greens & cheese corn gritsWe liked it all.I ate here with my mom for lunch & shared everything.  We were so full afterwards and even had enough to go for a second lunch the next day.I would like to return to show my hubby this cool place.,2
5,"This johnny rockets is straight poppin!! Everyone that works here really knows what they are doing. We ordered food and it came out fast within like 8 minutes, despite they were extremely busy due to the hot august nights event going on. My server allie was extremely attentive, and everything we asked for came out on time with no hassles. We definetly  are a needy crowd with out extra ranch and extra sides. The manager annalee came by to check on us, and she was extremely professional. The smoke house with onion rings is a dish that i would order everytime i come. The atmosphere is great, and all the workers here really seem to get a long and have fun at work, yet they were all professional and attentive with their guest. Great job GSR johnny rockets! I will always be back for the great food, and great service!",2
5,"My boyfriend and his friends go every year for his birthday, and it's always a great place to stay with a large group even with kids. They've got everything from arcade, gym (with a room to do yoga/stretching etc!), pools, spa, club etc. I'm not much of a gambler but definitely enjoy the rest of the amenities. Rooms are definitely a tad older then others, and I would say food quality could improve and the crowd is interesting (I'll leave it at that). It's definitely not vegas but you're also not paying vegas prices.",2
4,I stopped in for lunch and everything was very good.I realy like the road kill very good with mushrooms and onions smothered with melted cheese. Good job.,2
5,"It would be a disservice to not give this hotel a speedy, excellent review.  I travel to Boise quarterly and usually stay at the grove and this hotel popped up since the Grove was booked.  I didn't realize it was brand new (opened a week before I stayed there) but looked nice in the photos. Upon arriving, the valet was prompt, staff was extremely friendly, ambience was beautiful, and they even greeted me with a glass of wine and free snacks.  The rooms are extremely spacious and even the lower level rooms feature a very modern, upscale bathroom, extremely comfortable bed, and personal fireplace.  The walls are definitely thick and sound doesn't penetrate the rooms easily.  This is an easy 5/5 stars relative to the price which was very affordable.  I will be booking my trips here every time I come to Boise.",2
1,When they make you bleed and rush the entire time you know they don't want your business. I get me nails done every 2 weeks and have never been in this much pain or had my nails be so crooked before. The nail technician insulted the style and length I requested. I specifically made a google and yelp profile so I can warn people about this place. Never going back!,0
5,I am in love with this place! ! A charmingly friendly and helpful staff. Incredibly diverse excellent spread for breakfast. Chocolate covered strawberries as a treat in the room. Great location across from Redding Terminal.  Great happy hour in the hotel bar!!,2
4,"Very nice. Pricey? Sure, but well worth it. I don't know of a whole lot to do in Nashville, but while I'm there on business, I love staying at the Opryland. It's really one of those things you just have to experience.",2
2,"Was so disappointed at Frank's yesterday when we found they were out of all fish! Who has a daily ""all you can eat"" fish fry advertised but out of fish at lunch??? So we ordered burgs and had to wait well over 30 minutes for our food. Too many other places to eat out to waste your time waiting at Franks! Oh and $20.00 for 2 cheeseburgers with 5 fries each, nah......won't be back again.",0
3,"Not a bad diner at all, but I don't know why it's considered great by so many people. Conveniently located and open all night.",1
5,"Best burger joint I've seen in a while. Nice variety on the menu as far as burger/cheesesteak/pork style sandwiches go. And they do a different special sandwich every week;which has consiquently bumped me from a semi-regular customer up to a once or twice a week reg. Service is friendly from the cashier to the fry guys to Josh and his happy helpers in the back. They're always helpful and enjoy chit chat and quick jokes. They seem to genuinely enjoy their job and social interaction. It's always fun to catch them jamming out to the eclectic rock station always playing for ambiance. Just a chill group of guys n gals.I don't want to call the space SMALL because it doesn't feel cramped. It's more like its interactive and fitting for a fast-moving burger joint. Think diner meets pizza place meets local bar type of feel. Low rise tables in front for relaxing, some hightops with a different perspective in the corner, and the bar-style counter make it so u can pick your style comfort. With paintings and articles all over, you're bound to have some conversation pieces nearby as well.Everything seems clean. From tables floors and counters, to the separate area in the back for butchering meets, to the clearly labeled bins for different trash and recyclables.Overall 5star for these guys. Try the Charlie Brown for some Philly style comfort food.",2
5,"Tanti and Papertini are AMAZING!!!! My wedding was fabulously decorated, the flowers were beautiful, everything was more perfect than I had imagined. The amount of compliments that I received about the decor, the ambiance, the special touches that Tanti created were so many I couldn't even count them! She and her team turned a nice space into OUR beautiful space. I cannot say enough about how awesome they are.",2
1,"Where I think the meat and fish selection looks fine and they carry some exotic meats in the freezer I just cannot recommend this place. I had purchased a Groupon and was pretty excited about trying this place out. When I got there I decided to walk around the entire store to see what kind of goodies I wanted to buy. Once I got around to the back of the store buy the beer, wine and dried goods I started to smell the stench of cigarettes. At first I was willing to write this off as maybe a door was open by the loading dock. But then I walked by the office with the door wide open and two people smoking openly. I choose to ask them why they were smoking in the building and all they could do was write it off as ""smoking in the office"" and ""yeah it's a dirty habit"". Not addressing that it's ILLEGAL in the state of Florida to smoke inside a business like this, you know the whole Indoor Clean Air Act. Besides I don't want to buy what is supposed to be fresh meat and the like in a place that cigarette smoke lingers in the air. The only reason I bought anything was to use my Groupon but on second thought I should have just walked out empty handed. I don't think they understand the purpose of Groupon. It is designed to get new customers in the door with the goal of becoming regular customers. In this case they scared me away from ever shopping there again. What a shame they could have something pretty nice on their hands otherwise.",0
4,"Ordered lamb stew noodles, Chinese hamburger, spicy cabbage, dumplings, and wontons. Lamb noodles were good (my opinion) or great (everyone else's opinion). Cabbage was really good, I could tell it was cooked on very high heat. Dumplings were awesome... Had a very crispy layer of crust covering it. Burger was very dry.",2
4,"Food is excellent-always. Very authentic and it's a sin for someone to get a ground beef taco in a crispy shell here, tasty as it may be- there are so many options- be adventurous! My family's favorite are the al pastor, desebrada, and chicharron. Service can be lacking at times, but almost always is good. The only thing that is an issue for us is no changing table in the bathrooms.",2
5,"I stumbled upon this shelfish shack last year when I was in town for July 4th weekend and immediately I was hooked. This place is small and located at the end of the pier, parking can be a problem sometimes, but I guess you can valet it up front or wait it out. When you walk in you cant help but notice the variety of sizes of fresh crabs and lobsters in the large aquarium tanks to your left with a guy behind the glass counter chopping and steaming them. I always order the spider crab special which starts off with a cup of clam chowder; absolutely the best Ive had thus far. They also serve a few shrimp dishes along with different lobster dishes as well, apparently lobster is available about 6 of my 10 visits. Overall you can try alot of different fresh shellfish without paying as much as you will other places offereing the same items in their menu. Now that I write about it ... I think Im going to go today ..",2
5,"This is not a typical goodwill store and it is Not an overpriced vintage clothing store either.  Sure, I may be a bit biased because I came in here looking for an affordable 2 piece suit, which I found right away!  Really nice suit that I tried on in a clean dressing room.  I just can't get over the fact that it fit so nicely and it was the only one I tried on.  The staff working here were very personable and helpful.  Did I mention it was clean?  Way better than other thrift stores I have been to.  The clothing racks were organized and it was easy to shop around.  The music was cool too.  I didn't even feel like I was shopping, not that I like to shop, but this store made it fun.  They have clean Men's and women's rest rooms.  They have accessories and plenty of other reasons to come back in.  Maybe a bit higher than goodwill, but not much and the extra quality is definitely here!",2
4,"Clean location and fast, friendly service. No indoor seating but a small amount outside. Small parking lot. Everything is always great here!",2
2,I think 312 refers to the number of minutes you'll wait before getting your food.,0
4,"Excellent food. Simple pizza parlor style menu with awesome alternatives to the Italian pie! Great mellow ambiance, super cool indie music on the speakers and super adequate service.The flatbread appetizers were amazing, and perfectly proportioned and the salads were gigantic!Great beer options as well!I will definitely be coming back again!",2
3,"Visited Richard's for brunch Saturday 2/18. Good service, but shockingly first bad meal we have had there, and we were long time frequent Cafe Vicino patrons before their move and rebranding. Potatoes that came with my eggs and bacon, and my wife's eggs and sausage we're OVERsalted to the point of being inedible. Toast was cold upon delivery. Hope this was a one-off.",1
5,We celebrated a girl-family weekend in Los Olivos. My cousin booked Wine Edventures and we had an awesome time! Shawn was a great tour guide/driver and took great care of us! The wineries were great and the box lunch was delicious. Thank you Shawn for a great day!,2
4,"One of my most favorite Indian restaurants. Nothing fancy but absolutely delicious meals.Never an issue being seated promptly. A casual dining experience awaits. Service is pleasant. Ambience a bit blahh but still enjoyable.Now onto the real reason to come here... the FOOD:Naan is soft. Garlic is tasty but I usually like the original best.  Regardless of your entree of choice, you really cannot go wrong. And although it does not appeal to my level of spiciness preferred (I like it HOT HOT HOT), it has great flavor and is great for the average spicey food eater. My recommendations are the Masala or Vindaloo (Chicken, Shrimp, Lamb... option is yours). Room for dessert? Order the Rice Pudding  and Gulab Jaman, mix together and enjoy the creamy sugary treat.",2
5,"There  aren't  enough  stars  to  review  The  Pearl ! Food , service  and  ambiance . I  enjoy  every  minute  of  every  visit ! Not  just  dinner , a genuine  dining  experience  ! Pamper  yourself !",2
1,Had a grilled chicken sandwich on bun to go. Couldn't hold sandwich due to bottom bun being soggy.  So I decided to just eat the meat.  I saw a piece of hair as I removed the meat. I haven't ate there in years and will not eat there again.  Zero stars from me.,0
5,Excellent place to get your nails done! I got a manicure and the guy did a fantastic job. Each nail is polished perfectly and time was taken to cover each tip so almost a week later they still look great! I will most definitely be back!,2
5,"Ok all I can say is wow, the service here was above and beyond what I had expected , first of all got here to be greeted by valet which they took my junk car :) and the bell boy took all out baggage which was all over the place with plastic bags and all, so I walked in with my wife to the front desk to check in, once we got our keys we went up to our room and had a free upgrade to have a jacuzzi in our room ... Yeaaa, the food at most of the restaurants were not so great but the high class ones were defiantly good but expensive. I can't complain because I bought a $50 coupon to have to nights there with $100 of eating and $25 of arcade gaming which in and my wife really enjoyed, so hey I got a $500 deal for $50 that's why I was satisfied , but besides that I think staying here and eating is pretty expensive and probably wouldn't pay full price ....",2
5,Had a really good time here. The staff was quick and friendly. We had the breakfast buffet which was really good and had a great selection. Definitely will be a place I recommend to my friends.,2
3,"On Black Friday a few friends always get together; share food(usually leftovers) drink, jam, and whatever. After taking a walk in nearby Pennypack Park(including checking out the King's Highway Bridge), we found ourselves in Holmesburg. As it was too late to order from Jack's Place(as we usually do), & I remember bookmarking this place.We ordered a large pizza w/ grilled veg. a veggie wrap, + an order of hand-cut fries. The pizza was very good. The veggies were onions, sweet & bell peppers, broccoli and mushrooms. They were briefly sauteed on a flat-top, so I guess that technically was grilled.They were mostly in the center of the pie however. The crust was good, as was the sauce, and ample amounts of cheese made for an above average pizza. Too bad it was cold by the time we got it home, which was only a five minute drive. So were the fries. They were tasty, not overly salted nor greasy. You get a huge amount per order ($5), but were pretty much soggy because of the huge amount piled together. The garlic parm aoili was O.K., could have used more garlic.You can get these fries as poutine, or w/ other toppings for an additional $1-4.The veggie wrap was standard, but decent. All this food was just over $30, which seemed a tad high.An OK augmentation to our leftovers; I say this place has better than average pizza & fries, but is not so special as to want to return soon, or to try other stuff they serve. Definitely Jack's Place next time.",1
2,"Just ok. This restaurant was attached to our hotel. Bread pudding was burnt on top and all of the yummy sauce dripped off before it was served.The ""bacon onion pizza"" (I cant pronounce the actual name, but we felt ""flamin cootchie"" was a possibility)was supposed to be awesome, but I felt the torte was soggy. The beet salad was great. Shrimp étouffée  had a good sauce, but small portion. As mentioned in other reviews, expect to spend some time there because the waitstaff is very nice, but slow.All in all, there are better places to eat in NOLA.",0
5,Good place. Good people and fair pricing. They got the job done on time and for less than they estimated.,2
1,"Truly a trash company..prices rise every year due to gas prices..even though gas was cheaper than previous year. Been using for 8 years and I am ""Done""..believe the reviews...environmental(gas) fee is now over $120/year on top of the $450/ for residential trash pick up...Ripoff!!..i hope we have another option in Oracle Az.",0
5,"The staff is so so sweet and friendly and really makes this place as fantastic as it is. The coffee is great, and their amazing grilled cheese and baked goods make for a great afternoon bite. They have a good selection of tea and a great atmosphere -- also try their pizza place Capo Fitto in old city if you want a fabulous dinner",2
5,"My god is this place ever wonderful! Such a huge selection delicious teas! The sales people are also very friendly, and it seems they really enjoy their job. They will literally let you smell absolutely every tea. My favourites are Chocolate Rocket, Swampwater, Tropicalia, and Goji Pop. You can buy tins of loose tea, and these will generally last you a long while. They also carry wonderful tea accessories, teacups, teapots, mesh balls, natural sweeteners, infusers, the works. Definitely try DavidsTea, you won't regret it!",2
5,"We did the Cemetery tour with Michael, he did an excellent job keeping us excited and informed.  His passion for the city is contagious and his speech in front of the Plessy tomb was the highlight of the tour.We took a second tour (Haunted 5 in 1) with Brian.  He was awesome, super energetic and told us some amazing ghost stories at the Andrew Jackson hotel.",2
4,"This was my first visit to 3 Sisters Cafe and I was not disappointed. I had just come out of a physical therapy appointment for my spouse down the road at Athletico and wanted a tasty, fast breakfast -- with FAST being the operative word here. I took a chance on 3 Sisters and it really paid off. We were in and out of there with great service in about 35 minutes total. It's a small place with friendly servers. I had a classic breakfast: 2 eggs, toast, and bacon. This was called ""The Don"" and came with potatoes but they swapped the taters for bacon at no additional cost. What an unexpected surprise! Everything was cooked to perfection: eggs over medium, wheat toast perfectly toasted, and crispy bacon. My husband ordered a ""half"" order of pancakes which was a single giant pancake that took up literally the entire platter. He also had a side order of eggs. The portions were so generous that he wasn't able to finish it all despite having just worked up an appetite from the physical therapy. The only thing I wish I could change is the acoustics in the place. I love that it's a converted old cottage house, but the echoes of nearby diners is pretty disruptive. There were only 4 groups of people counting us and it was pretty loud. We considered moving to their nice outdoor dining area but it's 85 and humid so we stayed put. I'll definitely be back with friends!",2
4,"First time back to Nashville since I was in high school, and can't believe I haven't been back sooner! Here at Vanderbilt for a class, and kept passing by the Tavern on my way to campus each morning... Had an inticing, rustic, downtown Manhattan look to it. So I put it on my list of places to check out. I looked here in Yelp, and saw it had great reviews. I came in for dinner tonight, and immediately noticed the reclaimed wood door, wrought iron, and alternative rock playing. I knew it would be a great place. I sat at the bar, as I was here by myself, and immediately got a menu and was offered a drink. I had the 1920, which was a little stout, but better than weak, am I right? I ordered the lamb tacos, Tennessee tavern fries, and cinnamon roll bread pudding. Tacos were small, but honestly a decent portion considering how much meat was on them. They were hot out of the kitchen, and the roasted peanuts gave it great crunch. Now, the Tennessee tavern fries ... Sweet potato fries with a touch of cinnamon and sugar, with jalapeño ketchup. Shut the front door, these were to die for. Light and airy, arrived in a mini frying basket with abundant portions. The ketchup was amazing, and I definitely asked for more. The cinnamon roll bread  pudding was a muffin size portion, with vanilla ice cream, homemade whip, and caramel sauce. Great flavor, not overwhelming. Service was fantastic, and even met some fun people! Highly recommend this place. I'll be coming back for sure.",2
4,"If you are looking for a small quaint place to have a good plate of Pho as you come in from the cold in Avon then this is the place!! I was introduced to Pho 36 by my co-workers after I first arrived to the area and have got to say that I will be coming back.The portions are generous for the cost, and the service was excellent.  The waitress was friendly and was very quick to ask if we wanted anything else.  She would continually come back and check in on us.I got their Chicken Pho and it was really good.  Everyone in our party was very satisfied with their choices and we did not leave hungry.  I can't wait to come back and bring my family.",2
5,After driving but his place many times I figured me and the wife should check it out. It was absolutely amazing!!!The outside patio area is wonderful. The inside has many seats as well. So many beer selections ON TAP as well as mixed drinks. We looked over there menu and ordered a few appetizers which where great. The service was also great. I must say from the outside I really did not expect this restaurant/bar to be good. I was taken away and would recommend this establishment to anyone/everyone. A+++,2
2,"CHECK YOUR BILL!  The service was just ok and so was the food.  The big issue I had is when the check was delivered there was an ""ACA Surcharge?""   In case you were wondering what this is, as I did, it's a surcharge the restaurant is sneaking onto the check to cover their expenses for the Affordable Care Act, i.e., Obamacare!  Sorry, but I pay almost $400 a month for health insurance already for me and my child and I don't want to pay for others.  I did request to take it off which took an additional 30 minutes!  The manager did come to the table and told us the servers are required to tell us upon seating about the surcharge and that its posted on their menus.  We were not warned ahead of time and when I asked to see the menu the manager just said he'd take it off the check.  We will not be returning.  The only reason I am giving two stars is the server seemed like a good person and when the food is done right it can be tasty, but there never seems to be any consistency to either.",0
1,"My review is primarily about delivery and customer service.  Delivery.I have attempted (by myself and with friends/family) to have Reginelli's delivered to my house on four separate occasions in the last year.  The first time it came within the stated time frame and was ok, so we continued to order.  The last three times I've ordered Reginelli's they always say that delivery will be about 45 minutes (thats ok) but when the hour mark occurs I usually give them a call to ask as to the status of my order.  They always say, ""We're sorry, we suddenly got really busy, its on its way.""  (This wasn't on a weekend, holiday or Mardi Gras, so go figure about the sudden rush)...My pizza finally arrived somewhere around the 2 hr mark and was stone cold (all three times).  The first time I called them back to complain and the lady on the phone basically said, ""We're sorry, we'll replace it but it will be at least hour and a half before we get it to you.""   The last two times, I didn't even bother to call.  If a pizza delivery comes late once, thats understandable, it does happen, but when it happens three times with the same company then its time to call someone else.",0
5,"The food here is above average and the service is fantastic!The owner, Teddy, and his wife are personable, nice, and amazing with names.  We have eaten in and had food delivered more times than I can count.  It is great to have a Chinese restaurant like this in our area as we have all been to ""not so great"" places that can just make your stomach turn.Shanghai Express is and overall great experience and I would recommend to all!",2
4,"We have come here many times, this time we came in around 1pm & the place was packed. I think they were a little under staffed. There was no hostess when we got there because she was to busy cleaning. Olivia was our server & had just transferred from another store but did pretty good. We had mozz sticks, boneless (all you can eat) special & a margarita. All was ok,     We have never really experienced a problem here & it is close to home.",2
2,"The reviews seemed promising, maybe they had an off night, but the food here was not good. We were a small group of 3 and tried a handful of dishes: pulled pork sliders, mac and cheese, cheddar and chorizo fries, BBQ duck wings, aside from the BBQ duck wings everything was just not god, mac and cheese was watery and lacked flavor, fries were boring, sliders were just ok. With so many other restaurants popping up in this area I doubt I""ll go back and give it a second chance. I can't say much about the drinks, I think my sister was happy with the manhattan she ordered. I got a whiskey sour, I know not very adventurous, but didn't finish it, after you've tasted a well made whiskey sour, its hard to drink any others.",0
3,Late night bar in old city is a must for house tequila shots and karaoke.  Great for large groups to pound light beers to last call.  You be hard to find a sober person pass midnight which means this bar is a must to stop by before you hit the bed.  Made even find someone to join you for the night.  No short request for Garth Brooks or 80's song during karaoke.  You don't have to participate to the wonderful sounds of Philly.,1
4,"Delicious sandwiches, great pizzas, decent sides, all made with fresh, flavorful ingredients. Their toasted subs are the best, and the pizza sauce is among the best around. Really, my only complaint is the lack of a whole grain bread. Try the traditional grinder, or the tuna sandwich.",2
4,"It's so nice to have another 24 hour diner right in my back yard and I have few complaints.  The food is diner quality, not question about it, so I'm not going to expect amazing things in that regard.  Frozen and pre-processed?  Yep, it's there.  Do I care?  Nope.  I'm here for standard American diner fare.What I'm really wowed with is the deserts and coffee.  Finally a diner in Delco that has good quality coffee, not Starbuck's good, but definetly Wawa good.  The pie and cake are out of this world!  Coconut custard and carrot cake are by far my favorite, I'm a picky foodie when it comes to deserts (having made my own out of Cooks Illustrated) and I can confidently say this is some good pie.Another bonus they have over Tom Jones is that they take a credit card.",2
4,"Went here with my husband and another couple Saturday night.  Not very busy when we walked in, but picked up shortly after.  Apparently you are not supposed to park across the street but we got away with it.  This place is cash only, and even though they've been featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives, there's nothing inside to suggest that Guy was ever here!  We wouldn't have gone if not for that fact (wouldn't know it existed) so maybe they should at least put up a picture of him that was taken when he visited!  They let you sample, but have a sign that tells you, ""Please know when to stop"". I wish I'd read the reviews here first, because I would've gotten a 6-for-$6 sampler!!!  They were all good flavors, there are some funky ones, for sure!  I ended up with Coffee Pecan Brittle, and everyone else got Red Velvet, except for my husband who got a scoop of Cookie Monster as well.  He thinks that he will be trying to conquer the Tchopitoulas Sundae next time we visit  (8 scoops of ice cream, 8 toppings, whipped cream, cherry) and I have no doubt he will get his name on the wall for finishing!The ice cream was very very rich and thick, and super delicious.  Would definitely recommend if you're in the area, but a little out of the way if you want to stay in the French Quarter (car required!)",2
2,"This is my fourth visit.   It's much improved from our first visit but still not yummy.  The brisket, while not petrified, was still dry and chewy.  I'm not sure whether the bun was stale or just not to my liking.  It was kinda dry too but that might be the way its supposed to be.  I liked the mashed potato side.  Fairly garlicky.   Coleslaw too saucy for me but not bad. In general, I love brisket on a bun....but here it's .....passable.  Not something to make a point of coming out for.",0
4,"Hidden gem !! Starting with my extra foam cappuccino , paired nicely with my Warm Poached Black Mission Figs, and finishing with my perfectly toasted Prosciutto Cotto Sandwich!!! Perfect crunch on every bite ! Would've given them a 5 star rating but the service was okay .Other than that highly recommend",2
5,This was our first breakfast stop on our trip to New Orleans. It was great! Being gluten free and vegetarian the Migas was awesome. Maybe the potatoes were too spicy but besides that everything was so good. Try the cheesy grits. Love the decor too.,2
3,"I have been a loyal customer at Magasin Cafe for years, it's what made me fall in love with Vietnamese food. Since Magasin Cafe has closerd for renovations I came to Magasin Kitcheb to curb my weekly pho cravings. The food and service were good- even the chopped was seasoned better than the other location. However, paying more money for the same meal and the restaurants atmosphere deters the ranking. Quality food and service will continue to keep me a loyal customer.",1
5,This is the best taco shop ever! The birria is very flavorful and you must try the homemade horchata! The rice is tasty and beans are very creamy.  Every now and then they also have rice pudding and it is top notch!  I go to this little hidden in the wall place every chance I get!,2
5,"Five stars for the mascarpone polenta, the curry ketchup for the sweet potato fries, and the mango curry brie skillet.Has an Atkins option. Meat cooked perfectly. Lots of selection. This place is dope!",2
1,"This is the worst Chik-fil-A I have ever been to. On multiple occasions I have waited over 25 minutes to get my food. Their response is ""Sorry, we got backed up."" It seems they are backed up on every occasion. They even have the sandwiches pre-made waiting to go in the bags but somehow, among all 10 employees behind the counter, they are so backed up that a five minute wait turns to a 25 plus minute wait. Avoid at all cost. Much better options at the Union!",0
2,"I've been to several different Cracker Barrels over the years and usually love them, but this one was really disappointing. The food was poorly cooked (unmashed mashed potatoes, flat biscuits) and it came to the table cold. The waitress wasn't very nice or helpful either. The store was cute (as always) and the people working in it were great, but we didn't go there for the store. I'll probably be avoiding this location in the future.",0
4,We went in early June with a group of 11 for an early dinner. The service was excellent. The server was able to guide us as to the best dishes that would fit our taste.We had the grilled shrimp - very tasty with garlic and olive oil. The black paella was delicious - no fishy taste even though it used squid ink. The portion size she said we would get was not as large as she made it sound so if you are a crowd get two.The battered and fried garlic was amazing - meltingly tender pieces of mellow garlic.The pork belly was amazing - slightly crisp exterior and yet soft and supple with a rich flavor.The beef tenderloin with port sauce (?) was very flavorful and best ordered in multiples it is so delicious.The fried cauliflower was not greasy and had well developed brown notes. The Pudin con caramelo for dessert was terrific with a rich caramel sauce. Hot and crusty on the outer edges but a tad cool in the center. Have them cut it in half before they warm it so it is warm throughout.The regular sangria was fruity and a good value ordered in a pitcher.,2
1,This place insults Chinese cuisine much like Olive Garden does to Italian. I'll shank someone w/ chopsticks if they ever suggested this dump.,0
1,"I ordered the Chicken Carbonara and after getting halfway through my dish, I realized it did not have any ""chicken""???  Instead if apologizing and helping me, both waiters told me the chef had been here for ""30years""???  Does that mean a mistake can't be made?  I did not agree with the lack of empathy nor did I welcome their tone!You guys need to improve and make sure that you treat your customers with more care.....I am visiting from Los Angeles, CA and I will surely NOT recommend this business.Respectfully,James",0
5,Come here for hot August nights every year and have a great time. Rooms are clean and Newly remodeled. Having the lake behind it is great for taking a little stroll,2
5,"This was my first time here. Drawn in by a ""free original cheesy"" sandwich. The grilled cheese was terrific. The tomato - basil soup was very good, as were the waffle fries. The menu choices are intriguing, so I'll be back!!!",2
5,"I wrecked my car working for a delivery company; the front of it was absolutely smashed. My boss told me to take it to Ironhorse, even though I was pretty sure it was totaled at the time....so much for what I know...The guys at Ironhorse took care of everything and now my car looks brand new. Craig was extremely friendly and gave me weekly progress updates. He even gave my a ride home so that I wouldn't have to take the bus! These guys are awesome! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",2
1,"This place gets one star they need to replace the whole staff me and my friends have labeled this place as super ghetto, some servers are nice I guess but there's no structure, management doesn't know how to compensate for horrible service, I've been to other applebees and it was not like this, I would suggest new management. And If you're looking for even a little bit of class don't come here.",0
5,"This is sort of our secret place for lunch. It has great food, decent prices and the staff is friendly. It's a bit quiet when you walk in, but don't let that throw you off, the food is amazing. :)",2
4,The service is always on point and the coffee is the best.  Not to mention the great snacks and sandwhiches.  They put alot of hard work and time into making this place a great neighborhood spot.,2
5,"My go to ramen place in town! You'd think you were ordering ramen on the street in Korea or Japan! It's that good. Try to get there before 2 to get a seat reservation. Tends to fill up fast, due to it being in Sam Hughes area and close to the UofA. Worth going and trying then all. Chopsticks use are recommended otherwise you'll get stares for using a fork or spoon here!",2
1,"I had good expectations.Walked in this afternoon after trying to drop my bass off next door, but the music store wasn't open yet.  Decided to try Mudbugs since I've been putting it off for some time now.  As I approached the counter, the man behind it asked if there was a machine gun in my case.  Really?  It's a guitar, have you never seen a guitar case before?  I asked if he wanted to bet on it. Idiot.Despite the ignorance, I went ahead and ordered.  I had read that the crawfish casserole was award winning, so it was an easy choice.  I placed my order and had a seat.The food arrived quickly, and I made my first observation.  The casserole was more like a risotto, which I thought was a fun play on the word.  Unfortunately, the rice was insanely overcooked, the texture literally made me dry heave.  I'm sure had it have been prepared correctly it would have been good, but it wasn't and it was terrible.  I can't think of anything off the top of my head that I've eaten recently that was that bad.  I understand people mess up, but don't serve the overcooked and disgusting product.  I'll never be back, what came out on my plate was unacceptable.  Highly recommend trying anywhere else.",0
5,"Checked in on a beautiful Thursday morning for my honey's birthday.  Had a masseuse come up for her gift massage while I sat out on the parapet reading, next to a hummingbird nest in the adjacent tree (two eggs the size of Tic Tacs). Then we went out for First Thursday Art Crawl (way too many people) and dinner. Back to the Eagle, where we turned on the fire and got into the hot tub.  Very quiet and pretty room, great ambiance, enjoyed breakfast in bed the next morning. Finished our visit by taking two of their bikes on a ride along the beach before the crowds descended.",2
1,"Last night I paid cover and bought two overpriced drinks and then went out dancing. It was so hot and stuffy that I got really thirsty. They refused to give me water! They said I had to buy a bottle for $2. I tried to reason with them, but they were pretty rude. I have never heard of a bar not giving someone water when requested. Bartender said that 7-11 did not have to give me water either ????? So weird, and such a bad policy considering how much I had already spent there and how hot it was. I will never go back. I refuse to spend another dollar there on principle. I ended up leaving, getting a cup of water from my car and walking back in with it.After that I was mad at them, but trying to have fun for my friends' sake. Still I told the Rue 13 photographer that I did not want to be in their promotional photos, but they took pictures of me anyway.Finally, my tights ripped because they snagged on splinters when I walked by their stage area.Cheap quality, overpriced, bad service. Do not recommend!",0
2,"When this place first opened we went. We loved the Greek salad and gyros. It was very fresh tasting and the place was cute. We went back last night- the tables were all dirty, lamps full of dirt and dead bugs- so that was a turn off. We got our food and the quality has gone way down. My salad had one bite of potato salad and two items in the salad - tomato and pepper tasted off. I had to spit them out. My daughter got a fajita bowl with chicken. Her tomato was also gross and the chicken was cooked into charred rubber. We ordered baklava and it was stale. I hope they clean and go back to the quality it was when they first opened. It was yummy and clean.",0
5,"I have enjoyed this spot for several years and it has always been 5 star. The staff is always friendly and the sushi always fresh. It is small and quaint,  a nice get away.",2
1,"The hotel was really nice but the service we had downstairs in the bar was ridiculous.  The tables were so dirty. I asked the bartender (Kaitlin) if they could wipe it down and she handed me a wet paper towel.  Which okay, that's fine, not a big deal. We ordered our food and she just kinda dropped everything off on one end of the table and then left.  The only waitress/bartender who ever came by to ask if we were okay was Lindsay.  It seemed like they thought they were too good to offer good service. Oh, yea, and Zoey was rude enough that I complained to the manager of the hotel.  I would never come back here and I would def tell my friends not to either.  Oh, and don't try to use your Straz tickets for the free appetizer like they advertise if you want your ticket back.  My husband had to get into an argument with Kaitlin so I could get my ticket back even though we were told we'd get them back. You'd probably get better service at your local dive bar but at least you won't be paying $12 for a cocktail.",0
5,This place overall probably one of the best chill spots ever the bartenders are very personable. They remember their regulars. :) always have some random movie on thats always a nice ice breaker to talk to people huge selection of beers! What more do u want??,2
5,"The cauliflower pizza is the BEST. We will be back again & again to get some pre made protein packs  and look around for more healthy and delish goodies. Loved the cauliflower sandwich too, Great place!",2
4,"Fresh grouper is amazing here. Prepared anyway you want it.  Family tried 5 different meals and they were all great. Came on a Sunday night and the wait time was awful, took at least an hour to get a table. But it was the day before Memorial Day.  Would definitely come back again though.",2
5,Amazing sushi! Lunch prices are great. Endless sushi and hibachi!,2
5,best coffee shop in santa barbaragreat vegan snacksvery nice and beautiful employeesalso good music,2
5,"Excellent italian food at good prices.  On weekends you need a reservation.  It is small, the tables are close to one another, and it is loud.  I can understand how it could bug people, and if the food wasn't so good, it would bug me.  Overall though, the crowd, noise, size, only add to the experience of being at a popular restaurant with good food.",2
3,"I was looking for a restaurant in the city that offered a good steak at a reasonable cost.  I've been to the Capital Grill and I enjoy their beef as well as their service and decor, I just didn't want to spend $250.00 + for the 3 of us (call me cheap).  Not really knowing what to expect at the Marmont, we took a risk.  The Good:I have to say that the NY strip steaks and rib eye were very very good and cooked perfectly (medium rare and medium).  They were about 1-1/2 thick (forgot to bring my calipers) and well trimmed; very little fat was left. I would say the meat was prime, not choice.  We all enjoyed them as well as the fries which were cooked crisply as we requested.  the sauces were meh; why cover up the wonderful taste of the beef?  Service was good, prompt, and polite.   The Not So Good:The decor is awful.  The floor looks like painted OSB with the paint half worn off, the tables are painted plywood, lighting from K-Mart, and walls have a few giant old signs hanging on them.  The place is a visual dive. I felt like I was in a Tom Waits song.  How hard would it be to make it a nice warm and inviting space? I don't get it.   Want to make more money? Spend the 5K, it will pay off. But please find someone who knows what they are doing.  You serve delicious steaks; I'll bet your decorator doesn't do the cooking, so why ask the cook to decorate?If you want great steaks for a good price, go here.  But if you are looking for a classy or trendy setting too, you may need to pay the extra 30% at a high end steak house.",1
4,"The area that I grew up at had a town after town with small historical inns, B&Bs, and restaurants that served good comforting American food in a quaint rustic setting.  Some of the special ones in my memory seemed to reflect the love that the people running the place had for their small establishment.Hendel's is that special kind of place.When a coworker convinced me to eat there for lunch, I thought, ""Where the hell are you taking me?!"" as he turned off Lindbergh onto some seemingly random local roads.  I found myself in an area untouched by the familiar quazi-ghetto strip malls that I felt personified Florissant.Eating outside is a huge recommendation on the patio with the well tended garden and the overall cozy feel of the place.  The service is friendly and the food is very good, but nothing spectacular.  Regardless, if you're in the area, you should check this place out.  You'll definitely be going back again.",2
4,This was probably the most dive type bar we visited this past weekend for our girls trip in Nashville but I tend to like smaller bars so I really enjoyed my time! We stayed downstairs because 1. we wanted to hear the extremely talented band & 2. because upstairs felt about 20 degrees hotter. But overall the experience was very fun & relaxed.The only suggestion would be to go with a smaller group because it felt smaller than the other bars we had been visiting so it was hard to find a spot for all 9 of us.,2
5,"I went here with my wife, our toddler son, and a friend for dinner on a Monday.  The food was good and arrived fast.  The servers (Andrea and Tom) were friendly, professional, and 100% on top of everything.  Everyone was kind to our son and understood the quirks of a kid his age.  We were all made to feel very comfortable from start to finish.  We had brussels sprouts, fries, a burger with pork belly, some craft beers (good selection), and sandwiches.    I would absolutely go here again.",2
3,"Online ordering & prompt delivery! Great cheese bread! Average pizza, slightly underdone dough but tasty toppings. I prefer the pizza from Italia or steak and pizza.",1
4,This is a gem. My daughter found some pieces. I jus wish they had more for my size and age range. Worth a visit.,2
3,Went there for first time and had a buffet which for price is not bad considering the quantity of items served but quality wise it's not good at all in my opinion. I tried everything but really didn't like anything and specially I was eager to try the deserts kheer and gulab jamun and they were most terrible. I'm giving three starts because the manager was attentive and was doing his job very nice nicely. The restaurant is under renovation they are making it more appealing but in my opinion food quality and taste must be improved. Sorry for the bitter truth but writing this review in only hope that they improve. Good Luck!,1
5,Love coming to Deterdings!  Always feel part of the family.  It's a local legend.,2
2,"In addition to my previous review, my husband reminded me that the waiter leaned over him multiple times, dropping sweat onto my husband and the items in front of him on the table. GROSS!",0
5,"Great, local breakfast joint. Great diner feel, with tasty breakfast food including classics and classics with a twist! I got the steak and eggs and it did not disappoint. Plus, the shrimp and corn soup (their specialty) was really yummy, even for breakfast. Worth checking out if in the Old Jefferson hood.",2
5,This has quickly become one of my favorite places to eat! My friend and I have been here twice already and I've never left feeling disappointed. I recommend just about everything they have on the raw list and then on the medium plates the mama dumplings are a must! What also makes this place great in my book is that the service is amazing.,2
1,"SUPER DISAPPOINTED...recommended by a friend, came here to have a drink and an appetizer with my boyfriend, sat down at 5 o'clock at the bar and waited 25 minutes before we decided to get up and walk out. The bar was hardly full, 2 seats available as soon as we walked in and the restaurant itself was relatively empty. The bartender walked down and helped another couple but never acknowledged us. Hope others have a better experience because it is a good looking restaurant.",0
2,"Thouroughly disappointed by this one; I litterally starved myself up until 6pm to save every bit of room in my stomach for this night... I stopped at 5 different food trucks only to be met by sup par food and astronomical prices. My stops included SAMOSA DEB: $10 for Curry chicken with rice and Samosa - Horrible! Rice was overcooked to the point it was unrecognizable. It was mush. There was no curry. It taste more like a bland Indian dish which I have never had. The spices were there but there was no salt. The dosa was mushy. It was disgusting! Next stop K-TOWN KOREAN FRIED CHICKEN: $8 for 4 chicken wings supposedly cooked Korean Style. Save your time and your money and go straight to Cafe Soho! The wings were breaded and there was more breading than chicken. What a let down. Then on to THE COW AND THE CURD: $14 for gloriFRIED cheese and a frozen lemonade. It was a fancier version of a mozzarella stick. Sadly enough this is what I enjoyed the most. What left the bitter tast in my mouth from the visit to this truck? I was with friends from Atlanta who came to Philly for the Night Market so I wanted to share. I asked the OWNER for an extra dish to split the curds and his reply ""NO, WE HAVE NO EXTRA DISHES. TRY USING A NAPKIN.'' As I looked behind him to mounds of extra paper containers. Wow, way to loose a customer buddy. Now on to RELISH: $8 for Chicken In Waffles, yes people pieces of chicken were chopped up and  infused in the mini waffles, add a pat of maple syrup butter on top, yum yum. Sounds amazing right??? Yeah that's what I was thinking until I bit in to the waffle and my pallet was met by the DISGUSTING taste of DARK MEAT CHICKEN. My entire body quivered as I spit the waffle in to a napkin!  Come on RELISH, you should disclose this as not everyone has the stomach for dark meat...in the trash it went.I will not be returning to this Night Market! I saw the reviews but I really tried to give this one the benefit of the doubt. We were so disappointed we ended up driving to Jim's Steaks in West Philly to satisfy our food cravings. I will give the one in Chinatown a try in the Fall. My suggestions to my Foodies, avoid this one...",0
4,"I love Village Whiskey, it's just a shame it's always so crowded. The bar snacks and their signature burger are delicious. I'm bummed they did away with the warm pretzels, but oh well. The whiskey selection is extensive and the bar tenders are very helpful and knowledgeable. But be warned: their whiskeys by the glass are definitely a bit overpriced.",2
5,"This place is sadly perm closed. I was hoping not, however the phone is now disconnected.",2
3,The prices are a little high for ice cream that tastes about the same at the supermarket. I only got the cookie dough concrete and I will be sure to try something a bit more exotic next time to see if the ice cream is worth it's price tag.,1
1,"2 thumbs down. I Went there for my 1st ever  manicure. Another customer came in 20 minutes after I did, no appoint. either. She was there for gel manicure. 5 minutes later the girl sits us both down, then proceeds to start working on getting her set up with gel manicure. She was on her way back to me, and a lady comes in for an unscheduled eyebrow wax. She tells me it's going to be a few more minutes so she could wax her. So she was going to help 2 unscheduled women who came in after me. That's bad business. So I got up and left. They clearly don't need my business.",0
5,The best peach bread pudding on the planet! Everything that I've tried here has been beyond amazing...,2
1,"If I could select less than one star I would. Completely awful. After calling multiple times and no one answering, I finally was able to talk to a very unhelpful employee. He emailed me a specific unit, price, move in date and application. I filled out the paperwork but was unable to find the specific unit he indicated. When trying to call about my problem no one answered for 2 full business days. Then when talking with another very unhelpful employee, she told me that unit was already gone & suggested other units more expensive & not in the move in date discussed. When asking if they would honor the price originally discussed in email correspondence, they would not. Long story shorter, I cancelled my application & just wasted $50. This business only cares about money & does not care about the tenants at all.",0
5,"My dogs and i love this place!   Always try to go when they have sales going on.  They have a wide variety of toys and are pretty well stocked.  They even allow your pets to come in with you.  The staff is very caring and friendly.  Whenever I have a question about a certain product, they give me a great answer or find someone who knows more about it.  Even though it's a chain store, I feel like it's a nice neighborhood pet store.",2
2,Love the Greek salad. Pizza is above average. Service ranges from okay to worst on the face of the planet.,0
4,"It waa such a nice experience at the rare bird....clean,organized,friendly folks and very easy to walk thru... My only reason for not giving 5 stars is that it is certainly a collector's paradise, not a pickers....meaning kinda pricey,if you are looking for a deal...",2
5,"The food is awesome here. I went with some hardcore meat eaters and they absolutely loved it. They didn't even miss the meat and thought that if there was meat added to their dishes, the food probably will not be the same.",2
5,"Great restaurant! Awesome atmosphere incredible food! Cheese plate is a must. Their beet salad is so good, I had the sweet potatoe ravioli.... Sooo delicious!!! Their pastas are light and fresh and Full of flavor! Coming from an italian girl our standards are high for pasta! This place is almost as good and grandmas kitchen!  maybe better for ravioli but don't tell her that!  If you haven't been, you need to go! It's right in the gulch across from whiskey kitchen and adeles (2 other great nashville gems) I love this place, make a reservation, you won't be disappointed!",2
5,"Friday night staff was friendly.They have all your basics. Plus hotdogs, funnel cake, and churros.Price was right.",2
4,"Met some old friends for lunch and the pizza was great! We split 5 pies and had more than enough food for everyone. We split a Margherita pizza, sausage Sicilian slice, Salsiccia and a Crudo. The only thing I would have liked is if the Margherita had more basil. Each pie was very good and cooked perfectly in their wood oven. They had a very nice selection of beer and inside was small but comfortable.",2
4,"Just a head's up.  Arrive hungry.  You won't leave that way.  Their portions are huge, especially the pancakes, which my wife orders.  One is usually enough, just be sure to ask for a half stack).  We normally go for breakfast, although I have been for lunch.  Honey's has one of the best grits I've had out of all of the diners in Philly.  It tastes like it's cooked in cream instead of water.  The breakfast specials are definitely a hit as well as their basic breakfast items.  Homemade fresh orange juice is also a plus.  I usually go with the Honey's Cristo or Huevos Rancheros if I'm not feeling too adventerous for the specials.  Any egg items, grits, toast (the olive toast is nice and different from the norm) and a juice and you're on your way to a great start.  Also, make sure to get there early.  They don't take reservations and you can definitely expect to wait if you show up after 10am.  Went there one time for lunch and they had a fried pickle appetizer special that we tried.  It wasn't very good.  The breading was a bit too thick and the sauce wasn't very exciting.  But, definitely try the Reuben or Bubby's Brisket Sandwich.  Both are excellent choices.For me, breakfast is the way to go.",2
5,"The JW Marriott in downtown Indianapolis is absolutely beautiful with some of the best views of the city. The hotel has anything you could ask for from restaurants to the High Velocity Sports Bar to Starbucks. A few friends and I stayed here for a Bachelorette Party and its location in the city made it easy to walk to and from dinner without having to go outside in the snowy weather we had and is pretty centrally located. Although the room was not quite ready at 3:00PM when we checked and there was no fridge in the room, these were minor things compared to the excellence of this hotel. The staff was extremely helpful and made sure to assist their guests with any inquiries. The rooms were beautiful with comfortable beds and large bathrooms. I would definitely recommend this hotel not only for its amazing view of Indy, but for the excellent service they offer to all of their guests.",2
1,"Service is horrible. The staff pop there head in and leave. No one to take an order. Came about 45 min early to make sure to order food. The front desk said to go in and there will be people to come take my order. But they just popped there head in and left. I was sitting front center ,so you couldn't miss me. Probably last time I'm coming here.",0
5,"Pucketts is really a great Southern restaurant. You'll get friendly service and so many great food and drink options. My personal favorite meal, so far, is the Smoked Meatloaf. This is not anything like Mama's meatloaf. It is a combo of their brisket and pulled pork. I love that the topping is not too sweet. It's so good... makes it difficult to try other dishes. But, you may also want to try a burger with the pimento cheese....Yum! They have great seasonal cocktails, and my current favorite is the Honey, I'm Home. It tastes like the perfect light summer drink. Their weekend live music is always great as well! Great food, great people!",2
4,"Nice atmosphere and love that they serve food, gourmet food in fact! The beers were good but not my favorite. Was a bit disappointed that the sampler sizes were so $$ compared to just getting a full glass.",2
3,"Mediocre food but great location and friendly service. Looks more legit than it actually was, maybe on par with Sonnys.",1
5,"I'll admit I messed up and tried to rent a car from another enterprise location and they didn't have a compact car ready for but they gave me an SUV for a discounted rate with no hesitation. Then a few days later when I found out my car would take a week to be done I called to get a compact car due to money issues and they told me to keep the SUV for the compact car rate! Can't beat that! This enterprise location is so nice, quick, and accommodating. When I'm in need of a rental it's the only place I'll go!",2
5,"Okay, first review, and I don't even live in Philly anymore. But now in Houston, I'm feeling the loss. I'd say there are two categories of doctorliness which make this a 5-star review. First, the impersonal stuff. Modern office, computerized charting, accurate scheduling (I was never kept waiting), the ability to make an appointment at short notice to get something looked at, convenient location. Can't think of anything that's lacking. She shares her office with another doctor who I haven't met.The second category is the personal aspect. When I showed up the first time as a new patient, she spent a good deal of time with me and I got the feeling she cared about me as a person. Sweet. In all subsequent visits, that never changed. Without going into medical details, she herself called me when the results came in for some minor (and false) tests. All in all, I can't imagine a better doctor. Why is it I found a badass doctor and a badass dentist in the one place I didn't live for any length of time?",2
5,Excellent brews! Nice area provided to enjoy the product.,2
5,"On a recent trip to New Orleans I realized I left my dress shirt at home. My suit wouldn't have looked good with the one clean Roots Canada T-shirt I had left, so I headed off to Perlis to find myself a white button-down for dinner at Commander's Palace.Perlis was everything a proper men's clothing store should be. A gentleman in an impeccable suit helped me find the perfect French cuff American-made shirt. When I mentioned my dilemma, he had their in-house seamstress steam and press the shirt for me at no charge.Helping me find the perfect shirt would be enough reason to go back, but going above and beyond to really save the day makes me want to wax poetic about this place.",2
4,"Really great made to order pizza, like a Chipotle for pizza! I had the alligator sausage with pepperoni, onions, mushrooms and jalapeños on mine and it was delicious! Great beer and smores pie too (use the Yelp offer for the smores pie)! Some issues with charging for this free pie but otherwise great service too!",2
4,"The food lacked flavor, but everything else was great. The presentation is near perfect and the location/decor are spot on.",2
3,"chicken sandwich was a little light on the jam and spinach, good portion of chicken.  Roll was great.  But really, .50 for a little side of mayo when 7 of us are ordering sandwiches and drinks?",1
1,"Being a female I've never had to deal with tux shops until I/we started planning our wedding but you always hear the 'horror' stories of tuxes not fitting, pieces missing, pieces being dirty, stained, or damaged, somebody being charged for something, etc., so I was hoping we were one of the lucky ones that came out on the other side unscathed.  The planning process wasn't a grueling experience at all.  With 10 additional men in the wedding spanning 3 different states, it was extremely convenient for everybody to handle their tux at whatever location was most convenient for them.  Having any one of the other 10 tuxes be compromised in any way (wrong fit, dirty, damaged, missing pieces, etc.) would be an inconvenience and obviously not ideal for a wedding that you pay huge bucks for everything to be perfect.  During the 2 months leading up to the wedding all 11 men went in and got fitted on time with only a few of them needing alterations or different sizes, my husband's being one of them (just one piece of the tux was wrong).  The rest of the guys picked theirs up with no problem, which left them to screw up the one tux that actually mattered most.  When my husband went in the day before the wedding to pick up his tux they couldn't give it to him because they didn't have it.  With only one piece of the tux needing to be replaced earlier in the week, they somehow managed to lose or send out the whole tux.  My husband mentioned that they weren't even very apologetic about it, just that that was that and they'd overnight the tux so that it was to them by the morning.  Our wedding was a couple hours away so my husband had to miss out on a couple things with some of our family and friends because he had to wait at home to pick up his tux the morning of our wedding and then drive all the way to the where our wedding in time for the photographer, etc.  Fast forward a couple weeks and we get a card in the mail ""Congratulations on your wedding.  I personally would like to thank you for choosing Men's Wearhouse for your special day.  From all of us here, good luck and congratulations!"" - ""Jason"".  I instantly take notice to 2 very obvious things....  1-) Where's the apology? And 2-) The 12 year old chicken scratch that wrote the card was not Jason, the person who signed it.  Different print, different color ink.  ""I PERSONALLY would like to thank you...."" ....not so personal anymore is it?Somewhat of a slap in the face that they didn't somehow take note to their screw up and at least follow up with us via a phone call to make sure everything went well and to offer an apology.  Also a slap in the face that Jason Hartley, an ""Operations Manager"", couldn't even write a card himself, given the circumstances.  To say I'm annoyed by this, would be an understatement.  I WILL say, however, that Jason is lucky my husband didn't tell me about all of this until after the tux was in hand and en route to the wedding (and on time) the morning of our wedding because otherwise, he wouldn't have gotten off so easily.",0
1,Did not like this hotel at all. Me and my husband stayed there one night after getting off our honeymoon cruise out of New Orleans. While still on the boat I called the hotel to let them know that we would only be staying one of the two nights we reserved due to some issues with our home in Houston. We had to leave early to address them in person. I communicated that with the manager who stated that he would call me back because he was dealing with another customer. Never received a callback. We checked in Saturday March 5 at 1600. We left the next day Sunday March 6 at 1130. As we checked out I told the manager it was an early checkout and he said that I would have to talk to the third party vendor (booking.com) to not be charged. I was okay with that. Fast forward to today. Called booking.com and the customer associate stated that the manager charged me for the second night that I never used as a penalty for not warning them of our ealy check out. He lied. I spoke to him at least twice about us leaving. DO NOT STAY HERE IF YOU ARE OUT OF TOWN. VERY UNCLEAN AND DISGUSTING and the management is sketchy. Take your money and go somewhere nicer.,0
4,"Cool and Very interesting Hotel. It looks new and has Lots of parking and has places to eat inside. Its a little closer to Downtown Reno than Atlantis but still a car ride away. ONLY problem i have is, the decor is very Disorienting  and at times gave me a headache! ( its really bright and just too many lights)",2
2,"Great food, awful service. I ordered online at 6:20, site said it would be ready at 6:40. I get there at 6:37 and i expected to wait a couple minutes but not the entire 20 minutes it takes to cook my food. They didn't even start cooking it till i got there. I leave at 7. They did nothing for the inconvenience and still made me pay full. Honestly, I'm so upset with how the whole situation was handled. Where is the customer service??",0
4,"I've been on a road trip for the past month, and had to get my Subaru Forester repaired several times along the way. Keith's has been the most helpful mechanic I have experienced so far! The waiting room was comfortable and accommodating, the employee I worked with (Jason) was very friendly and helpful. I didn't feel as though I was being pressured into anything.",2
5,"My husband and I stayed in Germantown section of Nashville and ate breakfast both days during our stay....the staff, the food, the attention to detail was TOP NOTCH!!!! We sat At the little bar they have and enjoyed watching the hustle bustle of the staff who showed true southern hospitality to each other and the patrons!!! I highly recommend the butter pecan pancakes!! NO frozen home fries here!! Amazing smooth French roast coffee....Loved this place!!",2

5,"I guess it is an old habit from when I was still active duty and had the need for a haircut every week, but one of the first things I like to do in a new town is find a good barbershop. So, I went with the reviews on Yelp and tried The Men's Room. This is it, great haircut, cool dudes, clean, a free drink and massage, The Men's Room has made it to the top of the list! There is more than one reason so many people have given them 5 stars.",2

Check it out - I'm wearing my sunnies in my car and it's just after seeing Alyssa! :) As for the rest of the team, everyone is super nice, talented and helpful!",2
1,"I'd like to update my review from a few years back. My how things can change. This place is now a 1-star joke. The food has gone downhill at all the restaurants. The 10 dollar parking is ridiculous (thankfully I'm an elite player so woohoo free parking) but my biggest gripe now is this ""bounce back"" play is AWFUL!! How can you truly expect someone who goes through $1000  in 2 days time to be happy with a measly $30 in free play. I plan on taking my mom to Fresh Harvest for her birthday and after that, you will NOT see me anymore. I'd rather drive to Immokalee or to the East Coast",0

1,"I've been here a handful of times, and bagels have always been delicious. I visited the shop on 5/19/18, and this will be my last visit. I went there because I was hungry and in need of food, but it seemed like I walked into the middle of classic P.T. Barnum show: clowns juggling while riding unicycles and elephants parading around on their hind legs. The first employee I interacted with, at the ""bulk"" bagel counter, didn't hesitate to let me know that I was attempting to order from the wrong location. Fair enough. They did have a sign on the counter, but it wasn't as conspicuous as an ""order here"" sign that dangles from the ceiling. Her tone made it clear to me that I had already committed one transgression. I then order from the attendant at the POS. I clarified my complicated order of a breakfast sandwich and two toasted everything bagels with a tomato and garlic cream cheese, three times. The first clarification was that I wanted everything bagels, not plain. The second  clarification was directed toward me because they actually have garlic and herb cream cheese, not garlic cream cheese. The third was my reiteration of the tomato and the quantity of the said bagels. At this point I had more confidence in a drunk ESL Uber driver getting me home safely than my order being prepared as per my request. After waiting for my extravagant order to be prepared to imperfection and gazing at the yellow ceiling grid with stalactites of black dust, my name was called and the first employee I interacted with hastily handed me my bagel bag. On the ride home I asked my partner in crime to ensure that there were 3 bagels in the bag because they probably ""F-ed"" the order up. He assured me that the quantity was correct. When I got home, I feverishly ripped open the wrapping on the two everything bagels, like a joyous child on Christmas Day, only to find     that the bagels had the tomatoes omitted and the cream cheese barely exceeded a skim coat. The breakfast sandwich was anemic at best with barely any protein on it. I am so glad that I expected disappointment. Honestly I'm not too upset because closer to my house there is a new bagel shop: Red House bagels, where the staff is courteous, the shop is cleaner, and the bagels a bit larger. Red House is my new bagel stop.  Sorry Newtown Bagel Co, you've been replaced. Although your actual bagels are slightly better tasting, it is not enough to reconcile the pain points associated with your operations. My words of advice, replace (don't clean) your ceiling tiles and clean the filth from the grid. Having almost 10 years of food and beverage experience, I would hate to see what your walk-in and floors behind the counter look like. Coach your employees on courteous service, or maybe treat them better and they might pass that on to your patrons. Oh and maybe write the orders down before entering them into the POS, because sometimes those machines aren't as navigable for some operators. I'd like to keep going on about this, but I am probably beating an already abused P.T. Barnum animal.",0
4,"Went here for lunch on a Friday. I got the fried chicken tenders (hot) with the collard greens and macaroni and cheese. All three were really good! It was more than enough for a meal but could have been split in two. The chicken was juicy and well cooked, but if you like spicy food you will need to add more hot sauce. The sides were also well made. I was interested in trying the bourbon whipped sweet potato but I'm glad I didn't. A friend had ordered it but didn't finish it because she said it wasn't good. I tried a bit of it and completely agreed. Idk if it was the bourbon or lack of seasoning but it just was not good. I usually will make plain sweet potatoes at home, boiled or baked, with a little salt and pepper and they have more flavor then this dish had. Other than that, what I enjoyed my meal. I would be interested in trying other options. It was great for a quick lunch, even with a long line we ordered and got our food pretty quickly. The staff was also really friendly.",2
4,"Lovely boutique hotel!  Room was pleasant - a little small but certainly enough space for 2 good friends. Very convenient to almost anywhere in the city.  Good relationships with neighboring businesses such as restaurants, gyms and parking facilities. Had a reunion weekend with a college roommate, and neither of us are familiar with Philly.  Shawna, the concierge/receptionist, is fantastic!  Her restaurant recommendations were excellent, her customer service skills greatly appreciated, and her invitation to return and contact her directly for help with arrangements seemed 100% sincere. We felt like we made a friend who would remember us at a return visit. She is an asset to this business. Hoping to return with a larger group, as Philadelphia is somewhat of a mid-point geographically. We will certainly consider The Independent for our stay!",2
1,Tried ordering online. When I asked for topping suggestions the guy hung up on me. Ridiculous,0
4,"Joey B's is a very comfortable neighborhood bar offering some pretty solid food.  We stopped in this past weekend.  I was looking for a place to get late night grub and that also had a Golden Tee machine.  I was suprised to find out that their full menu was available until midnight (at least on Saturday) and that they offer pizza until the bar closes.  We tried the buffalo chicken pizza.  It was a tad bit expensive for a thin crust pizza with minimal toppings but it was very yummy.  We also orderd the shrimp diablo pasta.  The shrimp were perfect.  The angel hair pasta was just ok.  Whoever takes care of the place does a good job.  Everything is neat, orderly, in place and confortable.  Our server was awesome.  Unfortunately some idiots pull a chair right in the middle of the walkway so she had to navigate through the restaurant to get to the other side of the bar.  Only drawbacks were that whoever was playing music on the jukebox was playing crappy songs (not really their fault), and that the Golden Tee machine wasn't accepting money.  I'm sure to revisit.",2
5,Filet and scallops were amazing! And the wine is to die for! Our server was fantastic!!! Best service we've had in a long time :),2
5,Picking up a roast and ordering meat for christmas;we decided to have a hamburger since it was late in the day and we didn't have any lunch.Sarah made us one of the best hamburgers both of us had ever had.So Porterhouse not only has great meats/seafood but a great deli and fresh made sandwiches.We love Porterhouse,2
5,"This is my favorite place to dance in Indianapolis. It's a gay bar, if you care, but you shouldn't. I'm kind of a picky person when it comes to dance venues. I have discriminating standards for the music. I can't tolerate a tiny, empty dance floor, especially if it's right next to an entrance or hallway and subject to random people crowding you. I hate when it's not dark enough and people sit at the bars and just stare en masse at the two people dancing. With those standards in mind, here is my club hierarchy:Space: Greg's has a better dance floor than the metro, casba and the melody inn, but is about equal to Talbott's. Talbott's dance floor is bigger, but Greg's is darker and there is far less ""parking on the dance floor,"" if you will. Music: Greg's plays better music than Talbott (with exception of some rare talents that pass through the side room, but the dance floor in the side room is no good), the melody inn is kind of a mixed bag for the electronic shows, casba has pretty solid music as does metro. Greg's really wins in atmosphere. You want stories to tell the next day? Come here.I love this place so hard.",2
5,"Is 5 star reasonable?! YES!I had turtle soup, pecan coated puppy drum, and bread pudding.The pecan puppy drum was sooo good! It had a lemon butter sauce and it went so well with the fish. I highly recommend getting it. The portion is just right.The bread pudding was to die for. It's a must to get their dessert.Get their dinner meal. $39 for a 3 course meal. You can't beat that!They also recommend wine to go with your meal so I really like that.This is a good place for a romantic dinner :)",2
1,Terrible customer service. They close early on no notice. Even if you call in an order to go they still will not take the order even if it is before closing time. They basically get to decide what service they want and what they don't and you can't depend on when they will be there.,0
4,"Diggin the new spot on the east side. Yall are doing some great work. If you've never been to edleys, definitely check them out. Awesome wings and incredible pork nachos. Would be nice if customers would be less crazy when it comes to snatching up a table but what can you do?",2
4,"FOOD REVIEWIf you're looking for quality meal that is quick and affordable, the Fountain has you covered. The menu isn't extensive, but it's got a good amount of inexpensive sandwiches, salads, and soups.  Their Cuban Sandwich ($10 w/ side) was pretty excellent.  The bread wasn't the traditional panini-style, but a French baguette...it was still great and had a little crispness to it.  All the main ingredients (meat, mustard, pickles, cheese) were in good balance.  As a Florida boy who loves his Cuban sandwiches, I would definitely recommend this.I also tried a bit of their Royal Grille, a grilled-chese sandwich with several cheeses, as well as apple slices, on whole grain wheat bread ($8.50 w/ side, extra to add ham/turkey).  It was damn good and hit the grilled cheese craving just right.  A side salad was also done well.For my side, I chose their ""spicy carrots"" which sounded unique.  It consists of sliced raw carrots that have been marinated in a tangy dressing with crushed red pepper, served in a cup. The carrots were cold and crisp and the flavors were fantastic.  The spice was just enough to be pleasant.  I would definitely get these again.Our food came out super quick and our service was great.  I'm looking forward to trying a couple more items and bumping this up to 5 stars.",2
3,"I don't know why i had such high expectations of this farmers market, but I did.  I guess I thought it would be similar to those I find at the beach cities of San Diego.I was a little shocked at how small it was.  It is one of the bigger farmers markets that I have been to, but I guess I still had those expectations.The location is really nice because you can also stop by state street for an additional outing.  However, I wasn't a fan of the group of homeless people and beggars that you have to walk through to enter the market.In terms of the vendors, they have the typical fruits and veggies, eggs, meat, flowers, etc.  I was a fan of this pie that I was given a sample of on my way out of the market.",1
3,"Food here is pretty good, but also pretty expensive.  Drinks on happy hour aren't bad prices though.  Its close to work, so its a popular work HH event place.",1
5,My wife and 5 kids and I really enjoy the experience... we go quite often... they do a great job accommodating our group of seven... service is predictable and great... they take care of our kids... food comes fast... and is standard Mexican fare... I really enjoy the tacos al pastor!.  It's a rare place where all 5 kids ask to return often... and that's a lot of picky kids to accommodate!,2
4,"Really solid beer selection - US, Canadian, Belgian, European.  Canned beer seems to be a point of pride in their offerings, which is good because they're near the Philadelphia Folk Festival which has a no glass policy (also PFF has a no alcohol policy but...)Samples available, always passing along the new knowledge and stocking the latest.  Goes out of their way to get good stock of beers offered in limited season.",2
3,"This place is good.  No doubt.  I like the creativity in the tex-mex cuisine.My sister in law loves this place.We had ceviche, it was ok, the texture wasn't great.  My husband really didn't care for it at all.Then we had our entrees, which were pretty standard, very decent sized portions and the taste was good.Not a huge fan of chains, we would go back if someone really wanted to go there, but it's not a place that we think of when we say ""HEY, let's go for some southwestern fare.""",1
2,"We started with the artichoke dip, big mistake. It was cold and the chips were stale. Mentioned to our waitress, but nothing came of it.  We ordered a large pizza, thin crust which after adding toppings it was a bit pricey for pizza.  Pizza was ok, not great. Except for not being our advocate our server was good.  I have been here before for Cardinals game, it was better then. Will try another venue next time.",0
4,"This place was recommended by our Air BnB hostess. The food is delicious! My husband and I each ordered the lunch combo, which allows you to choose a snack/appetizer if you order a noodle bowl. The watermelon and feta salad was very tasty, and the yakisoba noodle bowl was a big hit with my husband. The servings are huge! I had my leftover corn noodles (with tomato and arugula) for dinner. Overall, great tasting, high quality food for a very reasonable price!",2
2,"This hotel is not what I expected at all, the remote didn't work..called the desk said send new one and never did.

3,"Ok this is an aberration from my city foodie reviews but I figured I'll take the time and review some of the local establishments that I order from on a consistent base while working in Bensalem, P.A.  Without further adieu...George's Chix is good.  I'm always satisfied with the food and value each and every time.  I haven't branched out seeking much more than a good deal each time and trust me I'm not looking to find the healthiest option on the menu (usually I get the nugget/fries/soda deal, the chix fingers/fries/soda deal, or Ceasar wrap/fries/soda deal- $8 or $9 after a nice tip) but the food is alright.Give George's a try if you're in town and looking to get down on some fried grub!",1
5,We ate there last Friday. We arrived a little after opening and had no wait. We ordered what many have recommended. the Migas w/ Chorizo and the bananas foster french toast. Both were delicious and well worth the money. The wait staff were very professional and the art on the walls is interesting. We will definitely be back.,2
4,"I had the pleasure of staying in this hotel for a night and I was impressed. The best thing about this property is the view from the room. By far the best thing the hotel has to offer. Parking was extremely expensive at this hotel, but it is expected. I had one issue with the hotel. When I arrived in my room, as I was unpacking my things I noticed a Urine smell coming from the restroom. As I was headed to dinner, I informed guest services of the awful smell. When I arrive back to my room about 6 hours later, the room still had a slight smell of Urine. I decided to just deal with it for the night instead of moving to another room or informing guest services since it was extremely late. Outside of this, the hotel was nice. Would I stay here again, probably not but hey the view is IMMACULATE!!!",2
5,"Don't think twice. Come to Heffe and order the hot dog sandwich. It's a hot dog, butterflied and grilled, on a bun with the most bonkers flavors and textures. Extremely messy. Insanely tasty. Oh God, so good.",2
5,"Great neighborhood spot, good bartenders, good tibs.  They had a great blues guitarist in one Saturday, I think he plays Sunday nights normally but it was just a great time.  My bf is a regular and they keep him in tibs and lager and he's a happy guy.  If you're in the neighborhood stop in!",2
5,"Mrs. Ken not only did a great job waxing my brows, but was transparent and consultative too. Before she started waxing she asked me to hold up a mirror, showed me where I had over-tweezed, and advised that I let them grow out. She then showed me exactly where she was going to wax. The waxing itself was much less painful than I had experienced before, and, dare I say, relaxing? Afterwards, she asked me to hold up the mirror again, showed me what she did, and advised me once again to let certain areas grow out for a month before revisiting.Mrs. Ken is warm, professional, and great at her craft. I am so glad I found her and will only let her touch my brows for as long as I live in the area.",2
1,"I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights for the memorial day weekend. I had one of the worst experience in this hotel. When we checked in I saw bed mattresses and pillows lying outside our room. When we entered the room, the air conditioner was not working. So I went down and told the person on the reception about it and she told me that a engineer will come soon to fix it.After 20 min no one came. I had checked in with my family and it was a very hot day (max temperature: 94 degree Fahrenheit). This time I called the front desk and the phone was busy. I tried it few more time and I got the same result.I thought let me get few more stuff from my car and then call them again. So when I was passing through the front desk on my way to garage I thought of talking to the receptionist. I found no one there. I came out of the hotel and I saw the receptionist smoking and chatting on her mobile!!Eventually the engineer came and told us that there was a leakage in some duct. So we were moved to another room where the air conditioner was working.Next, the ice vending machine was not working on our floor. I tried it one floor below and again it was dysfunctional there. So I had to go to the second floor to get some ice.When we came back to our room next night (after spending the day in an amusement park) we found that the room was not cleaned. The bed sheets were in the same condition when we left in the morning. The trash was not emptied. The shampoo and conditioner were not replaced.Please don't waste your money here. I will never recommend this hotel to anyone.",0
3,"They have an excellent happy hour, so I'll continue to come back for that. However, the service is very slow. I'be been here a few times, sitting right by the bar at video poker, and I always have to call out for a server instead of someone coming up to me. Even though I keep playing, they don't come back and offer more drinks. Disappointing.",1
2,"I visited this morning. I was super impressed when I walked in. Unfortunately it took well over 20 minutes to get my latte, well over 40 minutes to get the one breakfast sandwich I ordered. The smoothie was delish but took a long time to get. The latte was delish but took forever to get. When a man asked me if he could get me something else to drink on the house as I waited, I said yes and he never came back with the free drink. Unfortunately this doesn't fly.  I love to support small business but this kind of service doesn't fly. Hope they work out these things because it's a great location with views and friendly people.",0
2,"We got here at 6:10p today 3/3/18, and with several open tables we had to wait 10 minutes to be seated, because they were backed up in the kitchen. My guess is there was 1-cook. Our Waitress, Rita who is amazing, had to make our drink order because the 1-Bartender was backed up. Staffing issues are hurting this place! It makes the experience bad for customers. The staff who are here have to work twice as hard, and still not enough to make the experience worth coming back! And at the end of our dinner, we tried to pay using the little computer that sits on every table. This machine would not accept our payment due to technical issues. The waitress even tried, and the people behind us and across from us had the same issue. The waitress went to get the acting Manager (female with dark hair) who upon having to come out to each table to get our credit cards, huffed and puffed, rolled her eyes, and yanked our credit cards from our hands and headed to the back area to run all payments. She came back and set all bills on each table, rather than hand them to all of us, with no apology, turned and walked away. I can honestly say she does not belong in a people business! Wow is all I can say! Will never be back!!!!!",0
5,"I purchased a Groupon for Wine and Canvas for my bestie's birthday last year.  You can go on their website to look at their calendar of events to book your seats.  The new calendar month is released on the 20th of the previous month.  We chose an event which was held at a little restaurant called Toast Wine in New Tampa.  We ordered sweet white wine, a cheese plate, and quesadillas.  All were tasty and palatable.  The staff was accommodating and tended to us well.  All patrons were provided with an apron, paint brushes, multiple colors of paint, and a canvas.  The instructor guided us step by step to create our paintings while fun pop music played in the background.  Upon finishing, we took a group photo displaying our paintings.  We had such a fun and unique experience and I highly recommend trying it.  It is great for special occasions or just for fun.  You can also book private parties.",2
5,"I eat here everytime I'm in New Orleans and always recommend it to friends. I can't vouch for their more lunch-y items but their brunch/breakfast stuff is AMAZING. The biscuits and gravy are one of my favorite items to get. The omelettes are so tasty and make me like boring omelettes again. Lots of condiments on the table (always a plus for me) and the service is always pretty good. Only cons (for some people, not really for me) are that its relatively small and theres always a wait on the weekends but never more than 25 minutes.",2
5,"How is this place not five full stars on Yelp?!?!?!?!This is the premiere, best, most awesome attraction. experience, museum in Indianapolis, Indy, Naptown!Seriously, everything here is great.  Here are my top six, cause five stars are not enough:1) Dinosphere:  Full skeletons in a fully represented habitat with light and sound; A mummified dinosaur that you can actually see the skin and muscle structure; Interactive instruction and a play dinosaur bone dig!2) Train's exhibit:  Complete with so many collectible toy trains; Many trains operating on rails with awesome miniaturized settings; A lot of educational stuff about trains in Indiana:  A real life steam locomotive that was driven into the museum on tracks built to bring it here to it's final stop; interactive fun!3) Fireworks of Glass: One of the most captivating exhibits ever;  A five story structure of blown colored glass illuminated by the sun and strategically placed lighting; Interactive learning on how to make blown glass: plastic examples of what is in the structure for kids to play with and build their own structure; Gazing for dozens of minutes!4) Archaeological exhibit: Learn about agent Egyptian tombs, mummies, Pharaohs and dig sites; Interactive put together a broken mummy's sarcophagus; Learn about ancient Chinese terracotta warriors and more interactive exhibits;  See a real life cannon of Captain Kidd having the sediment stripped away slowly over years using real science.  More I can't even think or describe!5) Scienceworks!  It is awesome!6) The famous carousel.  Yes it costs a dollar, but it's a national monument and it is free if you have a membership.So much more, but that is just a few of the things here that make this place awesome!  Even the food is great, the museum store with so many fun and educational toys, and Autobot Bumblebee there to greet you when you arrive!  This place is a child's and adult's fantasy playground!",2
5,LOVE. This tiny place is consistent & personal. The staff is always prompt & very helpful. The quality & pride in food is my favorite part. They are definitely accomedating if you have any preferences. I had only two places I would eat sushi at while pregnant (sparingly) - this was one of them. The out door seating is a massive bonus on a nice day!,2
5,"The coffee ice cream is a must-try. The flavor is great, not too sweet, not too rich. It is just right.",2
5,One of our fave St.Pete restaurants. We prefer this location to the Cantina because of the complimentary valet parking. Every dish on the menu is pure perfection. Personal favorite is the Santa Fe chicken. Reservations are a must. It's that good ;),2
4,I ate at this restaurant last night (Monday) which is $1.00 taco night. The tacos are good for the price. They also have margaritas on special this night. If you plan to drink beer you're better off for the money getting the $8.00 32 ounce mug.If you plan to dine on Monday get there between 4:30 pm and 5:15 pm because it's packed after that time. They also have live music on Monday. Enjoy!!!,2
4,"Visiting from Seattle and my first visit of Boise, I felt like I had to hike Table Rock.  Glad I did, HOWEVER, I must complain about the many plastic dog poop bags that I saw along the trail. DOG OWNERS, I MUST ASK YOU ONE QUESTION, If you're responsible enough to bring your poop bags with you, how come you can't just carry the bag with you until you find a garbage can to throw it in???????????????",2
5,"Stayed in one of the casitas away from the hotel and it was so wonderful, comfortable, and serene. Relaxed by the firepit and sat at the end of the dock at night which was a thrill. Loved this location and can't wait to go back!",2
1,"Went here today and it was terrible. Sam is always character which is sometimes entertaining, and the lunch special is priced nicely- but thats the only good I have to say about this place. I ordered the california and nashville rolls (i wanted the spider roll but I guess he was out of crab, or didnt want to make it) and my friend got spicy tuna and something with shrimp. Sam totally messed up the order. The spicy tuna ended up with my california rolls but i just dove in, unaware of the mixup. I cant even handle mild salsa so when i ate the tuna, it was so hot, i almost threw up, started crying and sweating- it was an awful experience. I tried to eat a california roll but my mouth hurt so bad, i couldn't taste anything and I totally lost my appetite. We didnt even bother trying to get sam to fix the order.It was a terrible experience all because sam didnt write any of the three seperate orders down that he took at the same time. I think i'd prefer to go to bar down Printer's Alley than back to sam's for a meal.",0
5,"Ok, this is not a 5 star, but I'm  giving the 5th star due to value for money.  The sectional that seats 4-5 with ottoman makes it comfortable if you want to visit with another couple.  Rooms were nice and spacious except for the tiny bathroom.  We would stay again and recommend to friends. Staff was friendly and helpful.  They had some tasty breakfast sandwich combinations. Tasty, made frequently, so relatively fresh.  Much better than most complementary breakfast options.Edit:  I left something in room and they are FedEx to me (my cost).  I very much appreciate their quick response.",2
5,"I was in Santa Barbara last weekend visiting my friends who live there and I came across Backyard Bowls on Yelp. This place did not disappoint. You can it is a happening spot, hence all of the reviews and consistent business. I give this place 5 stars because the service was quick and friendly. Also, it is definitely one of the best Pitaya (dragonfruit) Bowls I have ever had. They give generous portions and the taste is just impeccable! It includes strawberries, blueberries, bananas, a little sprinkled coconut, and granola! My friend ordered the Berry Bowl and she loved it as well. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who likes a healthy & delicious boost to start your day! Next time I am in SB, I am definitely coming back. Thank you, Backyard Bowls!",2
3,Huge portions! Only downside was our bad server. I really enjoyed my fried shrimp and had enough leftovers for a second meal!  My husband had the fried chicken which was delicious and he also had a ton of leftovers and he has a huge appetite. Would recommend if you're looking for some good southern food!,1
3,"Still running on EST, we arrived @8:30 on a Saturday to find no wait to be seated OR helped, ordering up the sweet potato pancakes with cinnamon cream syrup (good topped with excellent) with some borderline awful hash browns (really, people??). Can't say I'd return even without a wait, though; would prefer to just buy a jar of the syrup and apply it at home. Ended up at $24.43 pre-tip; no paper towels in the restroom and the day had barely started, so that was probably a dogshow.",1
4,"LOVE Lucy's for a quick drink or a yummy breakfast.  Beats the breakfast at the Renaissance across the street where we usually stay.  The menu has a tenderloin & eggs with queso over English muffin, which was a hit two days in a row!",2
5,First time we have ever been there. We are from South Florida and we're visiting. The decor of gators is awesome. The staff was really nice. The food was good.,2
5,"The Peppermill is beautiful, clean and easy to get around for such a large hotel.  It's the only hotel we will stay at in Reno from now on.",2
4,"Great luxury institution of Nashville. The wait can be long, but the atmosphere and vibe of the place is worth it. We got the potato pancakes and eggs, which were good as well as omelette. Apple sauce also came with it. Cooking here isn't fancy and reminds me of more of home cooking but great nonetheless.",2
1,"Went here for the great food I had experienced before. After HORRIBLE service, flagging down the waitresses, & being told they were out of all drinks except alcohol & water, my friends and I left leaving cash at the table to cover our tabs but did not tip. The staff proceeded to call my boyfriend a nigger & follow my friend outside threatening to call the cops.  I was disappointed in the wait staff but their intolerance & bigotry will definitely prevent me from ever going back.",0
5,"Loved the atmosphere and the coffee. Pulled off 101 looking for a snack, but when a coffee lover sees a place called french press. ..I had to detour lol.I guess you could call me a pesky customer. I had a lot of questions before I selected which coffee I was buying which were all cheerfully answered. I was intrigued by their cold brew and the batista explained process and taste and offered me a sample. Love the customer service thanks guys! Between my group I tried 2 blends of coffee, one french pressed one espresso, and the Tres leches coffee which was unique and yummy. I suggest trying it. It's sweet and creamy but not enough to take away from the coffee's flavor. If I lived in the santa Barbara area, I'd likely become a regular :)",2
5,"Real Mexican food - rated highly by Craig LaBan recently in the Indie Chain restaurant category and well deserved. It all about the sauces and meat prep for me and this place deserves 5 stars for both. Try everything according to your ability to handle spice. The chicken mole enchiladas are my fave of faves. Simple tacos with onions and spiced meat are delicious. Simply put, if you have a hankering for Mexican, you will delighted at El Limon!!",2
4,"Excellent.  Went there for lunch (the budget option).  Prix fixe menu was tempting.  Wife had the prime rib po'boy with the soup of the day (tomato fennel).  Both were excellent (the po'boy being an upscale interpretation, with gruyere and a really good horseradish sauce).  I had the seafood jamabalaya and seafood gumbo, also excellent (probably the best I've had).",2
4,"The sushi here is so much fun! I love seeing stuff like sunflower seeds and kiwi on top of the rolls. Very clever stuff. I had a great meal here. Twice! Lots of fun. I didn't try the fried stuff, so I can't speak to that.",2
5,"Wonderfully fresh sushi, amazing lobster fried rice with tons of umami, beautiful looking restaurant.",2
2,"I went back and forth before writing this review - but have gotten a sad meal here now three times- first we had pancakes that they didn't mix the things in and brought them out on the side after we waited 25 min, then we got almost well done burgers after asking for med rare and today I ordered French toast to go and it literally tasted like the bread from a grilled cheese. There was nothing French toast about it - it was griddle partially burned challa- completely regular bread in the middle, it didnt have a trace of egg soaked French toast flavor. it was as if they took the bread out of the bag and stuck it on  a greasy  fry top with whatever they used- threw the whole thing in the trash after two bites.",0
5,"One of my favorite places in town. This is a hole in the wall and not a place that you come to sit and enjoy your meal. It's really best to take it away, because the dining area is usually a little dirty.Family-owned and -run, there always seem to be the same people (and, sometimes, their kids) behind the counter.I mainly come for the tamales, tortillas (voted Best of Tucson for a couple of years, and they include one with most combo meals) and flautas. Man, those flautas... They also have what I think is some of the best salsa in the city. Not too spicy, well-balanced, nice color, good consistency... like a fine wine. I'll usually save their salsa cups for use with other Mexican food that I get later.If you like fake cheese nachos, then this is your place. But do yourself a favor and tell them to hold the onions because, otherwise, you'll find one has exploded in your container and it will take you two days to get the taste out of your mouth.The best part about this place though is the price: cheap, cheap, cheap! Most of the combos run about $5 and include an entree, rice, beans, one tortilla and a couple of salsa cups. I usually make myself a little bean & rice burro when I'm done with the meal. Good stuff!I'll only recommend this to some people, if I know that they won't be offended by what a sh*thole this place is. No, honestly, it's a really crappy building. But, if you can get past that, then you'll find the food to be great.",2
5,"My mani pedi at Queen Nails was great! I've been to a few places in Philly since moving here in September, and this has been my favorite place thus far. Lynda was GREAT and I definitely will be back!",2
3,"The previous review said Rite Aide is bad. I know pharmacist job are stressful and boring so their performance is not always smooth, but at this location I encountered not one but two's, and they're dumb.  First's, she didn't consider the time zone difference, I transferred from the PAC time zone, and the small mom & pop store opens at 10 Am PAC, means 1 PM EST. She's so upset and certainly that the phone number I gave her was absolutely was a bad number. I called myself, they have a recordings telling their hours. What they're missing is telling the hours are PAC, though I told CVS their address as well. Besides who buy medicines out of state? Except traveling?  Second's, a young pharmacist didn't know much has to ask some body and forgot to answer my very basic question ""Does my plan covers?"". When I asked, shows his impoliteness. I will transfer to Rite Aide, if my new plan is covered. I've been with Rite Aide before, they're better than CVS, my opinion.",1
4,These tacos are amazing and the price of the food is very reasonable. I actually don't love the atmosphere but I understand why it is what it is. Nashville has the theme of walking up to order and picking up your food and I suppose I'm just the type of person who wants to be waited on so it doesn't seem so fast food like. Overall can't argue with the great taste of the food. Plus they have mix and match bucket of beers!,2
4,Just had an excellent lunch here. I got the veggie sandwich. It comes with small green salad. Both were very good. Only complaint on sandwich pretty juicy so the bread got a little soft. But the veggies and cheese were yummySome other reviews talked about bad service at peak time. I try to avoid that. Went early for lunch. Service was great.,2
1,"Treated like an ashhole. Here with a group of friend who are into sports and they had to watch the cubs play in the world series. They basically threatened to kick anyone out who doesn't spend $7.50 every half hour.  I think sports are stupid, and wanted to walk out, but didn't want to leave the group I was with. So here I sit , 25 minutes later and the waitress who has the piss poor attitude finally took the drink order. The bouncer folks at the door and the waitress were all jerks about this game policy. I don't care if the food is good, treat people like an buttholes and I give a bad review. Edit.can of beer is only a 12 ounce....lol",0
3,"This is definitely a fun activity to do with friends, family, coworkers, etc. it's definitely changed since I tried it the first time. I went a few years ago and each stop was a bar, so we really really enjoyed ourselves ha. My second time, 2 of the 4 stops were at the circle then the WWII monument. Not that it wasn't interesting, it seemed kind disrespectful drinking at the  war monument, and when we were there it was Memorial Day weekend so all the flags were up. I felt kind of uncomfortable. I like the fact we do get to bring our own drinks and peddle and drink, wish we stopped at more bars like we did my first go around. But it's still fun! Hopefully they rethink the WWII monument, but besides that it's reasonably priced a fun afternoon. Parking wise was also different than my first time. We met at a bar instead of where they launch the handlebars. Wish they were more specific on where to park or where you can park. Some of us paid for parking and others didn't. Kind of all over the place regarding parking. But once again, very fun and I suggest trying it out!",1
5,"Yum! Yum! Yummmmm!! On a recent trip we stopped off at Santa Barbara Shellfish Company for lunch. We ordered the rock crab, chowder in a bread bowl and the onion rings. Everything was SO good! Of course my favorite was the rock crab. There was so much crab meat and it was buttery and sweet. It melted in my mouth. And the onion rings were battered to perfection. The chowder & bread bowl was warm and delicious. Can't wait for another trip to SB to have lunch again! (although I think I traumatized my daughter when she saw how the crabs were killed. lol)",2
4,"Four stars for the comfy recliners. Didn't order any food. First showing will cost $10 per ticket, $12 per ticket all other shows. There was a real bad sewage smell near the kitchen that made me decide not to order food. They had just opened up and only 8 people in theater. Guess they need to advertise. Looked at the menu and typical prices for food at a movie. Different from cinebistro as they allow kids before 6pm. $5 beer and $4 bottled water. Go figure!!  Website said $6 popcorn but menu says $7. Strange that they raised price. Didn't they just open?  Anyway it's closer than cinebistro so I'm glad for that. Also glad we went to see action packed Man of Steel or I could have easily zonked out.  Zzzzz",2
5,Great food and service with a nice menu selection. Had the Bacon Wrapped Shrimp with the most amazing Grits (found out they have Marscapone Cheese in them). Also their Gumbo Ya Ya (with chicken and andouille) was amazing.,2
3,"Beware the shot girls, they will take your cash....fast.  Very aggressive but outside of that pretty fun.",1
2,First time here and I had high expectations for this place with the high ratings. I was disappointed with my tacos and salsa. I love green spicy salsa and this place green salsa and avocado salsa was NOT spicy at all. I also love tacos de lengua and this place tacos de lengua had no flavor at all and they only give you one tortia per taco. They say hand made tortias and I was not able to tell since nothing had flavor. Wouldn't go back.,0
4,Hit this place frequently as i ditch the cafeteria at work & head to Microsoft ( dont need to be an employee). Great thing is you can order 1/2 portions - yup 1/2 the price too!  Food is top quality & well priced,2
5,OMG the Mediterranean chicken quesadillas what awesome sauce. Definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys fresh Greek food,2
5,"We discovered this place a few months ago and been here 3 times ao far. Everything is so delicious.  The roles are nice and soft with cinnamon butter, you can even ask for some roles to go. Too bad that we have to travel about an hour to get there.",2
5,"This will go down in history as one of my best dining experiences worldwide. The locations, the ambience, the service, the food..everything was top notch. The view of the water is breath taking, especially at sunset. I had the crusted scallops for dinner and they were delicious! My husband had the grouper and loved it too. For desert, we shared a crime brûlée which came lit on fire! Everything was exceptional!",2
2,"Meh...I wasn't impressed with this spot. Looking past the array of hand written signs and lack of available bagels, the food was ok. I got the pastrami, egg, and cheese. There was hardly any pastrami and the cheese wasn't melted. My wife also had the pleasure of adding spoiled creamer to her coffee. I think we'll just stick with Einstein's or St Pete Bagel.",0
2,"As the saying goes, first impressions last. After passing by this sushi joint a lot of times, ive finally tried it tonight. It wasnt a really good experience for me. Bad points first before the good. First, maybe because it was a Friday night thats why it took us a while to be seated, not too big of a deal. So I would suggest not coming in on a Friday night. Second, when it comes to ordering food, you must understand that customers who had already waited to be seated are hungry. So better make up on the service. We waited for like 15mins for our orders to be taken (despite the hand wavering- a call for attention). Third, more so another 20 mins or so for our rolls to come out! Hungry turned into Hangry! I appreciated their apology saying the kitchen was behind on orders. The thing is, shouldnt they prepared on a Friday night? Anyway, we ordered 5 rolls. Cant say they're the best cos ive had way better and tastier ones. The place is nice though, spacious and neat. The price of the rolls are good enough.In conclusion, service was not exceptional (or maybe its just our server) compared to similar joints and as a sushi lover, there was nothing too special and unique about the rolls.",0
3,"I have nothing bad to say about this place, but nothing particularly outstanding to draw people's attention to either. The bar area is nice, and there are like 5 or 6 rather large flat screen tv's behind it. Blue Moon and Shock Top on tap, which I like. There are a couple different entertainment areas, including a billiards area and an outdoor patio area which also leads to the most unique thing about this place...batting cages! Never seen that in a bar before...I didnt try them out, but thats gotta be a lot of fun when you're drunk. The bar was fairly empty when I went and they had already stopped serving food, which was kinda a bummer. Most places serve until midnight, Home Plate apparently stops at 10. Boo. The waitress did offer me the other half of her sandwich she had in the back, though! Thats...kinda...weird? Ah well, it was a nice gesture to a hungry man.The prices are fair, kinda average I guess. Got a half pitcher of blue moon for like 6 bucks I think, which filled my glass 3 or 4 times. Not bad. Id definitely come again, but probably a bit earlier in the night.",1
4,"Came here for dinner during our visit to the area.  It's rather popular as by dinner time people are starting to pack in the place. We ordered the pineapple fried rice and pad Thai. Playing it safe as it is our first time here and kind of keeping expectations low since this is a small town and we don't really expect good Thai food around the area. To my surprise the flavor is actually not bad at all. The pad Thai noodle is nice and chewy. And the flavor is savory.  Unlike the nasty pad Thais at some places that you can actually taste the packaged powder.  The fried rice is just right in its flavor.  Though it could be a little sweeter in my opinion, the fragrance is really aromatic.   Overall a nice experience. If you are in the area I recommend this restaurant to satisfy your Asian food cravings.  We definitely will be back if we are ever in the area again.",2
5,"A sushi place that delivers? Yes, please! Everything we ordered was great - Queen Roll, Sweet Heart Roll, Summer Roll, plus some individual sushi pieces. Fresh, well prepared, flavorful combinations. Cash only so plan accordingly. We'll be ordering from them again.",2
2,"Service here was excellent. They hosted us for an event and were awesome. However, I felt that is where the awesome stopped. The food I had (brisket) was mediocre at best, maybe it had been sitting under lamps all day? The bread it was served on was tough. The mac and cheese was pretty good. My glassware for beer was dirty, chilled, and they were out of everything on draft.",0
5,"This is my kind of place - they use fresh everything and the seasonings are expert.  The service on Friday nights is fantastic.  Over the years, the cooking has improved and is tastier than ever.  It's hard to get a seat, so plan on waiting 30 minutes on a busy night - that being said, it's not long until you are seated and promptly given water and they have real candles here.  I always order the coconut soup (I order it with the tofu ""not fried"") and also the yellow curry with tofu - also not fried.  It lends a more delicate flavor to the already rich curry.  It is to die for - tastes like dessert.  It is served with rice.Last time I ordered the Pho - my goodness, the bowl is so huge and served with two sauces - hoisin and siracha.  Very good and filling - I would order it next time with more veggies (they are very good at helping you with special orders)This is a BYOB and the prices can't be beat.  The menu keeps getting larger and I only wish I were closer to this place, as I would come here weekly for sure!",2
5,"Very modern and chic place down in Newtown Square off of West Chester Pike.  Food and service is excellent, and the place itself is pretty cool on the inside, always a nice crowd, and in the spring its nice to grab a table outside.  If you are turned off by the sports bar place after seeing a movie, this is an excellent option.  The steak and chicken is excellent.  Bar is also a great place to have a few drinks after a day at the office, with some friends.  One of the nicer places to eat in Newtown Square.",2
4,"This is what I would consider a fast-paced Goodwill. If you don't move quickly, you likely won't find much.That being said, I have spent many a slow evening looking through the clothing racks and scoring on items like a Tory Burch cardigan, new Kut from the Kloth jeans, and more. But this is not the norm, it is the exception. Thrill of the hunt!The housewares, furniture, and shoes are pretty run-of-the-mill. I rarely find anything.DO NOT GO ON THE WEEKENDS. It is a madhouse. Parents do not watch their children and I don't know if the workers say anything. If I could rate the finds at this store, it would be 3/5. Mostly mall brands (huh, is that a mall across the street?) and occasionally higher-end items.All in all, it's a good place to hunt, but don't be surprised if you leave empty-handed.",2
5,"My favorite of the chinese takeout restaurants in my area (in terms of taste and quality). I like that they offer Pad Thai in addition to the usual Chinese fare.Prices are on par with most other Chinese restaurants. The owner is super sweet. They have coupons regularly, no crazy good deals, but nice nonetheless.No delivery, sadly, but food is usually done within 20 minutes.",2
4,"So glad to have this close to home!Aside from making great Thai food, It's an undercover gourmet restaurant.  All around great restaurant and experience with terrific service.",2
5,"Great lunch specials for $6 or $7, entree soup and rice. Lots of variety for dinner with most entrees under $12. The food is excellent. Service is attentive. The restaurant is clean, modern, very pleasant. Enthusiastically recommended.",2
1,Just had the Thai rice bowl. This is a dish of 90% white sticky rice and 10% of fried chicken chunks and broccoli. Paid way too much for $.10 worth of rice with a little meat and vegetable on top. Would not recommend ordering this for $13.,0
4,"Good spot open space, welcoming decor.  Nice people.  Good soy latte.  Love the cool mural painted in the alleyway, lot better then staring at a brick wall.",2
5,WOWZA !!!! We had the best of the best experience today!! We have been here several times and the serve was so so.... However this time the service was outstanding!! Timely!!!! And tasty!!!,2
5,"Just really really lovely.  Great food, adorable staff, awesome service!   Really impressed.",2
5,"I recently went to this salon for SNS powder nails.  A salon I had previously went to put on tips and did SNS over them (which I did not like, nor want). At grace salon, they took off my tips and SNS polish flawlessly and preserved my natural nail.  They also kept asking me periodically if I liked what they were doing (length of nails, if i liked the color, etc.) which showed me they really cared if I was happy with my mani.  I really liked this place and will definitely go back!",2
4,"Went to this place with a coworker 2 days ago...very impressed by the sushi there because they are very freshly made with good variety. They have good price for lunch special - $13 for 3 rolls and $9 for 2 rolls...however, the portion is a bit small for those non-special sushies. I will go back again for sure...",2
4,"It's good diner food. period.Nothing fancy, just simple food made well. Breakfast is a must. Homemade Belgium waffle covered in TONS of fruit....amazing.Simple Said...it's good diner food at a good price with friendly waitresses. On a Saturday morning...what more could you ask for?!",2
5,This place was awesome. I will definitely be back. Great open atmosphere. I was surprised at how big my dinner salad was. Fantastic pizza. Excellent customer service.,2
5,"Finally got to check out Cafe Soleil. One word: Delicieux!! Being from France, I had high expectations, I don't play with my pastries! Boy do they deliver, the croissants were buttery, nice and flaky, and melt in your mouth...even better then some of the ones I had in France. Not surprisingly, the baker ""Nico"" is french, and you could taste the difference in the food.  The fact that the products are imported does make a big difference in the taste, it's definitely authentic.  Nico was very personable and friendly, it was fun chatting with an ex-parisian :). The one negative thing is they are too far from me, 45 mins drive, but to satiate my sweet tooth, I will definitely be back! I highly recommend this bakery.",2
5,Excellent healthy options for NOLA dining with lots of to go choices. I had turkey meatballs and spaghetti. It is a wonderful lunch place.,2
1,"I had a Groupon for a Shellac manicure, Pedicure and Paraffin hand treatment. I didn't have too much of a problem getting an appointment over the phone though Brenda was very short with me. Once I got there for my appointment with Brenda (which had been scheduled about 2 weeks in advanced) she was overbooked and asked me to come back later. I was unable to so she told me to come the next day.The next day I came back and was able to redeem my Groupon.It was a nice little shop but I did not see any sterilization of the nail tools. she carried them around in a coffee mug and there was nail dust everywhere, She made personal calls during my pedicure and was very condescending when she spoke to me about my nails. She also uses Bath and Body works lotion witch isn't a big deal but then she sprayed my legs with the body spray witch I thought was very strange and did not smell the greatest. My shellac bubbled and didn't look the greatest and my nails were uneven.I also never got my Paraffin hand treatment because one of her ""usual"" customers came in and she was too busy talking to her to finish mine and I was very rushed at the very end. She spent more time talking to others in the shop and on the phone than with me and was very condescending when she did speak to me.I will not be going there again and I will not be recommending this establishment to any of my peers.",0
4,"Really great place for wine!Came here with my dining group, there was about 20 of us on a Friday, for their Happy Hour. Excellent wine happy hour where all glasses are $5 or you can take $5 off any bottle of wine, which is a great deal if you're sharing with a few people...great way to try a few bottles.The food was also great! Cheese plates are the way to go here! Excellent selections! Several of my foodie friends ordered sandwiches, which looked & smelled amazing! They all raved about them!The ambiance is very warm and inviting! They do a great job decorating, especially around the holidays! My favorite space is the enclosed patio area, adjacent to the main dining area. Super warm and romantic on those cold winter evenings! The service is great as well!",2
4,"Came here and got my battery replaced for my car. When i called in they quoted me at a lower price then they told me when i came in. Overall got the job done quickly and my car works great now. Lastly, the people working there are very nice and helpful.",2
4,"I would eat anything they served me. I haven't even had the pancakes yet and I'm sold. The line out the front door and down the sidewalk should be an indication that this place is awesome. I just had basic hashbrowns eggs and bacon, but it was so fab and the service was great! I will definitely go back and sit down to eat. Parking is a little difficult around there, but that's to be expected.",2
4,"Great food, very helpful staff, small menu.  The clam bisque was the best, I also enjoy the fried oyster salad.  These two sides were enough food for me.  Salad had a little to much thick bacon chunks for me.",2
5,Very impressed with this place! The food was amazing. Quick service chipotle style line ordering but with high-quality Indian food. Also the staff was super helpful in helping me decide what to get since I'm an Indian food newbie. Can't wait to eat there again!,2
1,"This restaurant has definitely seen better days.  Pricey, attitude, garish recent redecoration, terrible food.  Too bad, because for years it was a quality, friendly, well-managed place--best in Harahan.  Bring Rodney back!",0
5,Best pho in Tampa...by far!!  Fresh squeezed orange juice and coconut juice with fresh coconut!,2
4,Italian food consistent and always tastes good when we go. Portions are good for splittingit was the great service i appreciate. Our server  Amanda was kind enough to run the items my son left behind out to the parking lot.  Never had bad service or food!! Luv this place,2
5,"This is my favorite pizza in St. Louis.  It takes a while to come out - so I either call an hour ahead if I'm doing carry-out, or bring my quarters and play Pacman while I wait if I'm dining in.  The crust and sauce are phenomenal.  My favorite toppings to order are sausage, pepperoni, green pepper, and onion.  This is the pizza I get when I have friends come visit St. Louis from out of town.  In my opinion, it's better to dine in because of the divey atmosphere and you are making sure you eat the pizza right when it comes out of the oven (as opposed to maybe 20 minutes later by the time you pick it up and drive it home).  Such a great hole-in-the-wall dive with the best pizza in town.",2
5,We go here all the time to get awesome coffee & just chill (: lattes & chai tea are amazing & environment is super welcoming!!,2
5,"The best total body workout I've ever done. My husband and I have been members for 12 years and have never had the same workout twice. Trainers are excellent, motivating, careful and knowledgable, plus they are really fun and make the workouts really fun and challenging.",2
3,tons of costumes and fun adventurous eerie electronic people during halloween. super packed for events.,1
5,"This mom and pop grocery store has fresh fruits and veggies at a reasonable price. My favorite thing about Goeke's is their herbs and spice section. They have the largest selection I have ever seen, and they even have custom blends for marinating and making dips and dressings. If you are looking for healthy snacks, they have containers of nuts and dried fruits. All in all it's a cool little store.",2
4,"Love their fries and sandwiches. Possibly best fries in town. Summer is getting close, grab an iced Eegee's drink and kick back and enjoy. Three standard flavors (Pina Colada, Lemon, or Strawberry) are carried daily with a fourth flavor on rotation changing each month.",2
2,Its a local bar that if you like slow service and bartenders that just cuss like sailors then go here....typical bar food cooked with no love.,0
5,Awesome salon in the area for your nail needs! Very reasonably priced too! Definitely worth your time and money!,2
5,This is our second time at sassafras. The first time we were meeting someone and the food was great along with customer service so we decided to revisit. The customer service was excellent! Food is so well seasoned. My husband is a catfish fanatic and he gives this place a thumbs up!,2
5,Drove by this place and decided to stop in while looking for a breakfast place and I'm so glad we did! The food was fantastic as was the coffee. The staff was very friendly and accommodating!,2
4,"I got this deal on hotwire great price, great location, and would definitely stay again.",2
5,"Just had chicken taco, steak taco, and chicken salad. Chicken was a little cold from sitting on the cool salad container. The chicken was fresh and juicy. The steak taco was delicious and had ample meat for the taco size. The salad had a zesty lime based salad dressing which was delicious. My regret is that I did not order enough food so my wife asked me to go out and get more tacos.",2
5,"Attended a party there. They now have a private room with your own bar and bathroom. I really enjoyed it. The buffet was good, didn't have to wait for a drink and you were able to hear each other talk. I would have a party there!",2
4,Great spot! Also has breakfast until 3 vs many places which end at 11. The eggs Benedict and eggs Florentine were delicious. Strawberry mimosa was a bit sweet but good. Bloody mary is bomb! Server was very nice.,2
4,"So our most recent visit earlier this month was very disappointing, however we received an email from the company's guest service, followed by a call from the Hermitage O'Charley's manager Chris who was very professional and apologetic about our experience and asked that we give his location another try on them. So I convinced my husband to do so. Here's how this 2nd chance went:: Absolutely wonderful. Chris asked that we let him know when we wanted to give the restaurant a second chance, but we decided not to. We didn't want any special attention. We wanted real unreviewed service.  We were seated in the bar because it was a very  busy night, regardless of that the server was very attentive and had a great personality. Our food came out in a timely manner, well prepared and delicious. We have since then been back several times and service continues to remain great.",2
1,"Extremely rude staff (including management). I had ordered carry out only to return home with the wrong order. My family has dietary restrictions so we could not eat what we had brought home. So I went back to pick up the correct order. When I got there, I told the manager at the front that we had the wrong order. They said they had my order and knew it was wrong. So I asked why they didn't feel the need to notify my or anything that we had the wrong order. The manager began to blame the employees. No apology, nothing. Don't let the renovations fool you. There was no sense of professionalism or quality customer service. I will not be returning to this location.",0
4,"Came here for dinner with local and out of town friends. Service was great and food was even better! I had the chargrilled oysters, seafood beignet, and blackberry jalapeño ribs. Washed it all down with a couple of Abita grapefruit. Highly recommend the seafood beignet!",2
5,"Best surprise in Nashville, with stellar service and an amazing menu.   Eggs Benedict the way it's supposed to be prepared.  A breakfast wrap comparable to none we've ever had elsewhere.   Bananas Foster pancakes designed to raise moods and blood sugar at the same time.  The place is always open and, did I mention stellar service ?!!  I'm certain our server ( two days in a row ) was Jillian.  If I've misspelled her name, I beg forgiveness.   She makes the experience wonderful.  This diner elevates the concept of the lunch counter to a social and culinary event.",2
1,"I have heard tons of good feedback from people about this restaurant and have planned to go eat there because of it. But i feel a bit disappointed in their customer service, i had been calling for a week for their catering services and no one ever called or texted me like they said, they didn't have prices to offer and only one person apparently does their catering quotes. If you offer catering and want to gain profit you should have something set. I ended up having to get a diff person to do it but was looking forward to their tacos. A bit bummed, maybe in the future i might eat there but I'm dissatisfied in my service as a potential client.",0
5,"I am so excited to have somewhere to get an acai bowl on the weekends when I am not in center city! I have tried the Boostin Bowl and the Banana Split Bowl and both were great! Everything is fresh and delicious. I would agree that the menu is a little pricey, but I don't mind paying extra to support a local business. Plus, there's a puppy to greet you at the door.",2
4,This unique pizza place is possibly one of my more go to places to eat with my mister. I have never been during a busy hour but I can tell you service is ALWAYS prompt and super nice staff. They have a decent beer selection and I haven't had a pizza yet that didn't satisfy my pizza craving. Perfect last minute date spot.,2
5,Best breakfast tacos i have ever had. The breakfast burger is phenomenal as well. Great service too! Awesome atmosphere !,2
2,Right flavor but the mac & cheese was gooey and undercooked. I would not recommend this place as a visitor.,0
2,"Shopped here a good deal for my daughter's wedding because it was convenient but only bought anything more than a few dollars using the 50%'off coupon....occasionally have a day with an additional 20% off the whole order so we shopped carefully.  Found many items in the store for about half the price on the internet so in the store so we stuck with the 50% coupons.   Today brought me up short.  I recently bought Prisma Colored pencils (72 pencils) on Amazon for $25.  Looked at them today at AC out of curiosity.  EXACT same set was $129.99.  This is a mid range pencil, not super high end - the set next to it was $229.00.  Prisma has very distinctive tins for their types of pencils so no doubt I was looking at my set for over $100 more.  Asked the manager figuring someone had mispriced them but this is their standard price ""not so bad if you use the coupon"".   Not bad?  I could still buy two sets for the sale price.  He said they sell a lot at a Christmas.  I'm assuming to people who don't draw thus don't realize they are being ripped off.   Long lines, customer service desk a joke and most of the associates do not know the store layout and some (not all) are obviously putting in their hours and could care less.   They advertise they carry fabric.  They really don't.  Just small, precut pieces.   The store has a lot, is convenient, and back in June had nice associates who helped with wedding projects.  They all are sadly gone.   Highly recommend checking prices on wedding items, art supplies and any higher priced item online before purchasing.",0
4,This location of Target is very well organized. The bathrooms are very clean. It's just way too different of my mood when I enjoy spending my time shopping here and a grab and run at Walmart. Also here is very easy to get help and staffs are friendly and helpful. The prenatal vitamins here is cheaper than Walmart too.,2
5,Have been using Kings for about 5 years for my business travel. Making a reservation is quick and easy. Drivers are prompt and friendly. Would highly recommend Kings for their reliable service.,2
4,"I was with a client and some coworkers looking for a place to grab a late lunch downtown, we were striking out all over the place. We walked in and the owner and what looked like his mother were sitting there getting a bit of rest before dinner service. Instead of turning us away, they graciously sat us and served us a fantastic meal. The food was paced well and it was prepared fresh with great ingredients. The Taj saved the day and kept us out of some crappy chain restaurant in a strip mall. Get a mango lhassi. It was fantastic.",2
4,Excellent amount of food with their early bird specials from 2-5pm. Food was average at best. People were friendly and everything was clean. Prices were pretty good,2
2,"We recently purchased a used car for my son, it was a 2006 and of course comes with no warranty because of the age, but I expected them to send it home with us in a safe condition. It was supposedly just inspected and had a brand new PA state inspection and oil change sticker from Conicelli. Needless to say we got it home and the next day the front left tire blew . It was completely dry rotted on the backside and the tire shop ended up replacing both front tires for $450. Money is one thing but after seeing how the tire just shredded we could have been killed on I95 on the way home. The tire just entirely fell apart. Never would recommend them now.",0
5,Best apple fritter in StL!!! Awesome prices & friendly folks. They had a very impressive selection to choose from. Next time I'm going to try a jelly donut!!!,2
4,"We found ourselves in South Tucson needing a good meal from somewhere other than the kitchens of the chain hotels surrounding the airport.  Thank you Yelpers for delivering another great place!A reconverted 1960's era A & W chain fast food stand [I can detect those old bone shards still!], we enjoyed a wonderful meal at a reasonable price.I had the catfish smothered in poblano sauce and melted cheese.  They told me it was farm catfish but it tasted like the catfish I used to catch out of a lake near my house as a little kid.  Farm fish never tastes this real.My wife had chile relleno - fresh peppers, not surprising this time of year but definite kudos to the chef.The late-stage adolescents with us enjoyed their enhiladas and chimichangas too.",2
4,"I love to bring Nick's virgins here.  I twist their arm to order a roast beef combo and gravy fries.  It arrives nice and quick and then I just sit back and watch and listen.  It starts with the rolling of the eyes and the huge smiles with roast beef sticking out of their mouth.  Then there is the OMG, OMG, sometimes muttered several times.  It's hard to understand them because their mouth is full.  This is all before they try the gravy fries.  Then it really gets crazy.  You know they like it when they start comparing it to sex.Add a cheap beer in an ice cold glass and it doesn't get any better than this!",2
4,I'm in town for a conference and turned to yelp delivery for an easy in-room dinner. This place looked good so we gave it a shot. The ease of ordering was great. Interesting menu with a lot of choices. Our food was delivered to our door about 10 minutes before the projected delivery time. The food was tasty but not out of this world. The portions were rather small and one of the burgers was over-cooked. Overall it was good though. I'd eat it again but I wouldn't go out of my way for it.,2
3,"Ok, loving the fact that when I wanna satisfy the taste for cheesesteak but since I don't eat meat I can get one that taste like the real thing and not some bland veggie version.  It's a dump inside like most pizza places, and the people that work there are so rude, it was a big turn off.  I'll just be getting delivery from there now on and not dealing with the clowns that work in there at the register from now on.",1
5,"A friend and I were visiting PA for the first time this Memorial Day weekend.  We were in pursuit of a good place to eat.  We passed Han Dynasty and like the ambience. We decided to give it a try. We sat at the bar area. The two gentlemen working the bar were extremely helpful and welcoming. They explained the menu to us. Everything is cooked fresh.  We love spicy food. The hotter the better; the food was so amazingly flavorful I would drive back from Washington, DC just to eat here again. I had the Cumin Pork spiced to level 10 my friend had chicken fried rice. We like very hot food most places even in DC cannot get the balance of heat and flavor right even when dishes are request extra spicy. Han Dynasty did!! The customer service and the food are worth giving this place a try if you like spicy food.  It would be a great business move for them if they opened one in the District of Columbia. Well done guys!!",2
5,"this place is amazing. i don't get cravings for italian food a lot, but MAN! their meatball sub is heaven... like i want one now... right now... not kidding... their food is always so fresh and you can taste it. at first i saw their portions and was all ""this is not enough to be called italian"" but half way through you're waving the white flag... but then the food is so nommy you just don't want to stop. and you finally do when you've used the last of their amazing bread to lap up the last drops of sauce... THAT'S ITALIAN!i never make it to gelato, but the one time i tried some from a friend he ordered ""chocolate covered bacon"" and the base flavor was smooth and delicious, the chocolate covered bacon part started off good... tasted like toffee... then this hickory smoked flavor comes in from left field... needless to say... i'll be getting my own flavors",2
4,"Alaska Airlines rocks, mostly tight to schedule and always nice and friendly. Can't wait for affiliate Sky West to replace CRJ's with Embraer 175's but flight is short so not a huge deal. I'll fly AS every time!",2
4,"I had been reluctant to try this place because I had several bad experieinces at the eatery that used to occupy this space and was afraid that perhaps they had just tried to rebrand themselves as Enzo's.  Well in the mood for a chicken cutlet with some greens I decided to give it a try. The sandwich was pretty good and they have the mexican soda's (coke, sprite, and fanta orange) at a very reasonable price for center city standards.  The availability of soda's out of glass bottles and made with real sugar instead of corn syrup plus the good sandwich is probably enough to make me a regular visitor at least every couple of weeks.if you dont already know about mexican soda's do yourself a favor and go find one, why not stop here and pick up a chicken cutlet sandwich and wash it down with a delicious and refreshing soda in a glass bottle made out of real sugar",2
5,Little puzzled by some of the negative reviews. I ordered the BBQ sub this afternoon and it was pretty epic. Would definitely order again!,2
4,"I eat here at least once a month, and more often when possible.  The brisket tacos and brisket quesadillas are fantastic.  Happy hour starts at 3 if you're interested in a late lunch for 2-for-1 drinks.",2
5,"Just wow.Other Philadelphia restauranteurs...eat a meal at Aldine and take notes. Fantastic vibe, super friendly and knowledgeable staff, and superb fresh seasonal cuisine.",2
1,They served me a frozen pizza and skunked beer.  'Nuff said.,0
3,"I don't shop here often but I do so when it's the garden-planting season and thus I'm ga-ga about getting some flowers into the ground. So I'm always in a good mood when I go to Albrecht's. They have a good supply, although the gardening equipment seems quite expensive.",1
4,Went to see the little trains of jingle rails. It is a good time every year,2
3,"Great food... Great environment... Lots of tvs... Tons of seating... SEVERELY understaffed. Was here for the Arizona vs. 2 Oregon football game  ...place was packed but was able to walk in and get a seat instantly... Lots of tvs, not a bad seat in the house. Unfortunately, every time I have been here there has only been one waitress for the entire dining area. Meh.",1
1,My initial excitement soon soured.  THERE WAS A HUGE ROACH IN MY FOOD!  How does one even handle that situation?  I just left because I was embarrassed for them. PATHETIC.,0
4,"I definitely preferred the pizza from nabruzzi, but Enzo's is still a good take out option in the area. I recommend their meatball sub and garlic knots. The meatballs taste homemade and of good quality. We'll continue to get food from here, but I do wish they would still offer the pizzas they had when it was nabruzzi",2
3,"Visited this restaurant for the first time on a Saturday night.  If you want good Italian food and reasonable prices, this is certainly a good choice.  However, I wouldn't give it five stars (or even four stars) based on this visit.  First of all, there was a considerable delay between the time we finished our salads and the serving of the entree (the server was apologetic about this).  Also, my Chicken Francese was tender and tasty, but swimming in an excessive amount of lemon sauce.",1
5,"Great dinner started with a wonderful fresh Caesar salad and bread followed by delicious cheese ravioli with pesto cream sauce. The pesto sauce was perfect, not overpowering the delicate pasta. I also enjoyed the Dunham cabernet. Delicious. Welcome to downtown, Richard's.",2
3,"This is where I head when I get that Texas BBQ itch. The brisket sandwiches are delicious, when cooked properly, and the sangria had me feeling nice. The atmosphere is relaxed. Nice bar seating.",1
4,I love this place.  Everything I've had seems really fresh.  The hummus is really tasty and the ambiance is nice and relaxed.,2
1,"Horrible place!!! I went with a friend to keep her company decided to get my gel polish removed from my acrylics. The lady was horrible she rushed to take them off and when she was ""finished"" I still had polish on every nail and she ruined the shape of my nails. Never going again!",0
4,"Arrived at 730 on a Tuesday morning and only one couple was already in the restaurant, we actually thought it was still closed cuz they forgot to flip the sign over.  So if you wanna avoid the long lines and long serving times, come early. Prob not the easiest thing to do when your out all night in the big easy, but now you know...show up early and you'll be fine.Upon recommendation from our server, I decided to go with the shrimp and and grits - which I thought was excellent; it had a very distinct flavor, and the lemon and garlic cream sauce really made it stand out, imo of course.  I would get this item every time I came here tho if I were to come here in the future.  Wifey had the Pecan and banana pancakes, which were very good, almost didn't need the syrup, but we put a little on there anyway. We were also interested in trying the Fried green tomatoes, which were battered slices of tomatoes (4 pcs), which came with a spicy aoli sauce, which were pretty good, though I could've done without them after the fact. Service was excellent.  We enjoyed our service very much, and again, since we came early, maybe that's why our service was very good, we didn't have to compete with the many customers who showed up a little later, fighting for the attention of the servers...Again, come early and you're good.  Otherwise, come in and try the food, totally worth it.",2
3,This downtown Philly donut joint was decent -- but far from spectacular.Tried a few different donuts and they were merely cake donuts with different toppings.  Too much of a cake donut taste (which I don't particularly care for).I can't possibly rate this spot any higher than 3 stars when the greatest donuts on the planet  (Beiler's Donuts) are merely a few blocks away in the Reading Terminal Market.,1
5,"First time at Tara's and I'm sure I'll be back!  I wish I knew my nail tech's name because he was really terrific. I came in to get a gel refill and one tip replaced. My nails needed a lot of work and he didn't cut any corners. I'm really particular about the thickness of my nails and I've had people give me gruff for asking for them thinner, my guy today did them perfectly from the start and was very willing to make changes when I briefly questioned the thickness (I couldn't tell they were perfect already because there was still dust on them from shaving them into shape). And in the end, the price was more than fair for the quality of work! Regarding the mani/pedi situation: I didn't get either but I witnessed one of each while I was there and I think anyone would be happy and relaxed getting one.Also, I took notice that the place was really clean, which is comforting. And they played modern music, which I prefer to the classical or sound machine noises some places play.",2
4,Great spot to get caffeinated. Minimalist interior and a paired down menu let's you know the focus here is on the coffee. Helpful staff and a great product makes this a great stop for a drink in St Pete,2
3,"I enjoy coming here with my hubby for grown- up meals and drinks. We allways have a good time with the wait staff, whom are knowlageable and friendly. Lunch  today was no exception, we had a supper yummy peach Belini frozen drink WOW! New Summer fav!",1
1,"Not worth the 50% off. I knew I had a bad feeling the second I walked in. The restaurant was a bit too hot for a sushi bar with fish sitting there behind the un-refrigerated glass all day. I should have listened to my gut but I made a huge mistake. I ended up getting so sick! Some of the worst sushi I have ever had, horrible service, and less than 1 star quality food.",0
5,"We went here for a birthday party and had a blast.Keep in mind this isn't a typical piano bar. There is minimal seating intentionally as it has more of a bar/club feel than a lounge. The place is pretty relaxed until about 10-11pm. Then they clear out tables for a dance floor. It has a very energetic vibe.If you want seating you need to get there early, 6 or 7, and camp out. Treat your server well if you are going to kerping seats all night. Choose a table on the side or back so it doesn't get taken away later in the evening. On a Saturday there was no cover when we arrived at 8pm, making it convenient for friends who weren't with the birthday group.Now for the birthday group reservation. The package offered free entry plus a drink per person and a few other perks. It ended up being very convenient for our group as it carved out an area where we can all comfortably hang out with seats as well as mingle with friends who showed up spontaneously. The personal service with the group reservation was fantastic. They take good care of the birthday group and make sure everyone always has a fresh drink in hand.",2
2,The food was mediocre and the staff was even worse. We waited 30 minutes for fried pickles. The only thing going for this place that I could tell was the atmosphere!,0
3,"Awesome interior & outdoor patio, decent food, but the overall experience was a bit awkward.  We came here with a pretty large group, seven peeps to be exact. The one thing that really bothered me was that all of the food we ordered literally came out one dish at a time. Portions are not by any means huge, and it was kind of awkward splitting one dish into seven portions or closer to 7 bites, finishing that off then waiting for the next order to come out. We had intentionally ordered a number of dishes to share but the wait time between dishes kind of made for a weird/awkward dinner experience.Anyways, on to the food. We tried the whipped feta, the bacon wrapped dates, fire roasted carrots, seared wild mushrooms, grilled peaches, tiger style brussels, brisket meatballs, chorizo gnocchi, & grilled hangar steak. Of all the dishes I tried, I'd have to say the whipped feta and the chorizo gnocchi were my favorites. The touch of honey in the feta on the slices of pita bread were a nice touch and that chorizo gnocchi was tasty and filling.Even though I didn't get a chance to make it out some of the breweries I had booked marked in Nashville, it was cool to see that Butcher & the Bee offered beers on tap from local breweries so I definitely capitalized on that. That's all I got on this one. 'Til next time, cheers!",1
1,"5 years into traveling for a career, I've never HAD to write a yelp review. While in town performing for a the week at The Playhouse on Rodney Square, our company chose to stay at this Hilton. After stepping outside to make a phone call and search for a bar of wifi, my colleague was locked out of her room (with all of her belongings inside.) After waking me at 2:30AM the front desk told me they are ""sorry I don't have the money in my account."" This required me to show them my BANK ACCOUNT. It is then clear that I have the money and have ALREADY been charged. The man at the front desk, Laison, told me he is ""just the messenger""... and then I was told by a random employee dressed in her street clothes (named Kamari) that they were going to call the COPS on me. What?? Great night, thanks Hilton -glad I'm an honors member.",0
3,"Three stars not because of food, the food is good but, the service is slow. I think they need 1 or 2 more people up front when placing an order if your waiting and not using the kiosk to order.",1
5,"Thanks to Penny, we had the easiest rental car experience! We didn't think to make a reservation.... but she took care of us regardless. Great social skills and even guided us to getting discounted snowboarding passes. We really appreciate the service. We were set up with a great four wheel drive jeep to keep us prepped for the storm coming. Really grateful for the outstanding service. We will recommend to others and continue to use this company.",2
5,We've been coming here for 5 years and absolutely love it. Sunrise skillet add chicken fried steak. Best chicken fried steak anywhere. And the service is always wonderful,2
5,"First of all this is a music lover's mecca.  I cannot say enough good things about Preservation Hall.  We showed up as recommended 45min before they opened the doors and were about 10th in line, sat in the first row of benches and proceeded to have the best time over the next three sets.  Having read that they don't serve food, drink, or have bathrooms I packed a little bag with some of Zapp's and a beer.  This is the only venue in New Orleans where music wasn't blasted at us from speakers...there are no amps, mics, or ringing in the ears, just pure and simple jazz.  My only regret is not having come here every night of our stay.",2
5,"If you were in LA the wait would be doubled if we were at home SFe NM the price would have been tripled! Bloody Mary w a beer back and another one of their signature cocktails was only $12!!! The food was excellent, creative and hardy. A highlight of our trip to Tucson for sure!",2
4,"Oh my goodness their Mac and cheese is to die for. Tried it for the first time today since they ""popped up"" at our office building. I expected plain Mac and cheese but it was soo much better then Mac and cheese. I also got their chicken tenders and the biscuit. Equally good!",2
5,"So good! Been ordering here for a couple months now. Always fresh, hot, and consistent. Very clean location with friendly staff.",2
1,First time I went to Earl's new American kitchen I liked the food it was good wasn't great but it was a ok  service not so great sat at the bar did not really care for a bartender tried it again second time bartender was really rude I would never go back there  or Recommend it to anyone,0
5,"Excellent time for my birthday great friendly cocktail waitresses on the floor nice pit bosses excellent food at cafe milano just need to see more happy dealers. Wasn't to happy with one of the dealers @ the Three Card Poker Table his reply to me and my dad smoking was ""you don't need to be an ASS with your cigarette""",2
5,Fantastic burgers and great selection of craft beers. VERY friendly environment.,2
3,"If you're adventurous in your food-tasting, I guess this would be the place to go.I came here during Mardi Gras weekend, and found it (after searching for 30 minutes) in one of the alleyways with very few people dining in. It seemed strange to me, as people on the streets were raging outside, why this restaurant was as deserted as it was. I soon found out the reason.THE FOOD was definitely not my cup of tea. We were feeling adventurous and ordered the Pâté of Louisiana rabbit & chicken livers and Pied de cochon""croustillant"" off the Charcuterie section. NOT WHAT WE WERE EXPECTING. Apart from the fact that we did not speak French and had NO idea what we were ordering, the waiter made no attempt to help us despite our questioning gazes. When they arrived, the croustillant turned out to be two small pieces of deep-fried undistinguishable meat (or pig's feet meat, not that we could tell). We couldn't see where the Louisiana rabbit & chicken livers were, but on the other plate was a jar full of questionable jam. We soon found out the ""jam"" was actually the ""pâté"" of the livers. Ech.THE SERVICE was pretty absent (or should I say absentminded?). When we first entered the restaurant, the host was talking on the phone with her friend/SO, and even though we stood right in front of her, she kept on giggling to the person on the other end of the phone. It wasn't until a man with a managerial vibe stood behind her that she hung up the phone and showed us to our seats. Our waiter clearly was not really paying attention. He told us he would bring us water with lemons and straws, and it took him 30 minutes to bring just the water, without the lemons and straws (but I guess I must be too picky). When it was time to ring up the check, he brought us a check totaling $100. Um excuse me? No way two deep-fried balls and a jar of pate could cost $100. We had to wait for him to come around to ask him if it was the right check. So in total: Time we spent waiting for service = 1-2 hoursTime we spent eating = 10 minutesGet the picture?THE ATMOSPHERE was pretty good. Dim lighting gave off a romantic kind of feel. The bookshelves were a nice touch. Made me want to grab a book and start reading it while waiting for service.",1
4,"This is a really nice Subway. It has far too little parking. The manager & staff were making the best of National Sandwich Day. Customers were everywhere.My BOGO subs were great. We got the spicy Italian & the tuna. Their tuna really is done just right! Not swimming in mayo a good taste.The spicy Italian was new to me but, quite good.What's a girl to do. Love Subway + a BOGO & I am a happy camper.",2
1,Terrible customer service! Avoid this place. They have a new policy to not help you with any set up of your phone. (My husband called corporate to ask about this policy and they said that they should have helped out.) They sent me home with the wrong instructions for setting up my phone on my own. It's been three weeks since I switched to Verizon and my phone still is not set up correctly. This place is a waste of time and is extremely frustrating . I wish I never switched to Verizon.,0
5,"South Street is super cool! If you visit Philly, this is one place you must definitely check out. The street seems to go on forever and there are a multitude of indie stores, bars, clothing stores, and food spots.My boyfriend and I ended up here to visit a specific store in general, then after ended up exploring more. Spend like an hour here wandering, it's worth it.",2
4,"Went here not realizing we had been to the West Hartford location in CT until the very end of our meal!  :pThis location is way better than the CT location.  In fact, we would not have gone back if we had realized it was the same place beforehand so we were glad we had forgotten.Staff was friendly and came by the table often.  The table side guac was really great (except I'll say light salt next time...it was too much for me but I rarely use salt in my food so for most people it would probably be perfect).Red Sangria was good.  My husband had the frozen margarita on the happy hour menu and enjoyed it...but be warned it's strong!  I would've been knocked on my butt if I had one.  :pI got the fish tacos, but instead of breaded and fried I asked for it grilled.  It was really good.  They could really invest in those taco holders though b/c all the juices made the tortillas totally soggy and I had to ask for more on the side.  Flavor was really awesome though!My husband got the chicken tacos.  Came on a hot skillet.  They were great!  I tried them and they had a great flavor.The churros are...churros.  Nothing special but a nice little treat.There were some great sounding items on the menu but we just really went for a light meal, so we'll be back again to try more dishes.Oh FANTASTIC happy hour menu.  They have a good variety of choices for both food and drink.",2
4,"Two of us came in at 6pm on a Friday. I wish they would rearrange the entrance and the way guests are greeted. I was standing basically in the middle of the restaurant next to a couple's dinner table. Three people asked me my name after finally seating us. We brought two bottles of wine which they kept in the back. I read some reviews stating that the servers get snappy when you don't choose to order a dish from each section. This is 100% false. Our waitress simply told us how large dishes are and based on how hungry we are, we may not want all of the courses. We both started with the beet steak. Ugh amazinggggg, very savory, unlike any beet dish I've had before. If you like beets, I highly recommend this. For my main, I had bass with red quinoa (i think). It was very fresh and the portion was average for nicer restaurants. We shared the chocolate hazelnut and caramel torte which was divine.My major down side was the wine. There were so many times when our glass was empty for more than 10 minutes. If you're busy that's completely fine. I would have liked our wine on the table. I'd love to stop in again since they have a rotating menu.",2
4,"I came here after hearing multiple different people rave about this place, saying how authentic the food was here....Well, they were right. The inside is nice and clean, with decorations such as fresh rose petals scattered in a bed of water with lit candles floating among them. We started out with a few appetizers; they were pretty good. But the great food was our entrees. I got the goat masala, which was incredible! If you've never tried goat, I recommend it; it tastes very similar to beef/steak and this restaurant prepares it deliciously. The other people I was with both got chicken madras, which was also good, but I liked mine better! All of our entrees came with a big pot of basmati (an Indian rice) and freshly baked naan (a type of flat bread) which was a good bonus! The service was a tad bit slow and it took a little longer than usual to get our food, but that makes for more time to visit with and enjoy the company of friends and family. Overall, you can expect well seasoned, tasty, authentic Indian food from this restaurant...and definitely another visit from me!",2
4,"Had the lunch platters (curry chicken and goat) and the roti here - the platters were decently sized and the curry was flavorful. The Mac and cheese that came with the platter tasted a little stale though, but as a side dish it worked out okay. I would recommend getting the roti instead - it comes out hot, with a substantial filling, and is really satisfying to eat. Would love to come back to try the juices or pastries - they have a pretty big assortment on the menu!",2
4,The best chicken wings in town!! The staff is friendly and they have a  great selection of beers!,2
4,"My husband and I went here with a couple of friends one night while they were in town. They really wanted to have some Korean food before going back home, but the place they wanted to go to was closed. So after searching around, we discovered Seoul Garden.We tried several varieties of food, and all were delicious! I had never tried Korean food before, so it was quite an experience and a fun change of pace. It was also fun to see that they had their television tuned to a Korean music channel...as I am familiar with Korean Pop (or K-Pop), it was fun to listen to. Only negative was that we had to wait awhile before anyone came over to take our order...it seemed to be at least 20 minutes before we finally were able to get someone's attention to bring our drinks and put in our food order.I definitely would love to come back and try more food!",2
5,"Albasha is a total hidden gem!! Do not let the sketchy appearance of this restaurant fool you because you would be missing out on some truly delicious Greek/Lebanese cuisine. I didn't realize this was a franchise until I checked out their website, but it seems like just a Louisiana franchise. I don't eat Greek food too often but I've been craving it a lot more frequently lately. I dined here for an impromptu dinner with some friends one night and loved everything we ordered.First of all, their portions are HUGE, so I'd recommend sharing if you're not starving. Two people can easily share one entree and be full. We split an appetizer of the lamb hummus to start with which turned out to be a great idea. The hummus was probably one of the best I've had. I was initially hesitant to order the lamb with it because I was worried it would be dry or overcooked but it was perfect and I could really taste the lamb. The pita served with it tasted fresh and hot and our server was quick to refill our basket when we ran low.For my entree, I order the beef kabob platter and it was DELISH. It came with a green salad sprinkled with feta, rice, huge beef kabobs, more pita and more hummus - I probably could have skipped the appetizer hummus but oh well. Our server had asked me how I wanted my beef cooked, medium rare, and it came out perfectly medium rare (You never really know). It was also very tender and juicy. I picked at my bf's gyro plate and it was sooo good! The other couple we were with also really enjoyed their food. One of our friends ordered a vegetarian plate, so it's nice that they offer vegetarian options.Must go back to sample the grape leaves and falafel. My eyes were bigger than my stomach and I really wanted to order these but there's absolutely no way I would have been able to finish it all. The moral of this review is definitely do not judge a book by it's cover.",2
4,"Came here for dinner but the wait was 2hrs long so we sat at the bar.... soooo glad we did. Firstly, jason is THE best bartender. He recommended the shrimp n grits for dinner, lets just say it wasnt only orgasmic because the flavor just explodes in your mouth, it tastes homemade and makes you feel happy inside. You also need to try the baked oyester for appetizer. I can die happy. Ill give this place 4 stars cuz of jason and his amazing recommendation and the ambiance at the bar. Tip him well!",2
3,"Unique items, worth a stop in.  Their silver jewelry is reasonably priced, and they have lots of silver chains in assorted sizes and styles.",1
4,"I have been ordering take out from this place for several years. The place is clean, good people and food is very good. They are one of the few Chinese places from where I take out sea food. I have tried almost all the items in the menu over the years and have no complaints. I am a low spice guy and like their chicken fried rice a lot. I will definitely recommend this place for take outs atleast since I have never had a sit in there.",2
4,"I will be eating here every time I go to Philly in the future.It's a little place - primarily take out, i think.  just two people in the kitchen prepping and cooking and waiting tables / tending register.the bibimbap is great - super fresh, flavorful, spicy (if you like it spicy- or not if you tell them not to make it spicy), filling without being a gut buster.if only every meal could be this satisfying and wholesome....",2
2,Okay food. The biscuits are good. Be warned! They will try and trick you into ordering extra sauces and spreads. It's almost $1 just for a little bit of citrus butter which is too expensive for the quality.,0
5,"On 3/5 (big snow day in Nashville) a couple of friends and I went to Local Taco in Sylvan Park for dinner.  When we arrived, the place was jam packed, and we knew there would be quite the wait.  I live right by Local Taco, and frequent the place.  Food is always delicious, along with the margaritas!  The Shrimp Taco is my favorite, along with the Local BBQ (try it out!)... My friend got her food on a separate ticket, and awhile went by, and I still had not received mine.  It took a little longer than usual, but I figured it was because they were so slammed.  A few minutes later, the girl who took my order came out and saw my number was still on the table.  She asked if I had gotten my food yet, and I said no, and she apologized and said she'd be right back.  Then Bryan Haas (I'm guessing he was the manager at the time), came out with our food, apologizing.  Long story short - I received AWESOME customer service from the Local Taco staff, and Bryan Haas especially.  They comp'd our food for the delay, and gave a gift card to return as well.    I told him the gift card wasn't necessary, but he insisted. Bryan also slipped his business card in there, which I thought was very professional and sincere.  I just wanted to give a shout out to one of my favorite restaurants and the all-star staff that works there.  Going above and beyond for your customers is what makes everyone love Local Taco so much :)  Thanks!  And see y'all soon!",2
5,Charming store with incredible section of loose leaf teas and all sorts of loose leaf tea pots and accessories. Lovely bar to sit and enjoy as well as outdoor seating. Staff were incredibly helpful and friendly and the tea is the best cuppa I've ever had!,2
3,Just OK. Good location for people working at Vanderbilt. Drinks and food are fine. It is really small. Take some cash with you if you like to play pool. ATM fees are too high.,1
1,"Had the worst experience I've had at a restaurant in a while here. Ordered take out and waited over an hour and fifteen minutes for our food which was just a breakfast sandwich and grit plate. In that time, only one employee came to talk to us, not to tell us sorry for the wait, but to tell us that they didn't have enough grits to complete our order.  The food is good, but not good enough to wait over an hour for.",0
2,This place wasn't bad but it's not my kind if Mexican/Tex Mex. They serve the Americanized Mexican food covered in queso and weird sauces. I prefer to add my own salsa so it's not drowning in sauce ultimately making my taco soggy. It's not their fault a lot of people like it that way. I'm still on the hunt for my kind of Mexican but I will say the service was OUTSTANDING!,0
4,"(Self) Verified CustomerThanks Yelpers. This was a winner. The portions were generous. The fish excellent - few get excellent for the fish. Simply said - why eat sushi - for the fish. Tuna,salmon, white tuna, yellow tail. GreatSoup ok but not why I was there. Service good. Price - always spend too much with my teenage sushi loving companions but pricing was a bit lower than some others. Had a spicy tuna roll as well - good for a roll.  Companion had Fantasy Roll - it was very good. Interesting if straightforward layout. Clean.",2
5,"Wendy and Leah at Preferred Rental Service are a life-saving team. They helped me to find the perfect place. Incredibly,  it all worked out in the very first try and within three days I am completely moved in and happy in my new home. I am grateful for their effort and would recommend their services to anyone looking to rent. Wendy and Leah were efficient and invested and clearly cared about the outcome of our work together.J.P.",2
4,"Been here many times now since moving to Apollo Beach. The pizza is very solid and consistent. I especially like the crust as you can take one look and know that it is hand tossed and not ""machine-made"" as some places do. I have not tried anything else on their menu. What can I say ... I'm a pizza guy!  Oh ... And they always honor their coupons when you check in.",2
4,"Wedged between two meetings on the northside, I had an hour to kill and needed somewhere new to make my mini office. I wasn't in the mood to hit Starbucks for the second to this week, so I welcomed the alternative option found in B&N. What to expect:-Starbucks tucked in the corner with plenty of tables -all of the stationary, books and magazines you could hope for -an obnoxiously loud after school crowd-friend Starbucks staff handing out samples -a generous number of outlets making the space perfect for hours",2
4,I ordered egg foo young and house chow mein egg foo young delicious chow mein was good also I also went back the next day and got the egg foo young again as well as the egg rolls and teriyaki chicken appetizer both were good although the chicken did not necessarily taste like teriyaki. I will still go back again.,2

5,"Fabulous, quick, stress free windshield repair. .. didnt cost a penny out of pocket. I would definitely use this company again and would recommend to anybody!!",2
1,"im a frequent backyard bowls customer and usually disregard if they make one mistake but this time was different. it started off by them not answering the phone when i called so i resulted in making an online order. i made my usual modifications, nothing major, no banana sub strawberries, no honey sub agave. plain and simple. i was greeted by a guy who fumbled in the fridge to find my order until he realized it was barely getting made. one of the employees was glaring at me and when it was his turn to put the toppings on he sloppily cut strawberries- stems still attached and not even sliced (no big deal im not that picky). he yelled my name for the order even though i was standing two feet away and he knew it was mine? i asked for agave, he rolled his eyes, and barely put any on top. I get back to my car and realize that he forgot the blueberries, kiwi, and 80% of the agave. called back to let them know the customer service was horrible and that my toppings were forgotten and was simply told ""uhhhhh okay"". i immediately hung up after i heard no apology whatsoever.",0
5,"My partner and I went here for dinner on our first night in NOLA! It was simply amazing! Attentive and friendly staff, great atmosphere and of course best of all the best food I've ever eaten! My partner had the soup of the day which was leak and Brie followed by the pork cutlet. He said it was the most amazing pork he has ever eaten! I had theses food gumbo followed by the BBQ shrimp... The BBQ shrimp has to be the best thing I've ever eaten! I love that they delicately put a bib on you and then you dig in! Honestly if you eat one thing in NOLA it had to be Mr B's BBQ shrimp!!!!",2
3,"It kills me to give only three stars,  but it's really just my fondness of days gone by that keeps me from giving only two. Upside:  They have great bar food and the best beer selection around.  It's a friendly place and the crowd is always un-stuffy and everyone is having a good time.  They've got a fantastic outdoor area, and the staff is generally pretty pleasant. The kickers:  This was my long-time local go-to.  I used to frequent at least a couple times a week hitting happy hour during the week,  and brunch or drinks over the weekend with friends, to the point this place has been known as my ""cheers"".  However,  I'm not sure if it's new management or what,  but over the past year or two,  the service has gone down hill. WAAAAY downhill.   You'll sometimes for for 20""+ before anyone even approaches you for an order,  and even sitting or standing at the bar,  the bartenders have become pros at standing with their back to the bar and not paying attention or getting your order for at least 5-10"".  The food is still good,  but they used to NAIL IT every time on the burger however you ordered it.  The last several times,  everyone got WELL done,  regardless of order.  I still go here,  and keep hoping every time that the service quality will return,  but unfortunately the area has exploded so it's always busy,  and I think they just no longer give a rip since they pack the place no matter how crappy service and wait times and food consistency gets. Luckily,  with the area booming,  there are several other great places now rights across the street and down just a couple blocks. Summary:  If you're lucky enough to hit this place when it's dead,  don't miss it. If it's slammed,  you're better off across the street at Beer Pale if service matters to you.",1
5,"Fantastic customer service both wholesale shopping and auto services. My tire was flat once and the mechanics went above and beyond (truly!) trying to fix it but eventually I had to get it repaired at a full service shop. The Costco employee felt bad and even offered to partially reimburse me for something that broke when they were trying to fix my tire (I turned them down but it's the thought that counts!). I will never forget how kind and hard they were trying to help me!Saturdays and Sundays are the days my boyfriend and I like to shop here because of all the delicious samples. The employees are all helpful, cheerful, and respectful. Place is clean, you'll find bargains, and produce is fresh and generally more healthy than what you find elsewhere. Some of the generic Costco (Kirkland signature) items are just as good if not better than brand names.Best of all, I hear you don't even need a membership to eat at their food court with bargain prices. $1.50 for a hotdog and a drink with free refills? $10 for a delicious WHOLE 18"" pizza? Too good to be true and yet it is!With competitive prices, gas prices usually the lowest on gas buddy, and membership perks, such as travel getaway packages, I found I have always made back my membership fee and then some with the end of the year reward coupon. Can't say enough good things about this place and the company. Big fan!",2
3,"So it's an old club and I think it still maybe a club at night but me and my family including our 5 year old went there for dinner! The food was good we received a sashimi plate and was very pleased with it. My some received a burger and fries which he ate and was happy with. But my biggest complaint is the SERVICE it was horrible. I had to get my own plates, sauce bowls and napkins, they bought out two glasses but didn't bring my son one. I had to request one for him, I don't know maybe they thought he was invisible. I had a groupon certificate so it was a good dinner I would come back if someone was treating.",1
5,"Excellent! The crab cakes benedict are outstanding, the best benedict I have had.  Highly recommend the food here and truly enjoy the atmosphere.",2
5,"I love this place, especially the cheese sticks! Hookah, atmosphere, sports games on the TV's, nice vibe and great place to meet/mingle with different people!",2
5,"This is such a cute place!! Perfect for a date, which is why I went here after searching high and low for nice brunch places in the area. I came here for that very reason in the summer and it was wonderful. My boyfriend got the mini waffles, which were soooo good. I had a pot of tea, I can't recall what flavor but they brought out quite the selection for me to choose from, and were so patient in waiting for me to decide. I think I also had an omelette. I do recall liking what I ordered. The ambience and service is what blew me away, and I'd definitely come back and check out the display case of pastries at some point. I also got a really nice fluffy biscuit with yummy honey butter. I would go back and would recommend it to friends :).",2
4,"Ok, tried it a couple more times. The Chow Fun was fun chow! Everything we've had has been excellent, except the calamari. Sad because their recipe sounds fantastic, and would be amazing if the calamari was tender. I don't quite understand how they could be so consistently good and yet allow one of their dishes to slip. Do I dare try it again hoping it was a fluke?",2
5,This is a great Mexican restaurant. Delicious authentic food and very good service. I will certainly return next time I go to St. Louis.,2
4,"Good spot, but definitely over hyped. If you go, be prepared to wait at least a 1/2 hour for a table. The food is pretty good, but personally not SO good I would wait 1/2 an hour or more on a regular basis for. In my opinion, the best spot for breakfast in Philly is Morning Glory Cafe. Way better. Bigger portions, better menu, better food, etc.Anyway, I had the Breakfast Po Boy at Honey's, which was ok. It was just scrambled eggs, sausage on a roll then drenched with gravy. I thought it was going to be more of a sandwich, but whatever.Also, make sure you get the OJ. Freshly squeezed. Like drinking an orange.",2
4,"I was staying at the hotel for a meeting and arrived late for the dinner so headed to the bar at the Red Owl Tavern instead. I wanted something that would not kill a diet but did not share that. The bartender suggested the mussels but they had cream in the description. I asked about it and he said the chef could leave it out. I don't know what it is like with it but I sure did not miss it.   HUGE pot of Prince Edward Island mussels cooked perfectly. Seriously -perfectly!  Took me a while but I ate them all. If you are eating alone note that you should not order an entree, this appetizer is a meal. They also make a mean Makers Mark manhattan!",2
5,Amazing. Delicious and well priced. They were super kind and helpful since this was my Fiancé's and my first time. We pretty much for a little bit of everybody in both of our poke bowls. My fiance made his spicy and i kept mine mild. Next time I might fine tune some flavor combinations but it was all so good I might just do it all again.,2
4,"Good beer selection. Not the best. Chill atmosphere, partially owned by the cast of it's always sunny.",2
3,"I'm giving this tour three stars because I don't have anything else to compare it to since we didn't do any other ghost/voodoo/haunted tours. Pros:-Tour guide was nice and somewhat knowledgeable of the cemetery and French Quarter.-Great price on groupon (2 tickets for $15)-Meet up location was easy to findCon: -Voodoo part was less than ten minutes long and it was inside the Visitor Center, which had nothing to do with the tour itself (used for a bathroom break and to purchase drinks/snacks)-WALKING tour -- when the tour was booked, I wasn't even notified that the tour would be in the heat-Though the tour guide was nice, she was very unenthused over the topic-The cemetery tour was about an hour long. It was interesting to see the different tombstones, however, how many can one possibly see before getting bored? After a while, it was a repetition. (MAYBE visiting more than one could've been more interesting?) -The closest part about voodoo was visiting Marrie LaVeau's burial site. The information given by the tour guide wasn't even accurate per shopkeeper in the voodoo shop that has a Marie LaVeau museumOverall, I got what I paid for.",1
4,"Drive from Fort Campbell, Ky to this place every other weekend .Love the place, many TVs to watch a game on, full bar , great Hookah, good Ma`sell ( molasses-hookah...), natural coal not the one that burn your throat, have it with some mint tea and you my friend on nice journey ..lol... would recommend  it to the new to hookah and to  the old timers.",2
2,"This hotel seems very nice in the lobby, but the rooms are sub-par. Ours was located on the 5th floors right next to the elevator with a very small window overlooking the court yard. It smelled like a basement. The only positive things I can say was the pillows were fantastic and the lady who came for turn down service was very sweet. I think this hotel needs to instill some sort of quiet hours if it wants to set themselves in the genre of classy. Having drunk frat guys making there presence know at all hours of the night is ridiculous. I also found out after our stay that my husband had requested a bottle of champagne to the room that was never brought. When he questioned it at check out the lady at the front desk was very rude and dismissive. I will never stay here again and I will recommend to my friends the same.",0
5,Tripped over this place while wandering around the garden district. The maple sriracha donut rocked my world and I ended up sharing it with three complete strangers while waiting for the bus. Needless to say we are all bonded for life!,2
5,"From the first step you take in the door this place is top notch! Clean shop, really professional and personable barbers! This was my first time here and got my hair cut by Ish and I have absolutely zero complaints the man knows his stuff and makes sure your cut is perfect! I will definitely be back!",2
4,"Went for lunch and got the chicken gyro. Nice place, good atmosphere. Gyro was delicious, just on the small side. Served with a side and chips. Overall pleasant experience.",2
4,"We stumbled upon Three Muses during our first few hours exploring Frenchmen Street. We put our names in for a table and had a long wait. But who cares! There's plenty to entertain you in the area while you wait. A late dinner at Three Muses was the perfect way to start our weekend in New Orleans: great food, local beers, wonderful live music, and friendly service. My group of four shared a bunch of tapas including: seared scallops, bacon wrapped dates, lamb sliders, swiss chard fritters (AMAZING), mac n' cheese, and feta fries. Almost everything we tried was great and we stayed for hours, listening to the music and ordering more tapas as the night went on. Definitely a gem on Frenchmen!",2
4,"My dad and I came to Philadelphia for a night from NYC to sight see. We got in around 5 and were pretty hungry, so we went to look for a place with good food that wasn't too touristy. We stumbled across this place and decided to give it a shot. We sat in the restaurant area since I'm underage, but I liked the atmosphere. Our waitress was really nice as well. My dad liked the beer and I liked the food. I got the pulled pork sandwich with collard greens. The portions were huge. I've never had barbeque made with vinegar sauce but I really liked it. For dessert, I ordered the Red Velvet Cupcake. Now, I'm from Southern California and I have tried red velvet before, but I couldn't understand what the fuss was about. I decided to give it another try since I was on the east coast. Best. Decision. Ever. I finally understood what Red Velvet is supposed to taste like. It was delicious! I felt like my sight had been restored and I could finally see what I had been missing out on. I was surprised to find such a great place so close to our hotel. I wish we could have stayed here longer so I could have tried more of the menu.",2
5,"Love this place! The owner and staff are friendly and fun, and the food is excellent. I'm from California, but visit Meridian often, and I'm definitely going to be back!",2
5,Pulled pork and fried fish are great.    Don't miss the sweet tea.  My wife had the white beans and cold slaw really good much better than my Mac and cheese and potatoe salad.    But a must eat if you love bbq.,2
5,They carry a lot of stuff . Seems pretty organized. Staff seems knowledgable. Nice and clean.,2
3,"The staff is nice and very friendly, but the wine selection is not the best and the food is not something you would order again. Nothing really stood out. This place has nothing good unique to offer.",1
1,"I took my family in to eat last Saturday after the Cardinals game and this place was absolutely disgusting.  There was food like half slices of pizza and ravioli all over the floor. Several used napkins on the floor and dirt and crumbs everywhere. I understand it is as after a game, but the amount of dirt that had builded up couldn't have been just for one day, unless the floors literally hadn't been picked up or swept since opening that morning.  Not to mention they were terribly understaffed.",0
4,"I've had the good fortune of staying here several times. Good time to go is anywhere between about September and December. That is if you intend to spend any time outdoors. The pool alone deserves its own review. Lovely, lovely views and two jacuzzis along with a poolside bar makes me -- and others -- very happy. And you can rent out a cabana and get the special treatment. I like that you are actually able to close each of the drapes in the cabanas and have nearly full privacy. So, this casino is still relatively new. It opened November 11, 2011. What that means is that you don't walk into the place and find that your entire body is cutting the cigarette smoke and smoke residue. You know what I'm saying. Have you ever been in one of those old timey casinos? Maybe in Vegas? You walk in and the cigarette smoke is so thick you can literally feel it on your skin, sitting on your eyelashes and glazing your eyeballs? Bleeccchhhhttt!!!Moving on in the review. So, yes -- everything is still shiny. And they have some very nice restaurants. I like Mr. Ans and PY the best of the, what, five restaurants they have here. Also, the bar areas are very nice. Trusted there is absolutely no way to get away from the clanks, dings and swirling sounds from the machines. That's OK. Just come along with a date or someone you are so entralled with and you will never notice. But -- what?! No taste on the wine?! Fail! Also, the room service can be so, so slow sometimes. But some of the other positives make up for it. So, yes -- I enjoy this spot and look forward to my next night over.",2
4,"Best Donair really does have good donairs.  I wouldn't day BEST but pretty darn good.  The first time I ate here, the man behind the counter talked on his cell phone the entire I was in there!  Even while he made my food!  Despite this annoyance, I returned to Best Donair because the donair I had was delicious.  My second experience was much better - no cell phone.  And both times I ate there, the amount of meat in my donair was monumental!  I have to admit, as an avid donair eater, I was completely shocked at the amount of meat they gave me (but perhaps that is where the name Best Donair derives from).  They also have ice cream for a sweet treat after your meal - if there's room!",2
5,We just had the best experience at Brick City Eatery! We sat at the bar area and watched the workers make the pizzas....so much fun. The pizzas were delicious! We will definitely be back! The staff was friendly and helpful!,2
5,My favorite go to takeaway spot. The ingredients are fresh and delish. Ever since I tried Poke I've been hooked. You won't regret giving this place a shot.,2
3,"After trying a few ramen places with crazy variety in their selections and stellar broth, I was not too excited about the ramen I got at Cheu.  Maybe it's a matter of taste, but personally, I was not a fan of their thick noodles, and extremely salty broth.  The service was great, and they had a nice selection of beers!  The friend I went with loved it, and has been many times.  Honestly, I'm just sorry I wasn't a bigger fan.  But I hope others try it for themselves.  I might just be an oddball out on this one.",1
5,"Definitely great experience overall. Nice clean room, comfortable bed, great view, on point service.",2
5,"This little unassuming shop is tucked away in a strip mall full of furniture stores. Had it not been for Yelp, I would never have known it was here. Now, I won't be taking a trip to Brentwood without stopping for a scoop!The flavors are quite varied and innovative. I had pumpkin and some sort of whipped cream cheese flavor--both were divine--which when mixed tasted just like pumpkin pie! The owner, Michael, is absolutely a sweetheart and is generous with the samples and the recommendations, and he's always coming up with new flavors to whip up. I can't wait to see what he concocts next!",2
5,Was traveling though Tampa for work and decided to hit this well reviewed restaurant with some coworkers.  Ordered the Curry Chicken and it was excellent but far too much food (I don't consider that to be a bad thing).  Service was exceptionally friendly and the person serving us told us that he owns the restaurant with his wife who is the chef.  Great spot!,2
4,"Mead -- I always thought of it as some old timey drink.  Boy, did New Day blow my mind with all that they have to offer!Honey wines, mead, ciders, and even mixed cocktail concoctions.  I highly recommend starting with a tasting menu so that you can try several different drinks and then settle in a pint of your favorite.  This place looks small, but if you see that door near the back -- head down the hallway to another seating area that is basically the same size as out front.I also enjoy that New Day supports many local charities and events.  And they sell local honey and other artisan goods.  A great stop when hopping around Fountain Square!",2
5,"Excellent service. The food seemed really fresh. Guac comes complimentary (AS IT SHOULD). The design of the place is super cute and it looks pretty clean. If you like Chipotle, you need to level up and eat here. Quit playin.",2
5,Troy and his staff always make it a really good time at the Macaroni Grill I've been here several times for birthdays and special events they've always taken care of us.Fantastic food fantastic people.Never had a bad time here.,2
5,I get the King Soup every time I go. It never disappoints. Great service. Friendly workers. Humble  Owner. Authentic food. AND BYOB. Can't beat that. The new fruit tarts they serve are a hit also.,2
4,"I went into this location to check out their new Dollarspot section, which I stumbled upon actually. I was originally here to pick up a few other items and ended up falling in love with this area (Dollarspot). Currently by the time of this review, they now have a whole bunch of really nice fall Decour to choose from and I ended up buying the place, LOL. The Dollarspot in this area is always that every entry of a Target. The prices either one $1 or $3.The remainder of the store is broken up into multiple departments which include the electronics, women's, menus, boys and girls (children), who Decore (which is even broken down further), pharmacy, health and beauty, Etc. The stores are usually very organized and clean, but not as packed as other superstores as far as crowd goes. I always enjoy coming in here every now and then either for gifts, groceries, or odds and ends, etc. The home Decore is usually unique brands to target stores. The grocery portion of the store contains the same products as any other grocery store consisting of major brands and also generic brands from target themselves.They have staff everywhere walking around with microphones ready to help you. They have call stations spread out evenly throughout the store so if you need help in a department, you just pick up the phone and call via phone prompts and someone will be right there with you in the next minute or less. I just love the crisp red and white environment in here (I'm pretty partial to the red color) they definitely pay attention to the ergonomics and environmental style of the place.  The stores attract people so well. It entices customers to stay. The checkout lines vary based on time of the day, what day of the week, and what season of the year.Some of the stores also feature Starbucks and other fine-in cafés so you'll have the option of never being hungry when you shop.These are one of my favorite stores to shop.",2
5,"With over 300 reviews and 4 stars I had to try this place while at a conference in Nashville.  My coworker and I took two buses to get there.  Thankfully it was a weekday and it was a bit later in the morning so they sat us within 5 minutes of arriving. I promised my husband (who stayed back in CA) that I would try the sweet potato pancakes, as he is a huge fan of everything sweet potato, I for one was hesitant.  MAN was it DELICOUS! It lived up to the hype! The cinnamon cream syrup...ooh the syrup....WOW I mean WOW! It was orgasmic! I mean really! I didn't know food could make a grown adult cry. As I ate my pancakes I wondered when I would return to eat this yummy nectar of the gods. I knew I would have to return with my husband...who didn't think Nashville had anything good to offer which is why he stayed behind....boy OH boy was he mistaken! Nashville has delicious food!If I knew that the syrup was that good and that they didn't sell it I would have take a big purse with me....beware Pancake Pantry staff I will return to take a bottle home with me! The ham was fantastic too!The service was quick and efficient. As soon as guests leave ninjas come from no where to clean the tables. The wait staff is friendly and they don't rush you. The area has some cute shops you should definitely check out!",2
5,"Life-changing pancakes, amazing selection and the waitresses' tshirts were really funny. Also loved the decor",2
3,Not bad. Sushi roll was good but options were limited. Hibachi grill: i got steak...chef asked me 2x how i like mine-medium...Still ended up with well done. Rest of my group had chicken which all voiced lacked seasoning. Beware they DO NOT have a late happy hour 8-11 as advertised on their website. We asked the staff about it and they claimed 8-11 was for a different location. Their website nowhere indicates the happy hour is for a specific location nor does the website indicate they have multiple locations at all.,1
4,"Who actually enjoys a hospital for anything other than new baby good news?  Although not the case for our recent visits I will say this hospital is very good, accommodating and very patient focused.  Those that I have interacted with try to connect with the patient and are not afraid to smile or use light humor in a non emergent situation.  They have taken excellent care of mom.",2
5,"I've been to New Day Meadery quite a few times, and every time I come I'm never disappointed! Normally when I come here I order the South Cider or the Shelby Blue Ribbon, but on my last trip I decided to taste one of their seasonal items. I tasted the Paulding Light which has cranberry, honey, and a touch of lime. It was pretty good, but was not as sweet as Shelby Blue Ribbon in my opinion. But that is what I like about New Day, they always have a variety of meads and ciders that everyone can enjoy, not just sugar fans like myself. All in all it is one of my favorite places in Fountain Square! Their service is always prompt and their staff always friendly.",2
4,"Great coffee at a great price , but few of food items are a lil pricey, like $3 for doughnut. Overall I'm happy I found this place =)",2
5,"Breakfast sandwich morning at work...it only happens once in a while but it is eagerly anticipated!  Mel's Kitchen sets the gold standard for breakfast sandwiches.  Soft fresh roll, 2 eggs and gooey cheese, crispy bacon, saltpepperketchup.  I keep on trying to find reasons to return for more!  My opinionated co-workers were also very pleased with their sandwiches, and especially liked the option of turkey sausage.  The breakfast menu goes beyond the sandwiches, and the lunch menu looks good too.",2
5,This place should be more people know it.  The price depends on  different material but always acceptable.,2
5,"5 stars because it is hard for any dental experience to be pleasant, unlike say a bar or an ice cream shop. The employees here are friendly and efficient. They get things done right the first time.  Dr Abrams actually listens and explains what is happening with your treatment, which is so hard to find in a dentist these days.  This really helped put me at ease, as I'm one of those people who fear the dentist more than the clown from It.  Their location is also super convenient (right off the 95 and 76).  Unlike most places that ignore the concept of an appointment I, was in and out pretty fast. I'll be coming here again for all my teeth needs.",2
3,"Nice location and nice looking restaurant.  Our waitress was good also.  Unfortunately, my husband and  I were very disappointed in the food, especially for the price.  We went in on a Thursday evening and the restaurant was nearly empty, which should have probably been our first clue.",1
5,"No, it doesn't exactly fit into the Hill, with its Spanish flair and sexy design, but somehow it works. The location is perfect, the building elegant and the interior perfectly subdued and romantic. The sangria is lovely and the selection of tapas is good. I always go for the shrimp. It varies in terms of what it's marinated in or served with, but it's always been good.I also NEVER go without ordering the Plato de Quesos - a plate of Spanish cheeses with walnuts, honey and grapes.",2
4,"This place started for us as a quick stop to grab a bubble tea for my wife and I. It was nice and convenient, located very close to my wife's work. On days that I would show up early to pick her up from work, I would find myself coming up with excuses to get a bubble tea for her and a smoothie for myself. This practice has aided in earning me a brownie point or two over the years. The quality of the smoothie/ bubble tea bar is 5-star.About 1 year ago a Taiwanese friend of ours paid us a visit, and we decided to try the actual restaurant. They have plenty of the typical American Chinese food such as orange chicken, but our friend recommended actual Taiwanese dishes. The results were a little mixed. Some of the dishes were absolutely amazing, while others were quite weird. Overall the quality was very good (based on the opinion of our Taiwanese friend), even if some of the dishes were a little outside our comfort zone.To sum it up, if you want a good bubble tea or smoothie, you won't find much better in Reno. If you want to give legitimate Taiwanese food a try, this is a great place to start.",2
5,"New favorite spot in Reno! Best muscles I've had in a sushi joint. Great menu options that aren't the same old rolls everywhere else has. The flavored sake drinks are good but extremely sweet, so be forewarned. Don't hesitate to check this place out. Great atmosphere and the best sushi!",2
5,"Our new favorite breakfast place! So glad we decided to try Brunchies. Went there for breakfast on Labor Day and we were impressed with the variety and selections on the menu. We were seated within 10 minutes when the place looked very busy. It looks like they work hard at getting you seated as soon as possible. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was nice. I ordered the Belgian waffle with strawberries and my husband ordered the Brunchies club which was so large, he brought half of it home. I love how they leave a carafe of coffee at the table. Our food was tasty and we will definitely go back soon. It's great have another 4 or 5-star restaurant in the area.",2
1,"I purchased a Groupon for a 3-hour cleaning and a three month membership to the Forever Clean Club. I am 2 months into my membership and have only been able to use the service in one out of four attempts. I was understanding after the first cancellation and simply rescheduled my appointment. After the second time, I asked to extend my membership for another month as I had gone a full month without having been able to use it. I was told my membership could not be extended as it was a voucher and I was given a $25 credit to my account for a 'future cleaning' in compensation. I have now been canceled on a third time. Today I didn't even receive a phone call. I received only an email, though curiously it states that they were ""recently in touch"" to let me know about the cancellation. Perhaps they were confused and were thinking of the last 2 times they cancelled? That aside, the email was sent an hour before the scheduled start time. Apart from the general inconvenience of being cancelled and left with a house that needs to be cleaned, I had left work early (using personal time) and was on my way home to receive the cleaner by the time I saw the e-mail. The e-mail provided no contact information, only links to Facebook and Twitter accounts. I found a phone number on a previous e-mail from one of the client account specialists who had contacted me following a previous cancellation so I called that number. I spoke with a lovely gentleman who confirmed that I have experienced a high number of cancellations. He told me that a member of the Trust and Safety Department was to have contacted me previously to follow up regarding my first 2 cancellations. I let him know that I had received no such call.  He told me that I would receive a call from that department, most likely later today, to hopefully resolve the issue. We'll see if that happens but I know for sure that I will not be recommending you to anyone and I will be contacting the BBB for a resolution if your team doesn't provide a refund for the 'membership' that I have been unable to use.UPDATE: The company ended up refunding me $20 (I was asking for $30 to cover the cost of the membership I was unable to use) so that was at least something. The person who emailed me apologized and told me that the frequent cancellations were due to limited availability in my area. I find it disingenuous to give that as an excuse after I went to the site, I looked at a calendar of available times for a specific cleaner and chose from those times and was even sent a confirmation. If those times weren't available then they shouldn't be listed. Limited availability, to me, would mean I would have a difficult time booking the appointment in the first place, not be cancelled on at the last minute. As they are a broker site (which I didn't realize at first) and not the actual provider company, these cleaners accept jobs booked from the site and I assume then cancel if a higher paying opportunity comes up.  If that's the case, there should be a system in place that penalizes the cleaners for canceling (since the consumer is penalized for a last minute cancellation) or better yet does not allow them to book through the site after a certain number of cancellations.",0
5,This place is fantastic. The food is exceptional and the service couldn't be better. Very nice and generous people with a cool atmosphere. I eat here almost every weekend. Can't beat the Cuban espresso!,2
1,Horrible horrible!!! Got a flat tire.. took them 3 hours to send somebody!! I know the flat tire happens but 3 hours??!! When I was only 20 min from the rental car center... I will never use them again.. I travel every week and thought I would give them a try..,0
4,"After my ROTD  yesterday of a different Sweet CeCe's location, I realized that I had never reviewed my local source!  Anyway, I love the product.  Love love love.  And I usually like their selection of toppings - good mix between healthy and not-so-healthy.  Sometimes the girls working there aren't really paying attention or are nowhere to be found.  Sometimes you have to remind them of their deals (like $5 Friday).  But I can't give it less than 4 stars because I just love it so much.",2
1,Decent food but have some weird priorities and service quality is quite poor. Didn't take our orders until after we sat waiting for twenty min. Food took fourth min and a gentleman sat down after us and finished his food before we even got an apology that our food would be a while. Asked for water and was ignored or forgotten twice. Decent quality food but not worth the wait or poor service. In and out would have been better.. I take it back food was rushed and salt bombs made half the dish inedible and the other half bland,0
5,"I've only been to Lex one time but I had the time of my life. I've been to many nightclubs but nothing comes close to Lex. I was there for the Chainsmokers event. The manager Will did an amazing job and Set is up with a booth in the perfect location. Our waitress Alex was amazing, always making sure we were doing good. The service was on point. Which says a lot considering that this was their biggest event so far. The music was amazing. The club is the best looking club I've ever seen. Don't waste you time and money going to any club nearby, you won't find anything as epic as Lex. Trust me, you'll be amazed. I will definelty be back.",2
5,"Mummy's Day off was a great service! I called and spoke to a gentlemen and then ultimately to Angela. Memorial Day Weekend, we had 2 energetic 8 year olds, and a house with a big yard and pool.We were on a wine tour so this was an 8 hour sitting job. She arranged for a sitter that was perfect for the kids. Johanna. She swam with them and played games. The first thing my son said was ""best sitter ever"". He doesn't really get left with a sitter often so he was a little apprehensive, she made him feel at home and they had a great time. Johanna also watched our dog! Angela finds you the perfect sitter to meet all of your needs! Great service, great result!",2
4,We've been here a couple times for their build your own hash! I ordered the salmon hash last time with poached eggs and hollandaise. It was sooo good! Only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is pricing. $14-$16 for the hash and it's not full service dining.,2
4,I've been here a couple of times and I really enjoy the food here. I always get the roti canai but I tried the roti telur which is an upgrade that is a bit more filling (I just really love the curry). I really enjoyed the crispy pork intestines and mee siam which were new dishes that I tried. Definitely recommend the kang kung belacan which is a vegetable dish!Our server was attentive and overall I enjoy coming here.,2
5,Amazing place! Mead was some of the best wine I've ever had! Atmosphere is perfect to get away from the center of convention/conference land...worth the cab ride!,2
3,"Good: view, breeze, weather on this day.Bad: understaffed, picnic tables as seating, and no drink menu. I think that the incredible weather and view save this restaurant from being 2 stars. The food was ""okay"", service was slow because they needed more staff. All in all I'd come back again for a beer to watch the sunset on a nice day, but not big on dinner here.",1
5,"The BBQ shrimp is amazing.  Be prepared to get a little messy if you order it.  They have the head on and need to be peeled, but it is well worth the trouble.  The shrimp are huge too.",2
5,"This is the best sushi location in the area. I travel often across the U.S., and Yama ranks at the top in terms of quality and price. I have never been displeased with any menu item, and the staff is always helpful in selecting tasty rolls and entrees.",2
5,Best desserts ever! Dark and sinister is AMAZING. Really anything with that uses the chocolate ice cream is my favorite.,2
3,Got an estimate but went with another plumber as this was the highest quote of the 3 plumbers we interviewed for the job.Very prompt communication though.Will re-consider for future jobs.  Seems reliable (and often you get what you pay for!),1
5,"My dad and I went here as we were traveling up the I-95. The food was really good and the server was really nice. The food came quickly, and the Cesar salad that came with my meal was almost big enough to be dinner by itself. It had a lot of croutons and dressing and parmesan on it, which is always a good thing. And the vegetable lasagna was delicious and probably enough to last me for 3 days (I brought the leftovers with me). They also gave us amazing bread, one with cinnamon filling and one with cheese filling, and there was enough of that to bring the extra bread in the car to snack on. The strawberry shortcake I had for dessert was also delicious. We also got a pound of cookies from the bakery area at the front and I've only had 2 of them so far but they are really good.",2
5,"So delicious, top notch food, service, and it's super cute inside. The owner Brad is really friendly helpful with the menu and just overall welcoming and makes you feel like a longtime friend",2
5,"The beer selection is diverse and impressive.  The food menu is unique in that it offers some traditional Southern cuisine, Belgian fanfare, and excellent pub food like their Khyber Burger.  They also offer a daily brunch from 10am-4pm, which is essential on the weekends.  The West Louisiana Hash was fantastically loaded with BBQ brisket.",2
4,"So surprised no one has written of this place. Quite a charming spot on a man-made lagoon close to St. Pete Beach.On Thursdays, they have $2.89 hamburgers (10 oz.) and half off condiments to go on the burger. I had bacon (.50) jalapenos (.50) and Swiss cheese on my fatty. It comes with a side of either Tater Tots, fries, rice/beans or cole slaw. Unfortunately, I chose the slaw, being Southern and all. Nothing to write home about but my friend ordered the rice and beans for her side and they were excellent.This was early afternoon, so not much going on. Waitress was friendly and helpful. She even said farewell to us after leaving the place as she was walking to her car.I'm sure it gets bumping in there at night but we had a nice experience and I wish I had brought my camera to photograph our scrumptious burgers. With several drinks, the whole bill was $30. Not a bad afternoon din din.On Friday's they have All-You-Can-Eat Grouper!! Would like to try that out and get back to they critics on other sites who have complained about the lack of freshness in the seafood.",2
5,Really attentive staff....finally people who care about getting you into the restaurant and getting you to come back.  The bartender was fantastic and the waiters were very friendly.  Sitting outside is really nice.  They could us a few citronella candles to keep the bugs away a bit but really not bad.  Also the couches outside were a nice touch and I'd like to see some table in between so we can pop in and just hang with friends.  Great switch in ownership and definitely give it a try...the margaritas are amazing as is the homemade salsa!,2
5,"I would absolutely recommend this place. The authentic Ethiopian food is something you won't be able to find anywhere else in Reno and probably beyond. I recommend the gored gored and zil zil tibs...both beef dishes. Ye beg tibs is a delicious lamb dish. They serve a poultry dish among others. One dish that my kids love is called alicha. Read about the bread they use to eat with called ""teff."" It is good for people who need gluten free diets and is also high in iron. If you hate eating processed crap that 95% of restaurants will poison you with, then try this place which uses natural ingredients and doesn't make you feel terrible after you eat. It's worth the price for this amazing cuisine.",2
5,Went in and spoke with the staff about starting this as a hobby and a way to quit smoking. They were extremely friendly and patient with my questions. I will definitely be back.,2
5,"Excellent bar in Ybor city. The owner and staff are unmatched in Tampa. Cleanest place in Ybor. They did a superb job of hosting a charity event for cancer survivors tonight, thank you for your hospitality.",2
1,"there's an awful stench the moment you walk in, the box spring had urine stains, and the pillows reeked! the only reason we stayed was because it was late at night as we were driving from texas to california. (convenient location right off the 10 freeway)",0
4,"We walked 1.5 miles (with an extra half a mile bc my fiance wouldn't use his navigation to walk there)  to eat the bananas foster french toast. He has been dreaming about this meal since he had it over a year ago. It was worth every step. I had the crab meat omelet with avocado and brie which was amazing too. The biscuit wasn't that great.Service was fine, nothing special and the tables were a little sticky but dont let that deter you.",2
1,"My husband and I came to this Bully's to watch the Nevada Wolfpack vs. Texas Tech football game on September 24th and before the 3rd quarter was over the bar replaced almost every TV with UFC. I understand the bar paid for the pay-per-view, but if they had mentioned this to us we would have sat at a location with a television bigger than the piece of crap tiny TV we are now in front of, and that was in HD, or we would have gone to a different sports bar. Plus for the second time in a row the service was horrendous.  You just lost a customer Bully's. Congratulations.",0
4,"A great place for a drink or a pizza. I really recommend the stuffed crust Chicago style, but any will do. They use a pepper sauce for a unique flavor. Somedays it's dead-on, somedays it isn't.   Beer prices went up recently, and sometimes it's just too smokey, but the 'Thorn does a great job of feeling like the perfect corner bar. I do hope to never see the place with the lights on.",2
5,Great little coffee shop with surprisingly ample seating. This get's 5-stars for the fact that they have the best coffee at the cheapest place in the area. The specialty drinks are large and delicious as well.,2
3,"The chargrilled oysters are amazing! The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is being the service was kind of terrible. My shrimp po boy was awesome, but my sister said her alligator po boy was just okay.",1
4,"The chicken here KICKS ASS. Seriously. I've never had such good fried chicken in my life. Crispy, thick and crumbly coating outside juicy and not at all dry chicken, absolutely stunning.You can choose from saucy or dry and they're both totally awesome, I recommend ordering half and half. Prices are reasonable and food quality is outstanding. Location is easy to find and convenient if you're on the south side.Why the minus one star? I called ahead to place a pickup order and still had to wait 15 minutes for it. The staff apologized and chalked it up to being busy (indeed, there was about 6 other groups of people waiting for their chicken). I didn't mind so much, but listening to the grumbling of others as they complained about their wait (I don't think they called in like I did, I think they just walked in to order) it sounded like some others were waiting much much longer.I will definitely go back, maybe I'll go at an off-peak hour and hopefully avoid a wait.",2
5,"What a fun little find. Busy first thing in the morning! Our server was spunky and fun, just the right amount of perfect service. My husband was starving and grumpy after our red eye flight in from Cali, this was the perfect meal to perk him right up! I ordered plain crepes with powdered sugar, they were thick unlike an ordinary crepe which was a little weird but, none the less delicious. I topped them off with some cinnamon-cream syrup. My husband enjoyed a meaty man omelet with a side of cinnamon and sugar pancakes. The portions are just right. Totally worth the extra 10 min drive from the airport.",2
5,Calories and diabetes be damned - fewer things could be better than gelati on days as brutally hot as the ones we've had this week.  Thanks for helping to cool us all down w your frozen treats.  Five stars for you.PS - visit the website for a little Vanilla Ice.,2
4,"Really, more like 3.5 stars. Very clean, light-filled atmosphere. Waffles were light and fluffy and fruit was fresh and in season. Loved the pecan coffee.Downsides:Unfriendly cashier. I was really taken aback by the general demeanor of the young lady who took our order. No hello, thank you or anything else for that matter. Two couples who came in after us grabbed tables while their partner waited in line, so we stood holding coffee and waters for about 10 minutes right by the coffee bar. I'd like to see Refuel be more proactive in preventing this, but I do appreciate the young man who was very friendly and broke up a 4 top table from one of the couples who snaked seats and squeezed the three of us in just as our food arrived.I will definitely head back to Refuel and I will continue to order BEFORE grabbing a table, and I hope you will too!",2
5,"It's a great place close to new hope across the bridge. The pizza is very fresh and crispy. Everything tastes like it was specially made right there. The inside takes u back in the past, very cosy. Would definitely go back.",2
5,"In LOVE (and now that they have been featured in a ""spots NOLA locals don't want you to know about"" feature, get your tail here before the crowds do!We've been several times during our month long stay in NOLA. There are not too many spots to lock up your bike on a busy night so get a flexible lock if you can just in case. The first part of the spot is where you may purchase bottles of wine. You enter into the backyard area with mixed matched table and chair seating and lights hung throughout the area (it's lovely on a warm night). Ordering from the set menu could take a while depending on what is available (items are not always available if you arrive later in the evening towards last call/closing). But, we have always been told when ordering what is available. You order at a window and get your number to place on your table. The full bar is upstairs and has indoor seating along with restrooms. This is NOT wheelchair accessible. The outdoor first floor area is, but that is all. Please keep this in mind if you are looking for accessible spaces.Live music usually on the outside area. The steak, trout salad, pork shoulder, bacon wrapped dates, and chicken were all delicious! We have ordered every single one of the desserts when we've come and our favorites are the homemade chocolate with olive oil and sea salt (really amazing!). We had a dark & stormy as our drink and it was amazing! Especially if you are into ginger, they do a house blend that gives a good burning kick we loved!",2
5,Really nice place to get a pedicure! People are very friendly and it is a relaxing environment. Definitely recommend if you are looking for a clean place to get your toes done!,2
5,"Connor was an awesome server, had a wonderful singing voice, and a great hair cut to top it off. For starters we had the nachos. Might I say muy bien fantastico!!!!!! I'm serious- out of this world. Heaping scoop of guacamole on top of a mountain of nachos. Then for my entree I had the burrito bowl. Wow didn't think it could get better after the nachos....guess what...I thought wrong! The chicken was cooked to perfection. Then our cutie patootie of a server brought us out fried ice cream- hit the spot! Thanks Connor. !! We'll be back before you can say 'ayyeeee que lindo'",2
5,"Loved everything -- had great cocktails and wine, steak tartare that was awesome, broiled shrimp was delish, curried goat dish w/ sweet potato gnocchi was the bomb. Also had a special dish, oxtail raviolini. great choice. New favorite!",2
4,"Good, fresh, clean. Nice folks. Funny soundtrack playing, but despite the 90's pop it feels authentic.",2
4,"I'm not sure why I haven't written a review for Pi before now because we have been there a few times.  This time we took my sister-n-law and her boyfriend who had been visiting us from England.  I shared a deep dish and my wife and her sister shared a thin crust.  All of us really enjoyed the pizzas of our choosing.  That is a great thing about Pi.  You can pick whatever style you want and also pick any pizza on their menu for your half. It makes sharing so easy!  We were able to enjoy our pizzas outside on the sidewalk which made it even better.  The only problem was our waiter.  Not that he was a bad waiter, he just seemed to be trying to hard to be some type of character.  He also kept telling us how busy he was when he clearly was not.  To me, Pi is St Louis' hometown pizza place.  (Not an Imo's fan! Provel???)",2
4,"Great service!  Terrific comfort food!  Lovely, fun setting.",2
5,The spot! Sabrina's is understated and so good. We had the chicken fajita melt as a wrap. The man child had the torta. It's a must if you're in the mid-town Reno area.,2
5,"My favorite place to get soft tofu and the seafood pancake! My dad doesn't like tofu so he gets the barbecue beef which he claims to be delicious! My family and friends all like coming here for gatherings. The decor reminds me of an Ancient Korean drama with its wooden benches, calligraphy and masks hanging on the walls. The waiters and waitresses are dressed in korean outfits too. It's pretty cute! My parents also like that they are able to communicate with some of the waitresses who also speak chinese.",2
5,Joey V is amazing! His precision and talent are some of the best I've seen in men's styling. He listens and talks with you through your cut making sure he understands your needs and gives great suggestions on styles and products. His fades are perfect! I highly recommend Joey V. His positive attitude and fun personality make getting my haircut fun and enjoyable too. He's awesome.,2
5,"Went here during vacation and it was amazing! So much so that we went back the next day. We have alligator bites and calamari as appetizer. The alligator bites are amazing with lemon, yum! I had oysters both days. 12 oysters for 9.99, so delicious. We also tried a crab trapper drink, it was ok but I'll I'm a beer kind of gal so I'm a little biased. Misty was our server, ask for me! She is an absolute delight and the sweetest ever.",2
5,"In lieu of a long review, I am going to bullet point why I thought this place is excellent, why I will be recommending it to coworkers and guests at the hotel where I work, and why I will be returning very soon:a) I love the ambiance. White table clothes, cozy candlelight, simple and clean.b) small, concise, excellent menu...every choice available is a delicious choicec) knowledgeable, attentive, friendly, sharp staffd) BYOBe) the duck literally melted in my mouthf) the chef cooks amazing dishes, his wife runs a tight yet comfortable ship in the dining room...I love a good husband and wife restaurant team, and these guys nailed it",2
5,Our breakfast here was great! I had the black bean cake Benedict which was sooooo good! And tried the blackberry grits which were yum! My husband enjoyed his omelette and the pancakes looked amazing! Service was quick and people were friendly. I would go back!,2
1,"Horrible customer service! Went into sprint explaining we didn't want a contract. Irvin assured us that they had a program that would fit what we are looking for. After having some issues with service, not receiving/sending text successfully and having the phones looked at with no success, as well as the fact you can't access data while on the phone hinders my productivity with work we opted to cancel service. We were told that with a lease all you would have to do is turn back in the phones at any time in good shape and you could cancel service. When we went to store they wanted $650 per line which totaled over $100 more than what the phone cost in order to break my ""contract"". They then said well your not on a contract you are just committed to the phone for 24 months and there is a ""option to buy fee"" you pay of you want to ""break your agreement"". I explained that isn't what was explained to us. On top of that our 3rd phone is on a totally different payment option of installments. So that is a totally separate fee for cancellation even though it's on the same family plan. These people are shady, and if you go to a corporate store they will basically call this store the red headed step child of sprint, and of course will take no accountability even though they told us our account was totally incorrect and illogical the way it was set up. So don't trust what they say they will lie just to get you to sign the contract and after 14 days you are stuck.",0
5,Pim the chef is amazing!  Just returned from Thailand and I think I like Pim's cooking better!  Thanks Pim!,2
4,Went to lunch today with some fella's.  we all got the Wednesday specials- I got the shrimp étouffée with a side salad. The étouffée was a good size portion the meal was delicious(9.99 can't beat that and if you can you can beat the mission of the cafe) The other two tried the pot roast with the two sides both were happy! For dessert we split a bread pudding THE best in the city. Great visit as always and the renovation are wonderful. Have been going to cafe reconcile for 5 years now and always walk out happy!,2
1,We used to come here all the time but we notice the quality of food is not the same and the prices go up we had the chicken Parmesan it was so rubbery and the pasta was hard like it wasn't boiled long enough they also got rid of the nachos which were my fav the movie screen is brightness is also very low sometimes I can't make out what's going on hopefully they can fix these simple issues on the plus side the chairs are very comfortable,0
5,"I had just moved to Nashville and one of my friends told me I HAD to come here. We're not both from here originally so technically we were still tourists at this point. Anyways, I went around 9:15 and the line wasn't too bad - I'd say a 5-10 minute wait. The food was awesome. I had the chocolate chip pancakes which were to die for. The sausage side I had didn't rock my world then again it's not the Side Dish Pantry. You don't pay at the table - they ring you up by the door to try and get people in and out fast which seems to work because the line is always moving fairly fast. Rip : I drive by it almost every morning - if you want to avoid the line go either RIGHT when they open to around 7:15",2
4,"I come here all the time.  They have a great beer selection.  They have great service in the bar.  The dining area can be really slow, but I always go when it is busy, so that might explain it.  Love the taco salad with beef, the wings, sandwiches and the ovals!",2
5,the handmade orangina is delicious-better than the bottled version! and the croissant sandwiches are amazing!,2
4,"BBQ Chicken Sandwich only $5.75? Nice. Chicken was nicely grilled, your choice of topppings / sacues, pretty neat.Grilled sourdough, wheat bun or white bun -- quite a few options to choose from, at a great price.",2
5,"One of the best meals I have ever eaten; took a few colleagues here for a celebration and it met our expectations in every way.  Had appetizers and a pork plate; cocktails and wine were on point, and the service was very professional.  Strongest recommendstion",2
5,"Had to check out this spot seen on every YouTube vlog ever. Luckily for us, our Airbnb was only 2 blocks away!When you walk inside, you can purchase bottles of wine and cheese to enjoy outside. If you'd like to try their tapas, head outside and order at the window. There's also a bar serving other drinks upstairs.They have live music every night at 7:30pm. We went around 9pm and enjoyed a selection of tapas and their risotto. I was very fond of their pickled veggies and patatas bravas.Great food, great prices, great hangs for a perfect evening.",2
5,"Great place, my husband and I have been eating here easily for 10 years every Friday night. There food is great, pizza many varieties to choose from in addition to other great Italian dinner dishes, great desserts too.We have since moved and are no longer in the vicinity however we just took a trip over there recently as we are now 1 hour away from The Upper Crust and the food is still great as ever. Worth the trip for sure. They have some of the same staff from prior years still working there, they are still as always very helpful and pleasant.",2
4,"The service and ambience are great, the food was fine. We ordered the nachos and the chicken grinder. Nachos were good (although I will NEVER understand why Boise puts olives on nachos). The grinder had a spicy sauce I didn't like but the husband did. The chicken on both was good. Very attentive servers, we went on an afternoon and they were extremely welcoming to our small kid. We really liked the decor of the place and the bar is huge. Husband had the Locomotive Dry Stout and was happy. They have some limited outdoor seating and offer four for $4 beer flights. Glad to have this place on the west side of town, definitely a good addition to the fairgrounds area.",2

5,"In Tucson for work and it was lunch time.  This is a Small place on the side of the road in a dirt kind of lot. Looks a bit shady from the outside and definitely wouldn't have stopped if we weren't told the place was good.  I ordered 12 wings and split the flavors between the garlic Parmesan and the medium buffalo, The wings came out and i realized that it was WAY more food then expected since the wings were gigantic.  they were cooked perfect and the flavoring on both were amazing.  My friend ordered the chicken tenders and a basket of bacon cheese fries.  the fries were awesome and enough to be a meal by itself, the 12 tenders was enough food for 2 people!  overall, the food was amazing, prices were very reasonable for the quality and the amount of food, and the girls working we all friendly and nice to look at.  can't wait till i'm back for work and can stop in again!",2
1,"I ordered the ""special"" pasta with mushrooms and a Hef...didnt feel so good afterwards...",0
3,"Met a friend for dinner there about 5pm, based on his recommendation.  We tried some of the craft beer - the porter was very good.  Ordered dinner, ribs and brisket combination.  The brisket was moist and held together well, but not too fatty.  The ribs were flavorful as well.  What was disappointing though, was the portion size.  My friend and I both, almost simultaneously, mentioned how small the serving size was for the price. Our server was prompt, attentive and friendly. Will I go back next time I'm in town?  Probably.  But next time I'll try lunch and a sandwich.",1
4,Wonderful wonderful food and service! We had an outstanding lunch amid bonus that it was directly across the street from our hotel.  1 star off for service on the next day - I called that morning to order a to go to take with me for my long flight home.  I specified pick up time. When I got there they said the person who took the order forgot about it.  It wasn't ready and I couldn't wait as I had to leave for the airport. Disappointed when I had to have airport food instead.,2
5,"As usual G and I had 2 great meals to celebrate his birthday of Wednesday. Food and service, as usual, was spectacular. The birthday boy had the prime rib. I always have th gyro salad, which is my fav.",2
2,We stopped in after picking my friend up at the airport. I should have read the reviews before hand as we experienced the SAME ISSUES on undercooked steaks! I should have known it was going to happen as the server asked us to cut into our steak while she waited. Both were supposed to be medium and they came out blue rare!! Now we have cut into them so all the juices exit the meat and upon re-cooking the steaks became dry. During our meal I noticed the table next to us had sent back their steaks as well due to under cooking!Does a national chain not have the ability to properly cook a steak??? I think not........,0
2,"Just tried the newly opened Wheel Cafe in Dunedin. Let me start with the positives. I liked the set-up & decor. I prefer a small menu, which they deliver on. Better to do a few things well, than a lot of things meh or bad. It serves both breakfast & lunch & even though they were into their lunch menu, they were willing to do breakfast for me. The waitress was pleasant, but the owner?? hoovered a bit too much.I opted for a burger & a bowl of their soup of the day, Potato Leek. What I am about to say is meant for constructive purposes & not to be taken as digs. If you are going to offer up trendy food, you need to be better at seasoning your dishes & food temps. The potato leek soup was bland & had no distinctive potato or leek flavor. The burger, ordred medium, came out more rare than medium and also lacked favor. Chips on the side also lacked salt. If you want to appeal to customers who can appreciate your menu, please up your salt & pepper game. And your cook temps.",0
5,"Nothing more to say than this is the BEST donut place ever. I literally wished they shipped their products. When I moved to Florida, I missed it so much. It's only in New Orleans... sad face!",2
5,"Not sure why it took until now for us to find this place. We started out going to the chain lobster restaurant but wanted something more authentic. A friend recommended Lobster Haven and I checked it out online. Looked like a type of place we would eat at in Massachusetts when we visit family. We were not disappointed! Service was great, fast and very friendly. Huge selection of all of the favorites. You have to visit this place if you want authentic New England seafood. You can also purchase live lobster and fresh seafood to go and cook it yourself.",2
1,So I'm not sure what the big deal is over this place. Your Clarksville Tn location has nothing but positive reviews. We were looking forward to having a nice family dinner at your Springfield location tonight. However that sadly did not happen my husband found his food bland and lacking seasoning of any kind he ordered just a simple cheeseburger. And I ordered your salmon with a Baked potato and garden salad. My Salmon was RAW in the middle and I don't mean just slightly pink there was a good half a inch to a inch worth of RAW salmon I sent it back to be recooked. Well when it came back out it was clear my dinner had been place in most likely a Microwave  the ends that I had pulled apart for my 8 year old to eat prior to realizing the fish was RAW  were now so dry and curled over. When I asked the manager who brought me my food back if they microwaved my fish I was told NO. Problem here my fish came back to me the exact way I sent it to be recooked nothing on the plate was out of place. My husband and I are truly disappointed we had high hopes for PBODY'S.,0
3,Food and drinks were really good...service was...not so good.Saturday afternoon...2pm...3 waiters...2 just wondering around aimless and one running around trying to get the job done.  Hard to blame him but things we ordered we missed...otherwise I would have given them 5 stars.,1
4,"The place where franklin's stands now, has been playing russian roulette as a lot of earlier tenants have come and gone, but i hope franklin's is here to stay ! It's quite a laid back neighborhood  place with bunch of screens where u can even catch ur favorite teams play.I don't know how long the deal is gonna last , but franklin's has the best happy hour deals on this side of the Schuylkill ! A lot of juicy 0.25 cent wings we gorged upon ferociously whilst trying to pay attention to the bingo numbers being called out in the background , on once a Wednesday. With a tonne of seating and an uber friendly staff  that goes along with a solid beer choices and a bunch of well drinks on the cheap , Franklin's certainly makes for one helluva night out in the burbs of east falls ...",2
5,"In town for the weekend and craving some down home Cajun cuisine, debated this place because they have multiple locations and did not want the usual chain feel, boy did they exceed expectations in every way!!! Fast and friendly customer service, host at the counter was super friendly and willing to split portions to give me a chance to sample. Food literally came out before I could sit down, hot, fresh, incredible presentation and taste!! Authentic is the best description!!",2
3,"Hideously overpriced!But they do a good job.  I remember back in Dallas, you can get a basic interior/exterior wash for around $12.  Forget about it here.I'll be going to Pelican Pointe instead whenever I head west toward the airport.",1
3,"This is tricky because I had a pretty lame experience AT Deluxe, but my haircut turns out to be awesome.So...I had to wait half an hour for my appt. to start, and I had a busy day. No one was apologetic or attentive at all. I know people get behind, but had they asked, I could have told them I didn't have time to wait. They didn't ask, I couldn't find them, so, I waited.I did get an awesome head massage/shampoo. And then I sat down in Matt's chair. He was quiet and dismissively apologetic about the wait, but we got down to business. I get the feeling I would like him outside of that setting, and he was perfectly pleasant and not over-talky, which I like. I had to leave before any kind of styling/blowdry, so I didn't know how it had gone, really.Fast forward a week to a wedding I was in. I ran out of time to do my hair, owing to vast amounts of time devoted to bride-pampering. Luckily, my haircut was good enough that I didn't need to style my hair -- AT ALL. I washed it, I put in some shine stuff, and that's all there was time for. It was shiny, bouncy, and the curl looked great.Matt did a great job. Will I go back? Probably not while there's still Plume...but if I were in a bind, it's a good back-pocket option. So, YAY to Matt, BOO to front-of-house.",1

I asked the ladies to make me a corsage and boutonnière for my wife and I, and I asked them to make sure it was fun, large, not your typical classy and clean but loud and obnoxious due to the style of the party. I let them have their way and these ladies NAILED it! Thank you!!",2

4,"OK. Decent place for pancakes and breakfast. Is it worth the ridiculous line that usually forms and runs out the door and around the corner? No. I'd rather go to Waffle House, eat, drive back home, get in comfy pj's and watch a game on the couch than still be there standing in line.Again, good food, worth the money, not worth the ridiculous wait. Go when you can walk right in and eat without a wait. It'll make it taste better. I promise.",2
4,"Amazingly good nachos with beef, I would go here just to get them. Pulled pork sandwich was very good too. Tons of good looking items on the menu. I tried to goto brunch on sunday and the wait was 2 hours so go early if you want breakfast or your gonna be waiting sucka.",2
2,"There are bars you can still smoke in?! Yuck. Sorry smokers (I used to be one so I get it) but yuck. The stink of smoke in my hair woke me up in the middle of the night after stopping in here and was so bad I had to get up to wash it before I could get back to sleep. That's not good.Definitely a dive, this bar is very dim and smokey. The bartender was friendly and came to take my order as soon as I walked up to the bar. The bloody mary I ordered wasn't that great or strong, though.  That's not good either.",0
5,A wonderful surprise. Was in the mood for Italian with my family. We enjoyed the meatballs the cannelloni.  Wine! Service was great. Light live acoustic guitar. Spinoni was perfect. Will be back!,2
4,"This place has the most amazing burger in philly. I've tried the village burger and the whiskey king. they're both amazing, but I don't know if spending an extra $15 for the foie gras is worth it. It is nice to have foie gras like maybe once a year. Although the village burger is only $11, after you add all the extra stuff that they charge ridiculous price for, like mushrooms ($5), the burger will come out to like $20. It's totally worth it though.",2
5,"Our favorite. Food is always consistently good, service is spot on....not to be missed. We love it!",2
3,"As motels go this one is very nice for the rate. Clean, comfortable and well-managed. You get what you pay for so the breakfast buffet is just OK. The pool is too small to swim laps (disappointing). The lobby area is spacious and comportable. If you are looking for a moderately priced place to sleep that is clean and comforable this will suit you just fine.",1

The boat was fast and when it turned, passengers could be seen feeling the effects of the G's.  In total, it was a great ride with a fun crew.  We would definitely recommend this ride and do it again.",2
5,Our new favorite for Asian cuisine take out! Finally I don't feel greasy and heavy after eating. Food tastes fresh and prepared so well. The crab Rangoon is the best I've found since I lived in the city. Highly recommend this place.,2
3,"I stopped by before a parade and met with my family who were visiting from out of town. Joanna was a great server and we loved the oysters! The place was busy and we waited about 10 minutes for our table. The hostess Jaclynne was very polite and made some great menu suggestions. However, we almost left the restaurant after witnessing one of the other staff members who I can only assume was a manager or supervisor, a black woman with very short hair, verbally accost our hostess in front of guests. It set a terrible tone for the experience and made me not want to stay and eat there. However, jaclynn continued to be kind to us despite being humiliated by the manager in front of our party as well as several guests and  we ended up staying. I felt terrible for the host and how the manager spoke to her in such an abusive and unprofessional manor. I stopped in the next night and enjoyed more oysters and fantastic service by the bartender Michelle and observed no abusive management.",1
3,"I heard somewhere that this place is one of Oprah's favorite restaurants if she's feeling a little bit adventurous.  I'm kind of bewildered.  Maybe I heard wrong.The place is quite an attraction, I'll give it that.  It's almost like you're visiting Disneyland's Frontierland.  We went during lunch time so the atmosphere was more casual and rustic.  I do hear that during dinner, it is more romantic.  The drive to this location is quite scenic and windy up into the hills of Santa Barbara.  And the place is tucked away alone all by itself off a side street.  During the Sunday lunch period, it's a frequent stop for Harley riders.  It can get super duper crowded cause the space is quite limited.We ordered the Beef Dip sandwich and the BBQ Babyback ribs, plus their famous chili.  All the dishes were very good.   Definitely better than average.  I would recommend it just for checking it out at least once for lunch, and once for dinner.  But other than that, it's okay.",1
5,"Sat outside for an early dinner before the Kentucky Derby. We had the chicken, ribs and macaroni, and the Brie and crab hand pie. All of it was great, the meat was all tasty and tender. The macaroni was very cheesy and had a hint of black pepper. The hand pie, which is new to the menu, was my personal favorite. You could taste the crab and it came surrounded by a well complimented creamy cocktail sauce. Highly suggest everything we had!",2
5,Yummmmmm.  Some of the best sushi in Reno!! By far the best and most friendly service. I would recommend everyone to give this place a chance.,2
5,"Loved this place! I have never been to an ice cream parlor in which they had Sweetened Condensed Milk as a drizzle! Ever since I was little, my dad got me on putting condensed milk on fruits, cake, crackers and smoothies. I didn't think anyone else knew about this until I came here! I just HAD to get it on my ice cream so I chose the strawberry shortcake with the toppings of graham crackers, whipped cream and strawberries. With of course the condensed milk as my drizzle all for $7. Can't beat that. Employees wore gloves and everything looked clean. Delicious will be coming back and bringing my dad lol.",2

5,"St. Louis Cemetery No. 1 is the oldest and most famous of the three. This is a must see on a visit to the Crescent City! I would also recommend signing up for a walking tour to fully appreciate what you are looking at. Notable sites to see include: renowned Voodoo priestess Marie Laveau, Homer Plessy, (of 1896's Plessy v. Ferguson), and Nicolas Cage's pyramid shaped tomb (he will reportedly be buried here).They are in the process of revamping some of the graves, but it would help if tourists stopped defacing the property. Leave your respects, leave a token of your appreciation if you will, but don't touch and don't take anything away with you except pictures.  You would think that this is common courtesy, but from what I witnessed this is not the case. OK, fine, I'll get off my soapbox now; thanks for listening! :)",2
3,Decent beer selection... that's all I was looking for.  Other than that I try to avoid Mobil's.  QT is more my style.,1
3,"The food was great, good enough that I will return, but the service was well... interesting. Our server was too friendly. Coming over often just to start conversation with us and even sitting down with us towards the end of the meal to talk to us. I appreciate friendly service, but this was a little too much. I however got the Bison burger and it was wonderful, and the beer was great too!",1
4,"Loved the environment here. Chilled on a comfy sofa in the lounge area watching the Saints game. Seat yourself and the bar food options are pretty good. We had the buffalo wings, artichoke dip with pita, and the free with Yelp checkin homemade chips. Everything was hot and tasty. The wings are overpowered with sauce and is a good balance of hot, tangy, and crispy. The pickled veggies were tasty and crunchy. Loved the homemade chips. Not too overpowering. Our waitress Nicki was awesome. Made sure we got what we needed.",2
5,"What a perfect location!This place is so mellow and has the tastiest food + a beautiful outdoor seating area with views of the beach! You might expect a beachfront restaurant to be on the pricier side, however the prices here are solid and not expensive at all. THUMBS UP!I could not have been happier with my dining experience. Best food + service! Padaro will surely become a frequent stop when cruisin' up the 101!",2

4,"I love me some MMM MMM MMM fall off the bone ribs, so I look forward to this event. Victorian Square in Sparks, NV is the place to be for Labor Day weekend. Great place to enjoy a time out with family and friends. Definitely the perfect event for all the meat lovers out there. If you show up early, parking won't be as bad as most people think. You'll be able to find parking some blocks away from the event. If you're lazy to walk, then there are parking lots where you can park and a shuttle can pick u up from there (check out website for the exact location: http://www.nuggetribcookoff.com/About-The-Event/About-The-Event.asp). Admission is FREE but your hunger will cost you.I suggest going with a big group so you can all share slab or half slab of ribs from each vendor. You'll get to sample more vendors that way, getting more bang for you buck. It's not worth it to get a sampler from the vendors because it's like $5 or $7 for 3 ribs. Usually they give you the bad part of the slab when you get the sampler, so it's a no no in my book. RIBS, KETTLE CORN, LEMONADE, ONION RINGS, FUNNEL CAKES and SOFT SERVE ICE CREAM! Throw your diet out the window and get down! It can get overwhelming wanting to try everything, but try to pace yourself. One complaint I have is the amount of shade there is because there is NONE! Make sure to wear a hat, sunglasses, and put on sunblock. You're going to need it standing in those loooooong lines under the BURNING SUN! The best place to cool off is in the John Nugget Casino. AC never felt so good. That's also the place to go if you want to purchase yourself a T-Shirt from the event.Overall, this is a nice little getaway for Labor Day weekend with your family and friends if you don't mind the heat. The busiest most crowded day will be on Labor Day. Traffic will be bumper to bumper, so I suggest going on any other day before then. Hope you all enjoy the RIBS, KETTLE CORN, LEMONADE, ONION RINGS, FUNNEL CAKES, and SOFT SERVE ICE CREAM! You're going to be feeling icky and a little more heavier after you're done but it's all about the GOOD TIMES!",2
5,"Forget The Company Burger - THIS is the best burger in New Orleans! I hadn't been here since it changed owners (and names), but I went tonight for the first time in over 5 years and was not disappointed.

Today, the fish is limp and appears frozen with the breading taking place as a factory and not at the store.The fries used to be special but now they're no different than any brand found in the frozen case at a grocery store.The clam chowder, on the other hand, is still pretty good. It doesn't seem any different from what was offered years ago.",1
5,"This bakery has amazingly talented chefs!  So far they have delivered a superb product that not only looks GREAT, but tastes sooo good.  The women are wonderful,  the prices are really good, and it's nice and clean inside.  They did a phenomenal job on my husband's 50th birthday cake and a super AWESOME job on my nephews Birthday cupcake cake.  I was just so overwhelmed by the beautiful job they did, and everyone at both parties were in aww of how great the designs came out.  I just cannot say enough about this bakery, and the wonderful job they do!",2
4,"I went there on Restaurant week ,food is terrible,i ordered soup(portion is too small,anyway i went from there hungry )but service is good",2
5,"I've been here several times both for a sit down brunch and to grab a quick piece of cake to take home. Brunch/ Dinner: make a reservation! It fills up quickly as there is limited space, especially when the patio isn't open. My favorite menu item is their quiche which changes daily but I've never had one I didn't like! I'm also a big fan of their tea. It comes in a cute little Cake Bake teapot and they have a really great selection. Now for the desserts: I've had several and you cannot go wrong!!! Cake, cookies, pies, brownies....They are all delicious and visually appealing as well (several glitter items!). The atmosphere is pretty magical and worth the trip!It can get a little pricey so definitely an every now and then treat.",2
5,Greatest place on earth?  Yes.  I love this place.  I love diner food. Every time I go I get the country fried steak breakfast and I am never disappointed.  Very cheap for a ton of food.  And the staff is always super nice.  I really love this place.  It is open all night so it is never a bad time to go.  Everything on their menu is always available.  I love this place so much.  I just got back so now I am going to take a nap...,2
4,"Great food! Cozy spot.  Service was good, but a bit slow.  Lemon corn cakes and beer biscuit were excellent.",2
5,"The Rincon Beach Club was the PERFECT location for our wedding reception venue. Carol made everything a breeze planning wise. My fiance and I just had to pick and choose what we wanted the place to look like, and Carol exceeded expectations. The food was amazing, the decorations so beautiful, and the photo booth so much fun! With all of the stress that comes with wedding planning, this venue made it so much easier, it is pretty much like a built in wedding planner. The Beach Club is a great indoor/outdoor space that offers a gorgeous and intimate setting, where guests really feel at home. All of our family/friends are still raving about how much fun our wedding was. Thank you so much again Carol, for making it a perfect day.",2
5,"The Blind Tiger is tucked in near some antique shops in Ybor City, unassuming to the eye walking by it save its awesome sign (of a blind tiger, of course) painted on the window. The interior is warm and inviting and the focus is on coffee, tea, and fresh baked goods with some clothing and homewares also for sale. What really impressed me however was that there is as much emphasis on the tea as the coffee: too often at coffeehouses tea is simply an afterthought and nothing more. Not here. There are about six selections of tea and they roughly cover the gamut of black, oolong, and green teas you'd hope to find. The coffee I had was very good and the baked goods include such favorites as banana bread, cakes, and cinnamon rolls--the latter apparently being what Blind Tiger is most known for locally. Overall it's a very neat little place and the interior is one which makes you feel no expense was spared to create a haven from the loudness and bustle of Ybor City, where it seems every other business is a bar or club. As much as I love bars, it's great to have a place that provides a degree of quiet and serenity.",2
1,"Quite possibly the perfect business model to fail if it wasn't for a sequestered clientel?  We visit New Orleans often, and it is an activity of ours to bet on how many beers or ingredients they are out of.  Bartenders rude and swearing. It's almost comical, we sit and listen to patrons asking for draft beers and mixed drinks and getting responses ""can't do that"".  They said ""No mules"", to at least 5 people as we sat for about 30 mins today.  2 out of 4 taps not working. What an absolute waste of opportunity.",0
5,"Everything about this Venue was AMAZING! We booked after only viewing one other venue because we were so in love, and it did not disappoint. Working with Judit was a pleasure, she and her staff were fantastic, they were quick to respond and were extremely accommodating. The food was DELICIOUS and the View is TO DIE FOR! Not to mention, it's secluded, it was so quiet and serene (so nice to not have someone's music blaring, or people watching your wedding who shouldn't be there and no highway noise!). Not only was this the venue we fell in love with, but it was one of the best deals. We would highly recommend this beautiful venue to any couple.",2
4,Great lil place that is a hidden gem. Food was fresh and delicious. Service was friendly and accommodating,2
4,"Great breakfast spot. Forget to check-in a lot, but have been coming here for months now. Recommend the biscuits instead of toast. They are delicious. Fruit cups change up what's in them but they are big and fresh. My favorite so far is runny eggs over corned beef hash. The scrapple is great, so are the breakfast potatoes.Today  I had the grilled pastrami on rye with Swiss and 1,000 dressing. The only thing missing is some sauerkraut. It would be so much better.The only breakfast dish I haven't been thrilled about is the sausage biscuit with gravy. The reason is because it's a sausage patty on an amazing biscuit. I wish they just put fresh ground sausage in the gravy instead.Overall it's a great place, with just a few changes I think it could be amazing and a spot people would travel to.",2
4,I stopped by when visiting town for 2 nights . I ate the chicken pot pie which wasn't really chicken pot pie but the insides with a bit of pie crust. Nonetheless it was good. It came part of a 3 course dinner for 20 bucks. I liked the atmosphere and the service was friendly . Just the perfect portion that I didn't feel too stuffed afterwards . I'd go back .,2
5,"One of the Best Coffee shops in town! They have a variety of non-dairy milk options and the cashier seemed very knowledgeable about the different types of coffee they offered and suggested a few of their house made syrups to add to my latte. I went with the almond maple syrup and oat milk, it tasted Amazing! I topped off my order with a vegan muffin that tasted just as good as the coffee. Thank you for offering vegan options! I will be back!",2
3,Come and order the Shark Attack.  Their presentation is delightful and witty.  The drink is tasty.  Otherwise the bar is packed and kind of frat-ish.,1
4,"This Wendy's just recently went through a much-needed renovation and it looks a lot better than it previously did. I walked in here to grab a lunch order recently around 12:30 and it was 80% full of dine-in customers. Unfortunately there was a clan of about a dozen senior citizens in front of me that couldn't make up their minds. I walked out, got back into my car and went right to the drive thru. The employee taking my order was clear through the speaker and very polite. I got to the window and realized I forgot an item and she added it on my order, updated my price and took care of it very easily. The drive thru process saved me a few minutes, as I'm sure the staff inside was just as efficient as the drive thru staff. My food was good and hot when I ate it. The fries didn't have a ton of salt, which I really prefer. My burger wasn't very big but was good. Inside was a very nice flat screen TV, which I have never seen in any Wendy's before. They also have the Coke freestyle machine, which is a very nice feature. This Wendy's is by far one of the nicer locations in all of Tampa. My issue with Wendy's is that they advertise these huge juicy burgers on TV. They look fantastic but when you unwrap them it's very disappointing as they are extremely small. I get that every restaurant does this during advertising, but Wendy's really exaggerates their product on TV. Wendy's is like a person on a dating website that displays their best pictures and their best qualities, except it's nothing like the pictures when you see it in person and is a major disappointment.",2
5,"The best food in Conshy hands down. Authentic Italian done right. Takes a little while to make food this good, so bring two bottles of wine and enjoy.  Striped bass w/ crab is on point!",2
5,"I've been a client of Tammy's at HiTech Nails for over 8 years. A friendly smile and clean salon will welcome you. I highly recommend their services! I recently moved 30 minutes away, but wouldn't think of going anywhere else.",2
3,There was too much driving and not enough touring.  We walked 15 min each in the cemetary and sculpture park.  The rest of the tour was a quick look and try to see out of the windows of a packed bus.  But it was a great way to see all sides of the big easy.  Donna was a knowledgeable tour guide.  She told jokes and stories about the history of this great city.,1
4,"This place has a great selection of anything you need, it's also very spacious. The staff is kind and quick, and I like that. They are a bit on the pricey side if you are purchasing hard liquor (which is why I am giving 4 stars instead of 5). If you are buying beer, or hard soda, the price is normal.",2
3,"I was super excited for Soy Bistro after reading so many great reviews, but just thought it was ""OK."" ‍My husband had the bibimbap, and while the rice was perfectly crispy at the bottom thanks to the hot skillet (you pay extra for it), there was a major lack of flavor and seasoning to the rice and vegetables. It wasn't bad, but was not great. I enjoyed a trio of Korean tacos, but phew!!! They were spicy! It was a little overwhelming, and I enjoy spice. They did have good flavor and I loved the sauce on them. My favorite was beef taco because it by far had the most flavor (I had pork and chicken as well). We had the dumplings also, and will pass on those if we ever return. Again, not bad at all, but not something I would spend money on again. The restaurant was clean and the service superb and friendly!",1
4,Great Djs that spin everything under the sun. This place makes me feel young and alive which has come to be rare in this city. I can't put my finger on it but something special is happening inside the Barbary. A feeling of culture and unity mixed with cheap drinks and beautiful people. The only cons are every time I go there I feel like I need tattoos and a cooler haircut. Disgusting bathrooms.,2
5,Absolutely love this little gem! My therapist Serena goes above and beyond to make me feel relaxed and renewed. I try to go at least once a month. I recommend this spa wholeheartedly.,2
5,This is a great place to shop and not spend a lot of money they always have coupons and discounts and have pretty good customer service. I enjoy coming here ever since Mervyns closed down.,2
5,"This is a fantastic shop. They were extremely quick and were completely honest. I hate going to mechanics since I usually get nickel and dimed since I'm not really car savvy, but Mike was great. There was another guy who was working on my car who I can't remember, but I absolutely will only come here. Decent prices and decent people!",2
5,Food is amazing. Best burger and fries in Quakertown - period. Seriously - their food is amazing.Their beer menu is extensive and the atmosphere is just awesome.Customer for life.,2
5,"My friends at work (connoisseurs of good food in the St. Louis area) introduced me to yet another very nice restaurant and that's Brio's!! I like everything about it - starting from the complimentary bread and chips to the bruschetta, pasta and salads !! Beautiful place.. The service adds to the charm !!",2
3,"Good lunch specials. You can get a small soup, appetizer, and entree for like 10 bucks.The food I had here was good. The ravioli soup was tasty, and the crab dumplings were super yummy (as was the plum sauce that came with them).My entree was pretty OK, nothing amazing. I'd love to come back and try more things, though. The menu is huge and I really don't feel like I can form a true opinion of this joint without trying more stuff!",1
5,"I brought in a truck that had been sitting under an oak tree for a year, and it was a mess.  The city gave me a warning that it was considered a ""junk"" car and would be towed if I didn't move it.  I put a new battery in it and took it to Mike's because it was closest and I was afraid of getting a ticket if I went drove any farther.  It took the better part of a day, but when I went to pick up my truck I couldn't believe it.  It looked like a brand new car.  Mike and his crew, as well as the two guys that own the car lot, are very nice, honest, and accommodating.  It was a very pleasant experience.",2
5,"Ricky was amazingly helpful - I'd locked myself out and had to walk around the corner to call Carpinteria Lock and Key- and he arrived and had my door unlocked before I returned. Amazing, fast service with a smile- thanks so much for solving my embarrassing slip-up before my face even had a chance to get red!",2
5,"This was surprisingly the best meal I have ever had.  Some things to know if you go and to avoid being asked to leave Sam's house:  1)  Check pretentiousness and indecisiveness at the door. 2)  Know what you want to order, he will tell you how to modify it accordingly3)  If you go close to closing time or try to rush him, you will be asked to leave4)  Sushi for everyone, that is why his prices are so reasonable.  5)  Everyone at one time?  Everyone will be asked to leave.  If you try to bring a huge group you will be asked to leave6)  Get ready for a enlightening experience....This is a very unique place because it is so unassuming. You would not go to Burger King and throw a tantrum because they did not have a Delmonico steak.  However, whatever Sam deciedes to serve to you, he will ""make it your way""  Sam Katakura knows what he is doing when he compares his sushi to the kind you buy at the grocery store.  He does not pretend to be something he is not, afterall, it is called ""Sam's sushi bar"" The food is satisfying, consistent, and good.  He will engage you in conversation and will leave you satisfied and wanting more.",2
2,"Being very generous with even two stars. It's a nice place to be to listen to entertainment and have a drink, however to eat.. is not acceptable. I was waiting over two hours to be seated and then when we were finally seated we were sitting down for over 30 minutes before we had to ask for a manager to even get us some drinks. Waited over an hour to even receive food, my salad was room temperature if not warm. My entree was pretty good, however the rest of my party's food wasn't even cooked properly. Drinks are strong which is great but i will never be returning here, ever.",0
5,"They should have a frequent buyers card because we spend a fortune here. When we are in Italy we eat gelato every day and Frost Gelato is very close in taste and texture. I would like to see some new exotic flavors but my favorites are sea salt caramel, stratchitella, mint chocolate chip, black cherry and at Christmas, peppermint! Love the peppermint.  And of course coconut. Yum They do a great job with service, presentation and of course taste.",2
2,This was my first time at Cheddars. When I walked in the hostess tried to seat us in an area with several dirty tables piled with used dishes. I asked to be seated somewhere else but I had to look down several aisles before I found a clean table without a bunch of dirty dishes and food on the floor.  Food was meh. Service was ok. Won't be coming back.,0
5,"My iPhone 5 was having trouble charging. I had tried cleaning the connector myself, but the problem was getting worse and worse. I assumed I needed a new dock connector. I had read that the connectors were easily damaged. I call several iPhone repair places. Most quoted $60 or $70 for the repair. iDope quoted me a very fair price of $46. Once I arrived, the technician did a thorough cleaning of the dock connector. He pulled out all sorts of dirt and fuzz that had accumulated from a few years of living in my pants pocket. He plugged it in and voila! It was charging again!He handed the phone back to me.  No charge!Thank you to the honest and fair, iDope!",2
4,"Excellent food! We had such a complicated order for hibachi, and they were so gracious. We had four tofu and vegetable, one vegan, and one chicken hibachi. For the rice, we had one without butter or eggs, four with butter but no eggs, and one with eggs and butter. As you can see, we were totally annoying. But our server and chef were so accommodating.  Our chef, Tanaka, was great...and the tofu was AMAZING. We also had miso soup, noodles, vegetables, and fried rice. Everything was great except the vegetables, which were pretty bland. We also got a side of mushrooms, which was a waste...not flavorful at all. Portions were big. Service was great!",2
2,"This was my very 1st time in New Orleans. It's been an amazing experience and so far, every single place I've eaten at has been AMAZING. So... I took a chance with The Praline Connection and walked in. Why? The ambiance and the restaurant, overall, looked nice. However... I would NEVER return to this place again, nor would I Ever RECOMMEND it to Anyone. APPETIZERS:I ordered the BBQ Oysters and..wow.. fucking wow...1st of all the oysters not in their shells. Instead they placed in a soup cup filled with  ""BBQ sauce"" that tasted like cheap Ketchup and Chef Boyarde! Disgusting! The oysters themselves were gooey.The garlic bread was God awful! It tasted like stale frozen garlic bread. To make matters worse, when I received these appetizers, they were cold.. It tasted and looked like they had been microwaved and left out.  I also ordered the Chicken wings. They were under cooked, cold and the sauce was nasty.  The other members of our party ordered entrees. They all said, ""This Sucks!""PROS: The service was great. The servers were all very polite and attentive. Restaurant was clean, nice tables, nice ambiance.",0
5,"Signature is professional, responsible and well run.  The valet's take pride in their service, which is refreshing.",2
5,"This place was so delicious! The coffee was great, the servers were all friendly and kind. They even accommodate very well to GF allergies. I am so impressed! We will definitely be back here more in the future!!",2
5,"I promised Keswick I would do a Yelp last week (sorry guys) and here it is! I don't really review a lot of things at all, but this is worth it. I had gotten a groupon for a basic tune up as a a gift and took my bike in, asking them to pay special attention to my super wobbly hub. I believe it was Brian who I spoke with and warned me that they might need to replace the wheel, promising he would call and update me. I left a little wary since usually when a bike shop tells me something like that it means they're trying to get a little something extra outta ya. But the next morning I got a call from Keswick telling me all they had to do was clean it up a little and that my bike was already done! They were also more than willing to let me keep it there for a few days since my work schedule overlapped their hours. Once I picked it up I was pleased to find that it actually rode better than when it was brand new, and I didn't end up paying more than what was already covered by the groupon. Keswick does a fast, thorough job while trying to keep it as cheap as possible for the customer, and keeping terrifically upbeat and friendly attitudes. One of the best bike shops in Philly.",2
2,"Been here 5 times and its hit and miss. The first time was pretty good, second time was ok but the last 3 times have been crappy. On one occasion they were really busy so I'd give them some leeway but the sushi is very inconsistent from visit to visit. Good value for lunch but not for dinner.",0
5,"Huge portions and very reasonable prices. It has a hole in the wall type of interior, but it's very clean kept. I've never had authentic Cambodian food anywhere else, so I can't make any comparisons, but I left with a very content (and large) belly!",2
4,"This is my favorite in Delaware.  The menu is simple and perfectly executed.  Rolls are reasonably priced, artfully made and are PACKED with fish!  I do believe they use flash-frozen sashimi grade fish, but the color, texture, taste and smell are perfect.  Easily the best spicy tuna I have ever had.  I think the secret is the kewpie mayo along w/ the right amount of sriracha and sichimi powder.  Frankly, I can't get enough of this place and have at times, eaten it every day for lunch for weeks.  I've gone as far as to pick it up for dinner AFTER having had it for lunch. Their introduction of short-grain brown sushi rice has been great!The Sushiman, YC Park is amazing to watch.  I've seen him skin a cucumber with a sword-like sushi knife in no time flat, in a single ribbon and then continue to shave it into a nori thin sheet for his tuna naruto roll roll.  The temaki are as big as a carnival iced cream cone.  You can barely finish one of them, there is so much fish in there.  The nigiri are beautiful.  Uniform pieces of fresh fish, perfectly perched on the best sushi rice I've ever had (just the right amount of vinegar and sugar).Skip the newly opened Kooma.  Save Mikimotos for a night out, but go to Tokyo for lunch!  The owners are lovely, so support them in this tough economy.  If you must eat sushi, eat it here!Why not 5 stars?  I have to save it for places that serve the local fresh fish, plucked out of the water that morning.  Let me know if you find a place that does!",2
4,Great little local diner. Food was all very fresh and well prepared and if the Hollandaise was from a packet it fooled me! Much better then the mediocre joint just down the street with the prime location.,2
4,"I've always liked banana pudding, but the Sweet Life Bakeshop made me a believer! I had a craving for something sweet after visiting the Liberty Bell, so quick yelp search led me here. It's a small bakery with seating for about five, so many people probably get sweets to go and enjoy them in a nearby park.All of the banana pudding options looked amazing and I was having a really hard time deciding what to get, but there was a friendly woman working there who patiently described each of the puddings to me. I decided to go with the sundae pudding, which was so tasty! It wasn't overly sweet which was perfect for me. I wish I lived in Philly so I could come here all the time! If you're in the area be sure to stop by! And don't forget to check in on yelp because you get 20% off of your order.",2
5,Sultans Schlep did a great job on very short notice on a move of some office furniture that required timeliness and discretion. Would not hesitate to use them again.,2
4,"Don't let the size of the place fool you!  It's tiny with small tables and you'll have to twist your way around the chairs to get to the back corner, but the food is great.I really appreciate that the rice they served with the curry was a good hefty helping and not dry like other places.  The curries are really rich with flavor...so good!  The price is pretty much about $10-12 per person on average for a standard plate.  It goes up a bit for the more fancy add-ins.And for those of you who can't handle spicy too well like me, don't forget to request it mild because they won't ask you how you like it and it'll come served with a kick like it's supposed to (still yummy though...just order two more glasses of water lol).  We ordered the pumpkin curry, pineapple curry, and pad thai.Love the food, but the venue is pretty cramped.",2
5,"Justin's a really nice guy.  He's easy to talk to in order to get the haircut you want.  You can park on the side street, so the location is good.What's not to like?",2
5,Outstanding place. The food is always great. Prices are fair. The only problem is the line. The line is always out the door. I guess that speaks to how good the place is though.,2
5,"Easy to get a special battery for my 2008 Jaguar. Eric great on the phone and then in person. Price right, no-charge installation done right and swiftly. 100% happy.",2
4,Very cool nostalgic-type bakery. You must try the pepperoni stromboli... NOW!,2
4,"Received surprise flowers from a friend across the country! Got a phone call from Amy's flowers in the morning and confirmed that we'd be home in the afternoon to receive them. They were wrapped in plastic, fresh, and smelled lovely. I might consider using Amy's in the future for my own floral needs!",2
5,Fantastic tacos and salads. Best part of getting stranded in Philly when our flight was canceled. I wish there was one in Vermont! Enjoy!,2
1,"Their pizza is pretty good, service is usually cool inside. But today I ordered a delivery for the first time, the driver was very insulting to me. When I open my door she asked me about a car across the street with a guy in the driver's seat. I replied ""I don't know,"" she said ""cus I don't wanna be set up to get robbed"". Mind you I already paid with my visa when I ordered, her behavior made me feel awkward as if I had done something wrong. I gave her the tip I had in my hand and said thank you, hoping that maybe if I remain polite she'll stop thinking so negative I just wanted some pizza not to be judged because of my surroundings or to be stereotyped.",0
1,"If I could give half a star I would, I'm from Tx, and anyone that thinks this is BBQ, I am willing to apologize to you for being led to believe that this is what BBQ is like.I ordered the sample platter, horrific, the chicken looked and tasted like frozen pressed meat, the ribs.... All cartilage, the sausage, bland.... The sauce.... Walmart basic sauce with cups of sugar thrown in.... Extremely overpriced for ummm.... A child's plate (what it seemed like). I would never recommend this place to anyone.",0
5,"Love Mood Cafe! The owner is very knowledgeable and is willing to take the time to make sure you get the best chaat. One of my favorite places to get Indian food in the city.Plus if you ask for mint in your drink, he picks it fresh from the bush! What could be better than that?",2
5,"Great donuts, great atmosphere.  Very good service.  The variety is fun and ever-changing.  Never made it for the sliders or brew, but maybe next time....  They do a really nice job of utilizing social media too....",2
5,"Perfect New Orleans experience! Live music, great food and drinks!There are refrigerators with cheeses, beer, water, and white wines. Reds as well as some whites/champagnes are displayed around the room. Plan on getting their early to secure a table and chairs. Next to the register there are buckets for ice to keep drinks cool. We were looking to try something new and the staff is well versed in their inventory and gave us great advice.Great ""pick your own"" cheese plate, served with delicious toast points. Be sure to bring some cash if you plan on ordering from the chef cooking outback. You can visit their website and see the calendar of rotating chefs and musicians.",2
5,Fantastic Detroit family has joined the revolution of Madeira Way! Incredibly friendly staff with authentic Italian cuisine! The venue is the former Subway location and well move over Fast food subs and dive in to a REAL Italian sub! This place will be very successful!,2
2,"I saw Big Data when they came to town at the Knitting Factory. Some things:The area is really skeazy. I am happy Reno is trying to change the image of the city, but that cannot be accomplished over night and this place is super creepy.The sound quality is horrible. If you want to REALLY hear the band you paid to see, go somewhere else. The building is not shaped right for a concert venue and because of it, the sound will sooner bust out your eardrums.",0
5,"I have always dreaded going to the hair salon.  I hated the phony atmosphere of most places and I really dreaded the small talk I would be forced to have with my stylist.  Maybe I am unusually insecure, but I always felt intimidated in most salons.  Then, one day a couple of years ago, I wandered into Andre's salon and I never looked back.  Andre is warm and personable and made me feel at ease immediately.  Right off the bat, we connected on a topic I care about--dogs--and I didn't feel uncomfortable at all.  Oh, and the cut and color were fantastic!  My highlights last longer than highlights I have received from any other salon.For the past year or so, Christopher has been styling my hair and I LOVE him to death.  He is incredibly sweet, down-to-earth and talented!  My hair looks amazing for days after he styles it and, try as I might, I can never get it to look as good as he can.The last time I was at the salon, Christopher, Leah and I had a blast reminiscing about '80s fashion!  I can't remember a time when I enjoyed going to the hair salon (which is probably because I never have!).Also, back in the spring, I asked Andre if he would be interested in donating a gift for a charity 5K I was helping to organize.  Being the wonderful person he is, Andre didn't hesitate and put together a beautiful basket that was a hit at the race!  Andre has a good heart and that it what I love about going to his salon!I also love that clients can schedule appointments online through schedulicity!Great prices, great cuts, great color, great space, convenient scheduling options and, most importantly, great people--you will not regret choosing Andre for your next cut or color!",2
5,"My favorite hotel!!!! along with their sister Hotel the Avalon next door. I live about a hour away but come as often as I can because there's so much to do here. The pool, food and drinks are amazing, along with their extremely friendly staff. Perfect for a special occasion, birthday or just a relaxing get away. They are also pet friendly which is a huge plus. They have a shuttle to take you downtown and pick you up and they always have something fun going on at night.",2
